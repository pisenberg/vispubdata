"Summary form only given, as follows. Historically, scientific visualization has been carried out in two primary modes: interactive on desktop computers, and batch on high-performance computers. The next decade will see a merging of these two approaches with the advent of high-speed networking. The networking is hierarchical in speed from Ethernet to FDDI to HiPPI. This network effectively unites desktop computers with higher-value remote resources into a single metacomputer. To take advantage of this new hardware configuration, distributed visualization software is being developed which allows the flexibility of the local workstation to be coupled with the computing power of distant supercomputers. Examples are discussed for 2D raster graphics and 3D rendered surface and volumetric graphics. These new capabilities are having a remarkable impact on computational science.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/175767/","LOCKED","175767","Nato Centre for Supercomput.

"An experiment in exploratory data visualization using a massively parallel processor is described. In exploratory data visualization, it is typically not known what is being looked for: instead, the data are explored with a variety of visualization techniques that can illuminate its nature by demonstrating patterns in it. With this approach, the authors were able to find new features in some of their oldest datasets and to create more vivid presentations of familiar features in these datasets. Their experience has also led to a better understanding of the nature of the exploratory visualization and has resulted in some formal representations of the interaction process in this environment.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/175809/","LOCKED","175809","Dept. of Comput.

"A method is presented for the visualization of 3D vector fields. The stream polygon, which is a regular, n-sided polygon, oriented normal to the local vector, can present local deformations due to rigid body rotation and both normal and shear strain. The effect of translation and scalar functions can be represented by sweeping the stream polygon along the streamline, and by appropriately varying the radius and shading the surface of the resulting streamtube. A mathematical foundation for the stream is developed, and examples with application to velocity field visualization are provided.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/175789/","LOCKED","175789","General Electric Corp.

"Chemical reactions occurring within complex domains, such as fractals, can display behavior which differs radically from the expectation of classical chemical kinetics. Rather than relaxing to a uniform distribution at the steady state, these nonclassical systems display large-scale order on many scales. Such self-organization is difficult to measure using the usual statistical techniques, but is visually apparent.

"A method of visual comparison is described, that provides the scientist with a unique tool to study the qualitative relationships between three sequences of numbers or symbols. The program displays a 3D shape containing the sequence similarities and differences, which manifest themselves as simple geometric shapes and colors that a human observer can easily detect and classify. The method presents all possible correlations to the user, giving it a considerable advantage over existing sequence comparison tools that only search for a programmed subset of all possible correlations. Thus, using this technique, researchers may detect sequence similarities that other analytic methods might completely overlook. The program can also filter out undesirable or insignificant correlations. The technique is easily adapted to a wide range of applications.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/175797/","LOCKED","175797","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Worchester Polytech.

"Blood movement investigated by magnetic resonance (MR) velocity mapping is generally presented in the form of velocity components in one or more chosen velocity encoding directions. By viewing these components separately, it is difficult for MR practitioners to conceptualize and comprehend the underlying flow structures, especially when the image data have strong background noise. A flow visualization technique that adapts the idea of particle tracing used in classical fluid dynamics for visualizing flow is presented. The flow image processing relies on the strong correlation between the principal flow direction estimated from the distribution of the modulus of the velocity field and the direction derived from the raw image data. By correlation calculation, severe background noise can be eliminated. Flow pattern rendering and animation provide an efficient way for representing internal flow structures.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/175801/","LOCKED","175801","Dept. of Comput., Imperial Coll., London Univ., UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37276270800","1","G.Z.

"A set of volume visualization tools that are based on the use of recursive ray tracing as the primary vehicle for realistic volume imaging is presented. The tools include shadows, mirrors, specularity, and constructive solid geometry. The underlying representation for the ray tracer is a 3-D raster of voxels that holds the discrete form of the scene. Unlike traditional volume rendering techniques, the discrete recursive ray tracer models many illumination phenomena by traversing discrete rays in voxel space. The approach provides true ray tracing of sampled or computed datasets, as well as ray tracing of hybrid scenes where sampled or computed data are intermixed with geometric models and enhances the understanding of complex biomedical datasets.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/175805/","LOCKED","175805","Dept. of Comput.

"A description is given of a software system, TOPO, that numerically analyzes and graphically displays topological aspects of a three-dimensional vector field, v, to produce a single, relatively simple picture that characterizes v. The topology of v considered consists of its critical points (where v=0), their invariant manifolds, and the integral curves connecting these invariant manifolds. The field in the neighborhood of each critical point is approximated by the Taylor expansion. The coefficients of the first nonzero term of the Taylor expansion around a critical point are the 3*3 matrix Delta v. Critical points are classified by examining Delta v's eigenvalues. The eigenvectors of Delta v span the invariant manifolds of the linearized field around a critical point. Curves integrated from initial points on the eigenvectors a small distance from a critical point connect with other critical points (or the boundary) to complete the topology. One class of critical surfaces that is important in computational fluid dynamics is analyzed.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/175773/","LOCKED","175773","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37377256900","1","A.

"Methods for displaying scientific data using textures and raster operations rather than geometric techniques are described. The flexibility and simplicity of raster operations allow a greater choice of visualization techniques with only a small set of basic operations. In addition, texture mapping techniques that allow the representation of several variables simultaneously, without a high degree of clutter, are shown. The combination of traditional geometric techniques, image composition techniques, and image rendering techniques can be integrated into a single framework for the display of scientific data.

An earlier technique (shear decomposition) is extended to 3D, and it is shown how this can be mapped onto a data-parallel architecture using only grid communication during the resampling associated with the rotation. The rendering uses efficient parallel computation constructs that allow one to use sophisticated shading models and still maintain high-speed throughout.

"A method for visualizing hierarchically structured information is described. The tree-map visualization technique makes 100% use of the available display space, mapping the full hierarchy onto a rectangular region in a space-filling manner. This efficient use of space allows very large hierarchies to be displayed in their entirety and facilitates the presentation of semantic information. Tree-maps can depict both the structure and content of the hierarchy. However, the approach is best suited to hierarchies in which the content of the leaf nodes and the structure of the hierarchy are of primary importance, and the content information associated with internal nodes is largely derived from their children.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/175815/","LOCKED","175815","Dept. of Comput.

"Techniques for visualizing mathematical objects in four-dimensional (4D) space that exploit four-dimensional lighting effects are explored. The geometry of image production, stereography, and shadows in 4D is analyzed. Alternatives for smooth and specular shaded rendering of curves, surfaces, and solids in 4D are examined and a new approach that systematically converts curves or surfaces into uniquely renderable solids in 4D space by attaching spheres or circles to each point is proposed. Analogs of 3D shading methods are used to produce volume renderings that distinguish objects whose 3D projections from 4D are identical. Analyzing the procedures needed to justify and evaluate a system as this for teaching humans to 'see' in four dimensions leads to the proposal of a generally applicable four-step visualization paradigm.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/175821/","LOCKED","175821","Dept. of Comput.

"A computer was used to help study the packing of equal spheres in dimension four and higher. A candidate of the densest packing in 4-space is described. The configuration of 24 spheres touching a central sphere in this packing is shown to be rigid, unlike the analog in 3-space, in which the spheres can slide past each other. A system for interactively manipulating and visualizing such configurations is described. The Voronoi cell for a sphere is the set of points closer to its center than to any other sphere center in the packing. The packing density is the ratio of a sphere's volume to the average of the volumes of the Voronoi cells. A method of constructing Voronoi cells and computing their volumes that works in any dimension is presented. Examples of Voronoi cell volumes are given.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/175785/","LOCKED","175785","California Univ., Davis, CA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267387800","1","N.

"Partial automation of the task of designing graphical displays that effectively depict the data to be visualized through cooperative computer-aided design (CCAD) is described. This paradigm combines the strengths of manual and automated design by interspersing guiding design operations by the human user with the exploration of design alternatives by the computer. The approach is demonstrated in the context of the IVE design system, a CCAD environment for the design of scientific visualizations using a set of design rules that combine primitive visualization components in different ways. These alternatives are presented graphically to the user, who can browse through them, select the most promising visualization, and refine it manually.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/175819/","LOCKED","175819","Harvard Univ., Cambridge, MA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37378493100","1","S.

"Television coverage of golf fails to bring the viewer an appreciation of the complex topography of a golf green and how that topography affects the putting of golf balls. A computer graphics simulation that enhances the viewer's perception of these features using shaded polygonal models of the actual golf green used in tournaments is presented. Mathematical modeling of the golf ball's trajectory on its way toward the hole further enhances viewer understanding. A putting difficulty map assesses the relative difficulty of putting from each location on the green to a given pin position. The object-oriented system is written in C and runs on a variety of 3D graphics workstations.

"VISUAL 3, a highly interactive environment for the visualization of 3D volumetric scientific data, is described. The volume can be broken up in a structured or unstructured manner, and the problem can be static or unsteady in time. Because the data are volumetric and all the information can be changing, traditional CAD techniques are not appropriate. Therefore, VISUAL3 was developed using intermediate mode-rendering methods. A unique aspect of VISUAL3 is the dimensional windowing approach coupled with cursor mapping, which allows efficient pointing in 3D space. VISUAL3 is composed of a large number of visualization tools that can be generally classified into identification, scanning, and probing techniques.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/175837/","LOCKED","175837","Dept. of Aeronaut. & Astronaut, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282898700","1","R.

"Techniques for displaying 3D isovalues of scalar fields such as stress within a solid finite-element model generally involve examining each element for values of interest. An inexpensive, straightforward method is discussed for reducing the number of elements searched for such isovalues. It takes advantage of one traversal of the element data to yield a compact classification of the model by result values and ranges, with no sorting required. This data structure can then relate any scalar isovalue to a set of element groups which are closely inclusive of the isovalue. This method is intended for applications requiring repeated access to the analysis data, such as animation and interactive rendering of isosurfaces and scalar fields. While applicable to general volume visualization problems, it is particularly well suited to optimizing real-valued continuum field results such as those found in finite-element data.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/175780/","LOCKED","175780","Swanson Analysis Systems Inc., Houston, PA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38179868800","1","R.S.

The SDSC Image Tool suite provides a simple, extensible, and portable mechanism for the support of a variety of common image formats so that tool-writers can concentrate on the task in hand, rather than on the quirks of a particular image file format. Users of such tools are able to work with images generated from a variety of sources, without being restricted to an arbitrary standard format. The SDSC Visualization Printing suite creates a unified view of hardcopy devices.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/175814/","LOCKED","175814","San Diego Supercomput.

"The authors have achieved rates as high as 15 frames per second for interactive direct visualization of 3D data by trading some function for speed, while volume rendering with a full complement of ramp classification capabilities is performed at 1.4 frames per second. These speeds have made the combination of region selection with volume rendering practical for the first time. Semantic-driven selection, rather than geometric clipping, has proved to be a natural means of interacting with 3D data. Internal organs in medical data or other regions of interest can be built from preprocessed region primitives. The resulting combined system has been applied to real 3D medical data with encouraging results.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/175778/","LOCKED","175778","North Carolina Univ., Chapel Hill, NC, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37418915200","1","T.S.

"A mathematical data model for scientific visualization that is based on the mathematics of fiber bundles is presented. Previous results are extended to the case of piecewise field representations (associated with grid-based data representations), and a general mathematical model for piecewise representations of fields on irregular grids is presented. The various types of regularity that can be found in computational grids and techniques for compact field representation based on each form of regularity are discussed. These techniques can be combined to obtain efficient methods for representing fields on grids with various regular or partially regular structures.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/175818/","LOCKED","175818","Dept. of Theor. & Appl.

"Volumetric rendering is applied to the interpretation of atomic-scale data generated from quantum molecular dynamics computations. In particular, for silicon computations it is found that volumetric visualization of the computed 3D electronic charge density is a valuable tool for identifying defect states in silicon lattices in which oxygen atoms occur as impurities. Rendering of several judiciously selected ranges of charge density in translucent colors provides an effective means of identifying broken or altered molecular bonds and induced charge excesses in the lattice. The resulting 3D images reveal important features missed previously in 2D charge density contour maps. Stereoscopic 'blink comparison' of image pairs is an extremely valuable way to study the structural differences among various configurations, and animation provides significant insight into the molecular dynamics.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/175786/","LOCKED","175786","IBM Thomas J.

"Two basic principles for interactive visualization of high-dimensional data-focusing and linking-are discussed. Focusing techniques may involve selecting subsets, dimension reduction, or some more general manipulation of the layout information on the page or screen. A consequent of focusing is that each view only conveys partial information about the data and needs to be linked so that the information contained in individual views can be integrated into a coherent image of the data as a whole. Examples are given of how graphical data analysis methods based on focusing and linking are used in applications including linguistics, geographic information systems, time series analysis, and the analysis of multi-channel images arising in radiology and remote sensing.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/175794/","LOCKED","175794","Bellcore, Morristown, NJ, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591245700","1","A.

"A technique is presented for plotting large multivariate data sets that involves the mapping of n independent variable dimensions on to a single hierarchical horizontal axis with a single dependent variable being plotted on the vertical axis. The emphasis is on visual statistical analysis of either discrete variables or continuous variables that have been sampled on, or binned to, a regular n-dimensional lattice. The general applicability of the technique is discussed, and ways are explored of representing the hierarchical data-driven symbols that are particularly well suited to a variety of visual analysis tasks.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/175796/","LOCKED","175796","Mihalisin Associates, Ambler, PA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37314757900","1","T.
