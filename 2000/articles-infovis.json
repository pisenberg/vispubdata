Analysis and exploration tasks place significant demands on the interfaces to these databases. Because of the size of the data sets, dense graphical representations are more effective for exploration than spreadsheets and charts. Furthermore, because of the exploratory nature of the analysis, it must be possible for the analysts to change visualizations rapidly as they pursue a cycle involving first hypothesis and then experimentation. The authors present Polaris, an interface for exploring large multi-dimensional databases that extends the well-known Pivot Table interface. The novel features of Polaris include an interface for constructing visual specifications of table based graphical displays and the ability to generate a precise set of relational queries from the visual specifications. The visual specifications can be rapidly and incrementally developed, giving the analyst visual feedback as they construct complex queries and visualizations.","article_number":"885086","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885086","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885086/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization 2000.

The mining of sequential patterns is designed to find patterns of discrete events that frequently happen in the same arrangement along a timeline. Like association and clustering, the mining of sequential patterns is among the most popular knowledge discovery techniques that apply statistical measures to extract useful information from large datasets. As out computers become more powerful, we are able to mine bigger datasets and obtain hundreds of thousands of sequential patterns in full detail. With this vast amount of data, we argue that neither data mining nor visualization by itself can manage the information and reflect the knowledge effectively. Subsequently, we apply visualization to augment data mining in a study of sequential patterns in large text corpora. The result shows that we can learn more and more quickly in an integrated visual data-mining environment.","article_number":"885097","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885097","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885097/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization 2000.

The user interface of traditional 3D browsers provides simple navigation tools that allow the user to modify the camera parameters such as orientation, position and focal. Using these tools, it is frequent that, after some movements, the user is lost in the virtual 3D space and usually tries to restart from the beginning. We present how the 3D navigation problem is addressed in the context of the CyberNet project (Abel et al., 2000). Our underlying principle is to help the user navigate by adapting the navigation tool to the virtual world. We feel that the navigation schemes provided by the 3D browsers are too generic for some specific 3D tools and we have developed adaptive navigation features that are dependent on the 3D metaphor used for visualizing the information and on the user's task.","article_number":"885104","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885104","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885104/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization 2000.

In fact, as the taxonomic analysis in the paper will show, many of the techniques share similar operating steps that can easily be reused.

With electric industry restructuring and the move towards having a single entity, such as an independent system operator or pool, operate a much larger system, this need has become more acute. This paper presents several power system visualization techniques to help in this task. These techniques include animation of power system flow values, contouring of bus and transmission line flow values, data aggregation techniques and interactive 3D data visualization.","article_number":"885101","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885101","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885101/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization 2000.

It helps designers define and evaluate the initial design space by using search algorithms to generate sets of feasible solutions. Two algorithm visualization techniques, Kaleidoscope and Lattice, and one visualization of n-dimensional data, MAP, are used to externalize the machine's problem solving strategies and the tradeoffs as a result of using these strategies. After a short training period, users are able to discover tactics to explore design space effectively, evaluate new design solutions, and learn important relationships among design criteria, search speed and solution quality. We thus propose that visualization can serve as a tool for interactive intelligence, ie., human-machine collaboration for solving complex problems.","article_number":"885103","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885103","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885103/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization 2000.

To further facilitate understanding and analysis, many visualization environments have special features known as portals, which are sub-windows of a data canvas. Portals provide a way to display multiple graphical representations simultaneously, in a nested fashion. This makes portals an extremely powerful and flexible paradigm for data visualization. Unfortunately, with this flexibility comes complexity. There are over a hundred possible ways each portal can be configured to exhibit different behaviors. Many of these behaviors are confusing and certain behaviors can be inappropriate for a particular setting. It is desirable to eliminate confusing and inappropriate behaviors. The authors construct a taxonomy of portal behaviors and give recommendations to help designers of visualization systems decide which behaviors are intuitive and appropriate for a particular setting. They apply these recommendations to an example setting that is fully visually programmable and analyze the resulting reduced set of behaviors. Finally, the authors consider a real visualization environment and demonstrate some problems associated with behaviors that do not follow their recommendations.","article_number":"885087","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885087","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885087/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization 2000.

MGV's only assumption is that the vertex set of the underlying digraph corresponds to the set of leaves of a predetermined tree T. MGV builds an out-of-core graph hierarchy and provides mechanisms to plug in arbitrary visual representations for each graph hierarchy slice. Navigation from one level to another of the hierarchy corresponds to the implementation of a drill-down interface. In order to provide the user with navigation control and interactive response, MGV incorporates a number of visualization techniques like interactive pixel-oriented 2D and 3D maps, statistical displays, multi-linked views, and a zoomable label based interface. This makes the association of geographic information and graph data very natural. MGV follows the client-server paradigm and it is implemented in C and Java-3D. We highlight the main algorithmic and visualization techniques behind the tools and point out along the way several possible application scenarios. Our techniques are being applied to multi-graphs defined on vertex sets with sizes ranging from 100 million to 250 million vertices.","article_number":"885089","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885089","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885089/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization 2000.

Therefore, systems supporting the users to design appropriate visualizations are of great importance. The GADGET (Goal-oriented Application Design Guidance for modular visualization EnvironmenTs) system, which has been developed by the authors (1997), interactively helps users to design scientific visualization applications by presenting appropriate MVE (Modular Visualization Environment) prototypes according to the specification of the visualization goals expressed mainly with the Wehrend matrix (S. Wehrend & C. Lewis, 1990). This paper extends this approach in order to develop a system named GADGET/IV, which is intended to provide the users with an environment for semi-automatic design of information visualization (IV) applications. To this end, a novel goal-oriented taxonomy of IV techniques is presented. Also, an initial design of the system architecture and user assistance flow is described. The usefulness of the GADGET/IV system is illustrated with example problems of Web site access frequency analysis.","article_number":"885093","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885093","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885093/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization 2000.

The current dominance of spatial metaphors in information visualization research is the result of the realization that those cognitive skills also have value in the exploration and analysis of non-geographic information. While mapping or landscape metaphors are routinely used in this field, there is a noticeable lack of consideration for existing cartographic expertise. This is especially apparent whenever problematic issues are encountered, such as graphic complexity or feature labeling. There are a number of areas in which a cartographic outlook could provide a valuable perspective. This paper discusses how geographic and cartographic notions may influence the design of visualizations for textual information spaces. Map projections, generalization, feature labeling and map design issues are discussed.","article_number":"885095","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885095","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885095/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization 2000.
