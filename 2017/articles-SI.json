Clique communities have been recognized as a powerful concept for describing cohesive structures in networks. We propose an approach that extends the computation of clique communities by considering persistent homology, a topological paradigm originally introduced to characterize and compare the global structure of shapes. Our persistence-based algorithm is able to detect clique communities and to keep track of their evolution according to different edge weight thresholds. We use this information to define comparison metrics and a new centrality measure, both reflecting the relevance of the clique communities inherent to the network. Moreover, we propose an interactive visualization tool based on nested graphs that is capable of compactly representing the evolving relationships between communities for different thresholds and clique degrees. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on various network types.","article_number":"8017588","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8017588","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017588/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017588/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"822","end_page":"831","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Tools","Complex networks","Visualization","Layout","Algorithm design and analysis","Shape","Transmission line matrix methods"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Persistent homology","topological persistence","cliques","complex networks","visual analysis"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2744058","title":"On the Treatment of Field Quantities and Elemental Continuity in FEM Solutions","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":2,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"SCI InstituteUniversity of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086212768","id":37086212768,"full_name":"Ashok Jallepalli","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"School of MathematicsUniversity of East Anglia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086221523","id":37086221523,"full_name":"Julia Docampo-Sánchez","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"School of MathematicsUniversity of East Anglia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37825240600","id":37825240600,"full_name":"Jennifer K.

To state this in another way: the interpretation of data generated by simulation needs to be consistent with the numerical schemes that underpin the specific solver technology. As the verifiable visualization literature has demonstrated: visual artifacts produced by the introduction of either explicit or implicit data transformations, such as data resampling, can sometimes distort or even obfuscate key scientific features in the data. In this paper, we focus on the handling of elemental continuity, which is often only $C^{0}$ continuous or piecewise discontinuous, when visualizing primary or derived fields from FEM or FVM simulations. We demonstrate that traditional data handling and visualization of these fields introduce visual errors. In addition, we show how the use of the recently proposed line-SIAC filter provides a way of handling elemental continuity issues in an accuracy-conserving manner with the added benefit of casting the data in a smooth context even if the representation is element discontinuous.","article_number":"8017592","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8017592","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017592/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017592/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"903","end_page":"912","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Finite element analysis","Data models","Mathematical model","Pipelines","Tools","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Flow Visualization","discontinuous Galerkin (dG) methods","continuous Galerkin (cG) methods","finite element methods (FEM)","finite volume methods","filtering techniques","Scalar Field Data","Irregular and Unstructured Grids","Extraction of Surfaces((Isosurfaces)"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2745158","title":"TreePOD: Sensitivity-Aware Selection of Pareto-Optimal Decision Trees","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":3,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077342500","id":37077342500,"full_name":"Thomas Mühlbacher","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"ETH Zurich","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086242352","id":37086242352,"full_name":"Lorenz Linhardt","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"University of Vienna","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275858700","id":37275858700,"full_name":"Torsten Möller","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282562500","id":37282562500,"full_name":"Harald Piringer","author_order":4}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Balancing accuracy gains with other objectives such as interpretability is a key challenge when building decision trees. However, this process is difficult to automate because it involves know-how about the domain as well as the purpose of the model. This paper presents TreePOD, a new approach for sensitivity-aware model selection along trade-offs. TreePOD is based on exploring a large set of candidate trees generated by sampling the parameters of tree construction algorithms. Based on this set, visualizations of quantitative and qualitative tree aspects provide a comprehensive overview of possible tree characteristics. Along trade-offs between two objectives, TreePOD provides efficient selection guidance by focusing on Pareto-optimal tree candidates. TreePOD also conveys the sensitivities of tree characteristics on variations of selected parameters by extending the tree generation process with a full-factorial sampling. We demonstrate how TreePOD supports a variety of tasks involved in decision tree selection and describe its integration in a holistic workflow for building and selecting decision trees. For evaluation, we illustrate a case study for predicting critical power grid states, and we report qualitative feedback from domain experts in the energy sector. This feedback suggests that TreePOD enables users with and without statistical background a confident and efficient identification of suitable decision trees.","article_number":"8019878","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8019878","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019878/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019878/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"174","end_page":"183","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Decision trees","Vegetation","Data models","Buildings","Visualization","Measurement","Focusing"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Model selection","classification trees","visual parameter search","sensitivity analysis","Pareto optimality"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2745298","title":"TACO: Visualizing Changes in Tables Over Time","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":4,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"St. Pölten University of Applied Sciences, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085861296","id":37085861296,"full_name":"Christina Niederer","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085497544","id":37085497544,"full_name":"Holger Stitz","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086231064","id":37086231064,"full_name":"Reem Hourieh","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"St. Pölten University of Applied Sciences, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086235960","id":37086235960,"full_name":"Florian Grassinger","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"TU Wien, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267339500","id":37267339500,"full_name":"Wolfgang Aigner","author_order":5},{"affiliation":"Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403918900","id":37403918900,"full_name":"Marc Streit","author_order":6}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Multivariate, tabular data is one of the most common data structures used in many different domains. Over time, tables can undergo changes in both structure and content, which results in multiple versions of the same table. A challenging task when working with such derived tables is to understand what exactly has changed between versions in terms of additions/deletions, reorder, merge/split, and content changes. For textual data, a variety of commonplace “diff” tools exist that support the task of investigating changes between revisions of a text. Although there are some comparison tools which assist users in inspecting differences between multiple table instances, the resulting visualizations are often difficult to interpret or do not scale to large tables with thousands of rows and columns. To address these challenges, we developed TACO, an interactive comparison tool that visualizes the differences between multiple tables at various levels of detail. With TACO we show (1) the aggregated differences between multiple table versions over time, (2) the aggregated changes between two selected table versions, and (3) detailed changes between the selected tables. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show its application by means of two usage scenarios.","article_number":"8017626","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8017626","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017626/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017626/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"677","end_page":"686","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Tools","Data visualization","Heating systems","Games","Encoding","Bars","Biology"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Table comparison","matrix","difference visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2745258","title":"Towards a Systematic Combination of Dimension Reduction and Clustering in Visual Analytics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":5,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech Department of Computer Science","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233577000","id":38233577000,"full_name":"John Wenskovitch","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech Department of Statistics","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086233274","id":37086233274,"full_name":"Ian Crandell","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech Department of Computer Science","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273204200","id":37273204200,"full_name":"Naren Ramakrishnan","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech Department of Statistics","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38241765600","id":38241765600,"full_name":"Leanna House","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech Department of Statistics","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38236156800","id":38236156800,"full_name":"Scotland Leman","author_order":5},{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech Department of Computer Science","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37419565900","id":37419565900,"full_name":"Chris North","author_order":6}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Dimension reduction algorithms and clustering algorithms are both frequently used techniques in visual analytics.

Our approach allows them to deal with the increasingly complex DNA objects that they are designing, to improve their features, and to add novel functions in a way that no existing single-scale approach offers today. For this purpose we collaborated with DNA nanotechnology experts to design a set of ten semantic scales. These scales take the DNA's chemical and structural behavior into account and depict it from atoms to the targeted architecture with increasing levels of abstraction. To create coherence between the discrete scales, we seamlessly transition between them in a well-defined manner. We use special encodings to allow experts to estimate the nanoscale object's stability. We also add scale-adaptive interactions that facilitate the intuitive modification of complex structures at multiple scales. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach on an experimental use case. Moreover, feedback from our collaborating domain experts confirmed an increased time efficiency and certainty for analysis and modification tasks on complex DNA structures. Our method thus offers exciting new opportunities with promising applications in medicine and biotechnology.","article_number":"8017632","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8017632","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017632/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017632/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"1014","end_page":"1024","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["DNA","Nanostructures","Tools","Nanoscale devices","Shape","Visualization","Semantics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Nano","nanotechnology","assembly","multiscale","abstraction","DNA","origami","scale-adaptive modification"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2745279","title":"Supporting Handoff in Asynchronous Collaborative Sensemaking Using Knowledge-Transfer Graphs","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":8,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"FX Palo Alto Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38024987300","id":38024987300,"full_name":"Jian Zhao","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Autodesk Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085739236","id":37085739236,"full_name":"Michael Glueck","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Inria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591317800","id":37591317800,"full_name":"Petra Isenberg","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Inria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37395495900","id":37395495900,"full_name":"Fanny Chevalier","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"Autodesk Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085722798","id":37085722798,"full_name":"Azam Khan","author_order":5}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"During asynchronous collaborative analysis, handoff of partial findings is challenging because externalizations produced by analysts may not adequately communicate their investigative process.

The Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry explores 4D visualizations over these datasets for virtual construction planning. However, existing solutions lack adequate visual mechanisms to inspect the underlying schedule and make inconsistencies readily apparent. The goal of this paper is to apply best practices of information visualization to improve 4D analysis of construction plans. We first present a review of previous work that identifies common use cases and limitations. We then consulted with AEC professionals to specify the main design requirements for such applications. These guided the development of CasCADe, a novel 4D visualization system where task sequencing and spatio-temporal simultaneity are immediately apparent. This unique framework enables the combination of diverse analytical features to create an information-rich analysis environment.

Both fields provide a broad set of labeling strategies, whereby machine learning (and in particular active learning) follows a rather model-centered approach and visual analytics employs rather user-centered approaches (visual-interactive labeling). Both approaches have individual strengths and weaknesses. In this work, we conduct an experiment with three parts to assess and compare the performance of these different labeling strategies. In our study, we (1) identify different visual labeling strategies for user-centered labeling, (2) investigate strengths and weaknesses of labeling strategies for different labeling tasks and task complexities, and (3) shed light on the effect of using different visual encodings to guide the visual-interactive labeling process. We further compare labeling of single versus multiple instances at a time, and quantify the impact on efficiency. We systematically compare the performance of visual interactive labeling with that of active learning. Our main findings are that visual-interactive labeling can outperform active learning, given the condition that dimension reduction separates well the class distributions. Moreover, using dimension reduction in combination with additional visual encodings that expose the internal state of the learning model turns out to improve the performance of visual-interactive labeling.","article_number":"8019851","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8019851","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019851/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019851/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"298","end_page":"308","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Labeling","Visual analytics","Data models","Uncertainty","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Labeling","Visual-Interactive Labeling","Information Visualization","Visual Analytics","Active Learning","Machine Learning","Classification","Evaluation","Experiment","Dimensionality Reduction"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2745919","title":"Revisiting Stress Majorization as a Unified Framework for Interactive Constrained Graph Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":11,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Shandong University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085804605","id":37085804605,"full_name":"Yunhai Wang","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Shandong University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086261704","id":37086261704,"full_name":"Yanyan Wang","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Shandong University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086249398","id":37086249398,"full_name":"Yinqi Sun","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Southeast University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086246211","id":37086246211,"full_name":"Lifeng Zhu","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"Shandong University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086253868","id":37086253868,"full_name":"Kecheng Lu","author_order":5},{"affiliation":"VRHIT SIATChinese University of Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086260865","id":37086260865,"full_name":"Chi-Wing Fu","author_order":6},{"affiliation":"University of Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590945600","id":37590945600,"full_name":"Michael Sedlmair","author_order":7},{"affiliation":"Konstanz University, VCC SIAT, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266781000","id":37266781000,"full_name":"Oliver Deussen","author_order":8},{"affiliation":"Shandong University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37600013700","id":37600013700,"full_name":"Baoquan Chen","author_order":9}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present an improved stress majorization method that incorporates various constraints, including directional constraints without the necessity of solving a constraint optimization problem.

Goals of team sport analysis regularly include identification of weaknesses of opposing teams, or assessing performance and improvement potential of a coached team. Current analysis workflows are typically based on the analysis of team videos. Also, analysts can rely on techniques from Information Visualization, to depict e.g., player or ball trajectories. However, video analysis is typically a time-consuming process, where the analyst needs to memorize and annotate scenes. In contrast, visualization typically relies on an abstract data model, often using abstract visual mappings, and is not directly linked to the observed movement context anymore. We propose a visual analytics system that tightly integrates team sport video recordings with abstract visualization of underlying trajectory data. We apply appropriate computer vision techniques to extract trajectory data from video input. Furthermore, we apply advanced trajectory and movement analysis techniques to derive relevant team sport analytic measures for region, event and player analysis in the case of soccer analysis. Our system seamlessly integrates video and visualization modalities, enabling analysts to draw on the advantages of both analysis forms. Several expert studies conducted with team sport analysts indicate the effectiveness of our integrated approach.","article_number":"8019849","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8019849","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019849/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019849/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"13","end_page":"22","citing_paper_count":13,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Trajectory","Visualization","Feature extraction","Video recording","Image color analysis","Computer vision"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["visual analytics","sport analytics","immersive analytics"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2744099","title":"Uncertainty Visualization Using Copula-Based Analysis in Mixed Distribution Models","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":13,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and EngineeringGRAVITY research groupThe Ohio State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085738698","id":37085738698,"full_name":"Subhashis Hazarika","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077194500","id":37077194500,"full_name":"Ayan Biswas","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and EngineeringGRAVITY research groupThe Ohio State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279493500","id":37279493500,"full_name":"Han-Wei Shen","author_order":3}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Distributions are often used to model uncertainty in many scientific datasets. To preserve the correlation among the spatially sampled grid locations in the dataset, various standard multivariate distribution models have been proposed in visualization literature. These models treat each grid location as a univariate random variable which models the uncertainty at that location. Standard multivariate distributions (both parametric and nonparametric) assume that all the univariate marginals are of the same type/family of distribution. But in reality, different grid locations show different statistical behavior which may not be modeled best by the same type of distribution. In this paper, we propose a new multivariate uncertainty modeling strategy to address the needs of uncertainty modeling in scientific datasets. Our proposed method is based on a statistically sound multivariate technique called Copula, which makes it possible to separate the process of estimating the univariate marginals and the process of modeling dependency, unlike the standard multivariate distributions. The modeling flexibility offered by our proposed method makes it possible to design distribution fields which can have different types of distribution (Gaussian, Histogram, KDE etc.) at the grid locations, while maintaining the correlation structure at the same time. Depending on the results of various standard statistical tests, we can choose an optimal distribution representation at each location, resulting in a more cost efficient modeling without significantly sacrificing on the analysis quality. To demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed modeling strategy, we extract and visualize uncertain features like isocontours and vortices in various real world datasets. We also study various modeling criterion to help users in the task of univariate model selection.","article_number":"8017601","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8017601","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017601/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017601/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"934","end_page":"943","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Computational modeling","Uncertainty","Analytical models","Feature extraction","Correlation","Data models","Standards"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty visualization","probability distribution","probabilistic feature","statistical modeling","copula"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2745138","title":"Conceptual and Methodological Issues in Evaluating Multidimensional Visualizations for Decision Support","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":14,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Inria, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085898406","id":37085898406,"full_name":"Evanthia Dimara","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Univ.

Our method consists in first giving participants low-level analytic tasks, in order to ensure that they properly understood the visualizations and their interactions. Participants are then given multi-attribute choice tasks consisting of choosing holiday packages. We assess decision support through multiple objective and subjective metrics, including a decision accuracy metric based on the consistency between the choice made and self-reported preferences for attributes. We found the three visualizations to be comparable on most metrics, with a slight advantage for tabular visualizations. In particular, tabular visualizations allow participants to reach decisions faster. Thus, although decision time is typically not central in assessing decision support, it can be used as a tie-breaker when visualizations achieve similar decision accuracy. Our results also suggest that indirect methods for assessing choice confidence may allow to better distinguish between visualizations than direct ones. We finally discuss the limitations of our methods and directions for future work, such as the need for more sensitive metrics of decision support.","article_number":"8019855","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8019855","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019855/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019855/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"749","end_page":"759","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Decision making","Measurement","Tools","Visualization","Employment"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["decision making","multidimensional visualization","parallel coordinates","scatterplot matrix","tabular visualization","evaluation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2743918","title":"Assessing the Graphical Perception of Time and Speed on 2D+Time Trajectories","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":15,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"City, University of LondonUniversity of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077505300","id":37077505300,"full_name":"Charles Perin","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086223881","id":37086223881,"full_name":"Tiffany Wun","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546710800","id":37546710800,"full_name":"Richard Pusch","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37285000100","id":37285000100,"full_name":"Sheelagh Carpendale","author_order":4}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We empirically evaluate the extent to which people perceive non-constant time and speed encoded on 2D paths.

The simulated atoms are usually visualized as hard spheres with Phong shading, where individual particles and their local density can be perceived well in close-up views. However, for large-scale simulations with 10 million particles or more, the visualization of large fields-of-view usually suffers from strong aliasing artifacts, because the mismatch between data size and output resolution leads to severe under-sampling of the geometry. Excessive super-sampling can alleviate this problem, but is prohibitively expensive. This paper presents a novel visualization method for large-scale particle data that addresses aliasing while enabling interactive high-quality rendering. We introduce the novel concept of screen-space normal distribution functions (S-NDFs) for particle data. S-NDFs represent the distribution of surface normals that map to a given pixel in screen space, which enables high-quality re-lighting without re-rendering particles. In order to facilitate interactive zooming, we cache S-NDFs in a screen-space mipmap (S-MIP).

Multi-attribute ranking systems are a common tool used to make these data-driven decisions. Such systems often take the form of a table-based visualization in which users assign weights to the attributes representing the quantifiable importance of each attribute to a decision, which the system then uses to compute a ranking of the data. However, these systems assume that users are able to quantify their conceptual understanding of how important particular attributes are to a decision. This is not always easy or even possible for users to do. Rather, people often have a more holistic understanding of the data. They form opinions that data point A is better than data point B but do not necessarily know which attributes are important. To address these challenges, we present a visual analytic application to help people rank multi-variate data points. We developed a prototype system, Podium, that allows users to drag rows in the table to rank order data points based on their perception of the relative value of the data. Podium then infers a weighting model using Ranking SVM that satisfies the user's data preferences as closely as possible. Whereas past systems help users understand the relationships between data points based on changes to attribute weights, our approach helps users to understand the attributes that might inform their understanding of the data. We present two usage scenarios to describe some of the potential uses of our proposed technique: (1) understanding which attributes contribute to a user's subjective preferences for data, and (2) deconstructing attributes of importance for existing rankings. Our proposed approach makes powerful machine learning techniques more usable to those who may not have expertise in these areas.","article_number":"8019863","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8019863","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019863/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019863/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"288","end_page":"297","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Support vector machines","Visual analytics","Data models","Prototypes","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Mixed-initiative visual analytics","multi-attribute ranking","user interaction"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2744298","title":"Blinded with Science or Informed by Charts?

Mass cytometry creates a high-dimensional description vector for single cells by time-of-flight measurement. Recently, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighborhood Embedding (t-SNE) has emerged as one of the state-of-the-art techniques for the visualization and exploration of single-cell data. Ever increasing amounts of data lead to the adoption of Hierarchical Stochastic Neighborhood Embedding (HSNE), enabling the hierarchical representation of the data. Here, the hierarchy is explored selectively by the analyst, who can request more and more detail in areas of interest. Such hierarchies are usually explored by visualizing disconnected plots of selections in different levels of the hierarchy. This poses problems for navigation, by imposing a high cognitive load on the analyst. In this work, we present an interactive summary-visualization to tackle this problem. CyteGuide guides the analyst through the exploration of hierarchically represented single-cell data, and provides a complete overview of the current state of the analysis. We conducted a two-phase user study with domain experts that use HSNE for data exploration.

For example, a viewer's ability to rapidly and accurately discern between two or more categorical variables in a chart or figure is contingent upon the distinctiveness of the encodings applied to each variable. Research in perception suggests that color is a more salient visual feature when compared to shape and although that finding is supported by visualization studies, characteristics of shape also yield meaningful differences in distinctiveness. We propose that open or closed shapes (that is, whether shapes are composed of line segments that are bounded across a region of space or not) represent a salient characteristic that influences perceptual processing. Three experiments were performed to test the reliability of the open/closed category; the first two from the perspective of attentional allocation, and the third experiment in the context of multi-class scatterplot displays. In the first, a flanker paradigm was used to test whether perceptual load and open/closed feature category would modulate the effect of the flanker on target processing. Results showed an influence of both variables. The second experiment used a Same/Different reaction time task to replicate and extend those findings. Results from both show that responses are faster and more accurate when closed rather than open shapes are processed as targets, and there is more processing interference when two competing shapes come from the same rather than different open or closed feature categories. The third experiment employed three commonly used visual analytic tasks - perception of average value, numerosity, and linear relationships with both single and dual displays of open and closed symbols. Our findings show that for numerosity and trend judgments, in particular, that different symbols from the same open or closed feature category cause more perceptual interference when they are presented together in a plot than symbols from different categories. Moreover, the extent of the interference appears to depend upon whether the participant is focused on processing open or closed symbols.","article_number":"8019826","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8019826","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019826/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019826/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"574","end_page":"583","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Shape","Encoding","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Visual perception","Interference"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["scatterplot","visualization design","perceptual category","open shape","closed shape"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2743998","title":"Structuring Visualization Mock-Ups at the Graphical Level by Dividing the Display Space","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":27,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"LIRIS, Univ Lyon, École Centrale de Lyon, CNRS, UMR5205, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681739300","id":37681739300,"full_name":"Romain Vuillemot","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"UN Global Pulse","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085379303","id":37085379303,"full_name":"Jeremy Boy","author_order":2}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Mock-ups are rapid, low fidelity prototypes, that are used in many design-related fields to generate and share ideas.

Our approach consists in iteratively subdividing the display space, while progressively informing each division with realistic data. We show that a wealth of mock-ups can easily be created using only temporary data attributes, as we wait for more realistic data to become available.

We found that social information that exhibits a high degree of consensus lead participants to recall the data more accurately relative to participants who were exposed to the data alone. Additionally, participants trusted the accuracy of the data less and were more likely to maintain their initial expectations when other people's expectations aligned with their own initial expectations but not with the data.

As part of our framework, we contribute concepts that enable users to interact with coordinated & multiple views (CMV) that are distributed across several mobile devices. The major components of the framework are: (i) dynamic and flexible layouts for CMV focusing on the distribution of views and (ii) an interaction concept for smart adaptations and combinations of visualizations utilizing explicit side-by-side arrangements of devices. As a result, users can benefit from the possibility to combine devices and organize them in meaningful spatial layouts. Furthermore, we present a web-based prototype implementation as a specific instance of our concepts. This implementation provides a practical application case enabling users to explore a multivariate data collection. We also illustrate the design process including feedback from a preliminary user study, which informed the design of both the concepts and the final prototype.","article_number":"8017609","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8017609","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017609/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017609/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"626","end_page":"636","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Mobile communication","Prototypes","Smart phones","Collaboration"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Mobile devices","coordinated & multiple views","multi-display environment","cross-device interaction"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2743959","title":"Bubble Treemaps for Uncertainty Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":30,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086226996","id":37086226996,"full_name":"Jochen Görtler","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"VISUSUniversity of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085884246","id":37085884246,"full_name":"Christoph Schulz","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"VISUSUniversity of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268045000","id":37268045000,"full_name":"Daniel Weiskopf","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266781000","id":37266781000,"full_name":"Oliver Deussen","author_order":4}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present a novel type of circular treemap, where we intentionally allocate extra space for additional visual variables.

While the output of biclustering techniques can offer some initial low-level insights, visual approaches are required on top of that due to the algorithmic output complexity. This paper proposes a visualization technique, called BiDots, that allows analysts to interactively explore biclusters over multiple domains. BiDots overcomes several limitations of existing bicluster visualizations by encoding biclusters in a more compact and cluster-driven manner. A set of handy interactions is incorporated to support flexible analysis of biclustering results. More importantly, BiDots addresses the cases of weighted biclusters, which has been underexploited in the literature. The design of BiDots is grounded by a set of analytical tasks derived from previous work. We demonstrate its usefulness and effectiveness for exploring computed biclusters with an investigative document analysis task, in which suspicious people and activities are identified from a text corpus.","article_number":"8017581","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8017581","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017581/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017581/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"195","end_page":"204","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Algorithm design and analysis","Organizations","Data mining","Sparse matrices","Data visualization","Gene expression"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Biclustering","coordinated relationship analysis","visual analytics"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2745139","title":"A Utility-Aware Visual Approach for Anonymizing Multi-Attribute Tabular Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":33,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086258030","id":37086258030,"full_name":"Xumeng Wang","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085795830","id":37085795830,"full_name":"Jia-Kai Chou","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37291847800","id":37291847800,"full_name":"Wei Chen","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085875789","id":37085875789,"full_name":"Huihua Guan","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086249532","id":37086249532,"full_name":"Wenlong Chen","author_order":5},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085874678","id":37085874678,"full_name":"Tianyi Lao","author_order":6},{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085432740","id":37085432740,"full_name":"Kwan-Liu Ma","author_order":7}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Sharing data for public usage requires sanitization to prevent sensitive information from leaking.

The traditional workflow is to exactly model the problem and then enter this model into a general-purpose “black-box” solver. In practice, however, many problems cannot be solved completely automatically, but require a “human-in-the-loop” to iteratively refine the model and give hints to the solver. In this paper, we explore the parallels between this interactive optimisation workflow and the visual analytics sense-making loop. We assert that interactive optimisation is essentially a visual analytics task and propose a problem-solving loop analogous to the sense-making loop. We explore these ideas through an in-depth analysis of a use-case in prostate brachytherapy, an application where interactive optimisation may be able to provide significant assistance to practitioners in creating prostate cancer treatment plans customised to each patient's tumour characteristics. However, current brachytherapy treatment planning is usually a careful, mostly manual process involving multiple professionals. We developed a prototype interactive optimisation tool for brachytherapy that goes beyond current practice in supporting focal therapy - targeting tumour cells directly rather than simply seeking coverage of the whole prostate gland. We conducted semi-structured interviews, in two stages, with seven radiation oncology professionals in order to establish whether they would prefer to use interactive optimisation for treatment planning and whether such a tool could improve their trust in the novel focal therapy approach and in machine generated solutions to the problem.","article_number":"8017652","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8017652","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017652/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017652/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"319","end_page":"329","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Optimization","Tools","Visual analytics","Mathematical model","Brachytherapy","Planning"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","interactive optimisation","interactive systems and tools","prostate brachytherapy"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2744898","title":"VIGOR: Interactive Visual Exploration of Graph Query Results","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":35,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085444131","id":37085444131,"full_name":"Robert Pienta","author_order":1},{"authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086235240","id":37086235240,"full_name":"Fred Hohman","author_order":2},{"authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681759500","id":37681759500,"full_name":"Alex Endert","author_order":3},{"authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38244968500","id":38244968500,"full_name":"Acar Tamersoy","author_order":4},{"authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086243723","id":37086243723,"full_name":"Kevin Roundy","author_order":5},{"authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086243033","id":37086243033,"full_name":"Chris Gates","author_order":6},{"authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284924800","id":37284924800,"full_name":"Shamkant Navathe","author_order":7},{"authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38276339400","id":38276339400,"full_name":"Duen Horng Chau","author_order":8}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Finding patterns in graphs has become a vital challenge in many domains from biological systems, network security, to finance (e.g., finding money laundering rings of bankers and business owners). While there is significant interest in graph databases and querying techniques, less research has focused on helping analysts make sense of underlying patterns within a group of subgraph results. Visualizing graph query results is challenging, requiring effective summarization of a large number of subgraphs, each having potentially shared node-values, rich node features, and flexible structure across queries. We present VIGOR, a novel interactive visual analytics system, for exploring and making sense of query results. VIGOR uses multiple coordinated views, leveraging different data representations and organizations to streamline analysts sensemaking process. VIGOR contributes: (1) an exemplar-based interaction technique, where an analyst starts with a specific result and relaxes constraints to find other similar results or starts with only the structure (i.e., without node value constraints), and adds constraints to narrow in on specific results; and (2) a novel feature-aware subgraph result summarization. Through a collaboration with Symantec, we demonstrate how VIGOR helps tackle real-world problems through the discovery of security blindspots in a cybersecurity dataset with over 11,000 incidents. We also evaluate VIGOR with a within-subjects study, demonstrating VIGOR's ease of use over a leading graph database management system, and its ability to help analysts understand their results at higher speed and make fewer errors.","article_number":"8019832","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8019832","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019832/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019832/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"215","end_page":"225","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Logic gates","Computer security","Database systems","Data mining","Visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["graph querying","subgraph results","query result visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2744319","title":"Bridging from Goals to Tasks with Design Study Analysis Reports","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":36,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Tableau Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086237972","id":37086237972,"full_name":"Heidi Lam","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Tableau Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275861300","id":37275861300,"full_name":"Melanie Tory","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"University of British Columbia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349490300","id":37349490300,"full_name":"Tamara Munzner","author_order":3}]},"access_type":"OPEN_ACCESS","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Visualization researchers and practitioners engaged in generating or evaluating designs are faced with the difficult problem of transforming the questions asked and actions taken by target users from domain-specific language and context into more abstract forms. Existing abstract task classifications aim to provide support for this endeavour by providing a carefully delineated suite of actions. Our experience is that this bottom-up approach is part of the challenge: low-level actions are difficult to interpret without a higher-level context of analysis goals and the analysis process. To bridge this gap, we propose a framework based on analysis reports derived from open-coding 20 design study papers published at IEEE InfoVis 2009-2015, to build on the previous work of abstractions that collectively encompass a broad variety of domains. The framework is organized in two axes illustrated by nine analysis goals. It helps situate the analysis goals by placing each goal under axes of specificity (Explore, Describe, Explain, Confirm) and number of data populations (Single, Multiple). The single-population types are Discover Observation, Describe Observation, Identify Main Cause, and Collect Evidence.

A plethora of visual-interactive cluster analysis techniques has been proposed to date, however, arriving at useful clusterings often requires several rounds of user interactions to fine-tune the data preprocessing and algorithms. We present a multi-stage Visual Analytics (VA) approach for iterative cluster refinement together with an implementation (SOMFlow) that uses Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) to analyze time series data. It supports exploration by offering the analyst a visual platform to analyze intermediate results, adapt the underlying computations, iteratively partition the data, and to reflect previous analytical activities. The history of previous decisions is explicitly visualized within a flow graph, allowing to compare earlier cluster refinements and to explore relations. We further leverage quality and interestingness measures to guide the analyst in the discovery of useful patterns, relations, and data partitions. We conducted two pair analytics experiments together with a subject matter expert in speech intonation research to demonstrate that the approach is effective for interactive data analysis, supporting enhanced understanding of clustering results as well as the interactive process itself.","article_number":"8019867","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8019867","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019867/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019867/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"120","end_page":"130","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Time series analysis","Clustering algorithms","Self-organizing feature maps","Algorithm design and analysis","Speech"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analytics","Interaction","Visual Cluster Analysis","Quality Metrics","Guidance","Self-Organizing Maps","Time Series"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2744199","title":"Considerations for Visualizing Comparison","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":38,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Wisconsin-Madison","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282585700","id":37282585700,"full_name":"Michael Gleicher","author_order":1}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Supporting comparison is a common and diverse challenge in visualization. Such support is difficult to design because solutions must address both the specifics of their scenario as well as the general issues of comparison. This paper aids designers by providing a strategy for considering those general issues. It presents four considerations that abstract comparison. These considerations identify issues and categorize solutions in a domain independent manner. The first considers how the common elements of comparison-a target set of items that are related and an action the user wants to perform on that relationship-are present in an analysis problem. The second considers why these elements lead to challenges because of their scale, in number of items, complexity of items, or complexity of relationship. The third considers what strategies address the identified scaling challenges, grouping solutions into three broad categories. The fourth considers which visual designs map to these strategies to provide solutions for a comparison analysis problem. In sequence, these considerations provide a process for developers to consider support for comparison in the design of visualization tools. Case studies show how these considerations can help in the design and evaluation of visualization solutions for comparison problems.","article_number":"8017615","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8017615","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017615/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017615/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"413","end_page":"423","citing_paper_count":27,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Tools","Data visualization","Electronic mail","Complexity theory","Encoding"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Information Visualization","Comparison","Taxonomies","Visualization Models","Task Analysis"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2743958","title":"Globe Browsing: Contextualized Spatio-Temporal Planetary Surface Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":39,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Linköping University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086238535","id":37086238535,"full_name":"Karl Bladin","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Linköping University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399690600","id":37399690600,"full_name":"Emil Axelsson","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Linköping University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086236897","id":37086236897,"full_name":"Erik Broberg","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"American Museum of Natural History","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085747250","id":37085747250,"full_name":"Carter Emmart","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"Linköping University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284208400","id":37284208400,"full_name":"Patric Ljung","author_order":5},{"affiliation":"New York UniversityLinköping University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489536800","id":38489536800,"full_name":"Alexander Bock","author_order":6},{"affiliation":"Linköping University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284192000","id":37284192000,"full_name":"Anders Ynnerman","author_order":7}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Results of planetary mapping are often shared openly for use in scientific research and mission planning.

As our approach handles dynamic data sources, streamed from online repositories, we are significantly shortening the time between discovery and dissemination of data and results. We describe the image acquisition pipeline, the pre-processing steps to derive a 2.5D terrain, and a chunked level-of-detail, out-of-core rendering approach to enable interactive exploration of global maps and high-resolution digital terrain models. The results are demonstrated for three different celestial bodies. The first case addresses high-resolution map data on the surface of Mars. A second case is showing dynamic processes, such as concurrent weather conditions on Earth that require temporal datasets. As a final example we use data from the New Horizons spacecraft which acquired images during a single flyby of Pluto. We visualize the acquisition process as well as the resulting surface data.

Based on the above, we propose a two-fold contribution: First, we use cluster centroids to design a new bundling method for 2D and 3D curve-sets. Secondly, we deform the cluster centroids and generate new curves along them, which enables us to modify the underlying data in a statistically-controlled way via its simplified (bundled) view. We demonstrate our method by applications on real-world 2D and 3D datasets for graph bundling, trajectory analysis, and vector field and tensor field visualization.","article_number":"8017623","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8017623","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017623/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017623/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"500","end_page":"510","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Shape","Data models","Two dimensional displays","Three-dimensional displays","Data visualization","Splines (mathematics)","Clutter"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["path visualization","trajectory visualization","edge bundles","functional decomposition","path generation","streamlines"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2745978","title":"HiPiler: Visual Exploration of Large Genome Interaction Matrices with Interactive Small Multiples","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":46,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Harvard University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086215204","id":37086215204,"full_name":"Fritz Lekschas","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Harvard University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085687578","id":37085687578,"full_name":"Benjamin Bach","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Harvard Medical School","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086224967","id":37086224967,"full_name":"Peter Kerpedjiev","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Harvard Medical School","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37972937500","id":37972937500,"full_name":"Nils Gehlenborg","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"Harvard University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275698100","id":37275698100,"full_name":"Hanspeter Pfister","author_order":5}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"This paper presents an interactive visualization interface-HiPiler-for the exploration and visualization of regions-of-interest in large genome interaction matrices. Genome interaction matrices approximate the physical distance of pairs of regions on the genome to each other and can contain up to 3 million rows and columns with many sparse regions. Regions of interest (ROIs) can be defined, e.g., by sets of adjacent rows and columns, or by specific visual patterns in the matrix. However, traditional matrix aggregation or pan-and-zoom interfaces fail in supporting search, inspection, and comparison of ROIs in such large matrices. In HiPiler, ROIs are first-class objects, represented as thumbnail-like “snippets”. Snippets can be interactively explored and grouped or laid out automatically in scatterplots, or through dimension reduction methods. Snippets are linked to the entire navigable genome interaction matrix through brushing and linking. The design of HiPiler is based on a series of semi-structured interviews with 10 domain experts involved in the analysis and interpretation of genome interaction matrices. We describe six exploration tasks that are crucial for analysis of interaction matrices and demonstrate how HiPiler supports these tasks. We report on a user study with a series of data exploration sessions with domain experts to assess the usability of HiPiler as well as to demonstrate respective findings in the data.","article_number":"8017587","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8017587","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017587/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017587/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"522","end_page":"531","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Bioinformatics","Genomics","Algorithm design and analysis","Interviews","Visualization","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Interactive Small Multiples","Matrix Comparison","Biomedical Visualization","Genomics"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2744685","title":"Visualizing Big Data Outliers Through Distributed Aggregation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":47,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"H2O.aiUIC","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37560536200","id":37560536200,"full_name":"Leland Wilkinson","author_order":1}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Visualizing outliers in massive datasets requires statistical pre-processing in order to reduce the scale of the problem to a size amenable to rendering systems like D3, Plotly or analytic systems like R or SAS.

These data often contain many fine and intricate structures, which pose huge challenges for volume rendering, and make it particularly important to efficiently skip empty space. This paper addresses two major challenges: (1) The complexity of large volumes containing fine structures often leads to highly fragmented space subdivisions that make empty regions hard to skip efficiently. (2) The classification of space into empty and non-empty regions changes frequently, because the user or the evaluation of an interactive query activate a different set of objects, which makes it unfeasible to pre-compute a well-adapted space subdivision. We describe the novel SparseLeap method for efficient empty space skipping in very large volumes, even around fine structures. The main performance characteristic of SparseLeap is that it moves the major cost of empty space skipping out of the ray-casting stage. We achieve this via a hybrid strategy that balances the computational load between determining empty ray segments in a rasterization (object-order) stage, and sampling non-empty volume data in the ray-casting (image-order) stage. Before ray-casting, we exploit the fast hardware rasterization of GPUs to create a ray segment list for each pixel, which identifies non-empty regions along the ray. The ray-casting stage then leaps over empty space without hierarchy traversal. Ray segment lists are created by rasterizing a set of fine-grained, view-independent bounding boxes. Frame coherence is exploited by re-using the same bounding boxes unless the set of active objects changes. We show that SparseLeap scales better to large, sparse data than standard octree empty space skipping.","article_number":"8017589","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8017589","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017589/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017589/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"974","end_page":"983","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Octrees","Graphics processing units","Geometry","Image segmentation","Standards","Histograms"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Empty Space Skipping","Volume Rendering","Segmented Volume Data","Hybrid Image/Object-Order Approaches"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2745280","title":"Dynamic Influence Networks for Rule-Based Models","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":49,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of California, Santa Cruz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38180697500","id":38180697500,"full_name":"Angus G.

A blue-noise polyline sampling scheme is then introduced to select time series samples, which can both preserve outliers and reduce visual clutter. To further investigate the root cause of a failed training process, we propose a credit assignment algorithm that indicates how other neurons contribute to the output of the neuron causing the training failure.

While topological data analysis has gained in popularity over the last two decades, it has not yet been widely adopted as a standard data analysis tool for end users or developers. TTK aims at addressing this problem by providing a unified, generic, efficient, and robust implementation of key algorithms for the topological analysis of scalar data, including: critical points, integral lines, persistence diagrams, persistence curves, merge trees, contour trees, Morse-Smale complexes, fiber surfaces, continuous scatterplots, Jacobi sets, Reeb spaces, and more. TTK is easily accessible to end users due to a tight integration with ParaView. It is also easily accessible to developers through a variety of bindings (Python, VTK/C++) for fast prototyping or through direct, dependency-free, C++, to ease integration into pre-existing complex systems. While developing TTK, we faced several algorithmic and software engineering challenges, which we document in this paper. In particular, we present an algorithm for the construction of a discrete gradient that complies to the critical points extracted in the piecewise-linear setting. This algorithm guarantees a combinatorial consistency across the topological abstractions supported by TTK, and importantly, a unified implementation of topological data simplification for multi-scale exploration and analysis. We also present a cached triangulation data structure, that supports time efficient and generic traversals, which self-adjusts its memory usage on demand for input simplicial meshes and which implicitly emulates a triangulation for regular grids with no memory overhead. Finally, we describe an original software architecture, which guarantees memory efficient and direct accesses to TTK features, while still allowing for researchers powerful and easy bindings and extensions.

Through an iterative design study with social scientists and historians, we develop TreeEvo that assists users to generate and test empirical hypotheses for multi-generational research. TreeEvo summarizes and organizes family trees by structural features in a dynamic manner based on a traditional Sankey diagram. A pixel-based technique is further proposed to compactly encode trees with complex structures in each Sankey Node.

Such data is relevant for the geoscientific research field of landscape and climate development. It results from microscopic analysis of lake sediment cores. The goal is to gain hypotheses about landscape evolution and climate conditions in the past. To this end, geoscientists identify which categorical sequences are similar in the sense that they indicate similar conditions. Categorical sequences are similar if they have similar meaning (semantic similarity) and appear in similar time periods (temporal similarity). For data sets with many different categorical sequences, the task to identify similar sequences becomes a challenge. Our contribution is a tailored visual analysis concept that effectively supports the analytical process. Our visual interface comprises coupled visualizations of semantics and temporal context for the exploration and assessment of the similarity of categorical sequences. Integrated automatic methods reduce the analytical effort substantially. They (1) extract unique sequences in the data and (2) rank sequences by a similarity measure during the search for similar sequences. We evaluated our concept by demonstrations of our prototype to a larger audience and hands-on analysis sessions for two different lakes. According to geoscientists, our approach fills an important methodological gap in the application domain.","article_number":"8022969","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8022969","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8022969/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8022969/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"66","end_page":"76","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Meteorology","Semantics","Sediments","Visualization","Lakes","Microscopy","Prototypes"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization in Earth Science","Time Series Data","Categorical Data","Design Study"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2744758","title":"EVA: Visual Analytics to Identify Fraudulent Events","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":55,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Vienna University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086245311","id":37086245311,"full_name":"Roger A.

Given a certain degree of overlap between blocks, our method can balance the number of particles as much as possible.

Researchers across the fields of data science, visualization, and human-computer interaction are calling for foundational tools and principles that could be applied to assessing the effectiveness of data visualizations in a more rapid and generalizable manner. One possibility for such a tool is a model of visual saliency for data visualizations. Visual saliency models are typically based on the properties of the human visual cortex and predict which areas of a scene have visual features (e.g. color, luminance, edges) that are likely to draw a viewer's attention. While these models can accurately predict where viewers will look in a natural scene, they typically do not perform well for abstract data visualizations. In this paper, we discuss the reasons for the poor performance of existing saliency models when applied to data visualizations. We introduce the Data Visualization Saliency (DVS) model, a saliency model tailored to address some of these weaknesses, and we test the performance of the DVS model and existing saliency models by comparing the saliency maps produced by the models to eye tracking data obtained from human viewers. Finally, we describe how modified saliency models could be used as general tools for assessing the effectiveness of visualizations, including the strengths and weaknesses of this approach.","article_number":"8017597","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8017597","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017597/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017597/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"563","end_page":"573","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Measurement","Data models","Brain modeling","Predictive models","Tools"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual saliency","evaluation","eye tracking"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2744218","title":"iTTVis: Interactive Visualization of Table Tennis Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":58,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD & CGZhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","id":37407308300,"full_name":"Yingcai Wu","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD & CGZhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086238864","id":37086238864,"full_name":"Ji Lan","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD & CGZhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086245904","id":37086245904,"full_name":"Xinhuan Shu","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD & CGZhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086239315","id":37086239315,"full_name":"Chenyang Ji","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD & CGZhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086242254","id":37086242254,"full_name":"Kejian Zhao","author_order":5},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD & CGZhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086242334","id":37086242334,"full_name":"Jiachen Wang","author_order":6},{"affiliation":"Department of Physical EducationCollege of EducationZhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086236404","id":37086236404,"full_name":"Hui Zhang","author_order":7}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The rapid development of information technology paved the way for the recording of fine-grained data, such as stroke techniques and stroke placements, during a table tennis match.

Analysts usually employ tedious and cumbersome methods which are limited to watching videos and reading statistical tables.

The proposed system with several well-coordinated views not only supports correlation identification through statistics and pattern detection of tactics with a score timeline but also allows cross analysis to gain insights.

In this paper, we propose a novel visualization technique based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle to construct a coarse-level overview of event sequence data while balancing the information loss in it. The method addresses a fundamental trade-off in visualization design: reducing visual clutter vs. increasing the information content in a visualization. The method enables simultaneous sequence clustering and pattern extraction and is highly tolerant to noises such as missing or additional events in the data. Based on this approach we propose a visual analytics framework with multiple levels-of-detail to facilitate interactive data exploration. We demonstrate the usability and effectiveness of our approach through case studies with two real-world datasets. One dataset showcases a new application domain for event sequence visualization, i.e., fault development path analysis in vehicles for predictive maintenance.

Illustrations are typically non-interactive, and when an illustration is updated, it still has to reach the user. Our system is designed to overcome these three obstacles. It supports the integration of heterogeneous datasets, reflecting the knowledge that is gained from different data sources in biology. After pre-processing the datasets, the system transforms them into visual representations as inspired by scientific illustrations. As opposed to traditional scientific illustration these representations are generated in real-time - they are interactive. The code generating the visualizations can be embedded in various software environments. To demonstrate this, we implemented both a desktop application and a remote-rendering server in which the pipeline is embedded. The remote-rendering server supports multi-threaded rendering and it is able to handle multiple users simultaneously.

Building upon these three organizations, we connect data characteristics, analysis tasks, and design choices in order to generate challenges, open questions, and example best practices for the effective design of scatterplots.","article_number":"8017602","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8017602","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017602/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017602/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"402","end_page":"412","citing_paper_count":17,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Taxonomy","Correlation","Complexity theory","Organizations","Visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Scatterplots","task taxonomies","study of designs"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2746018","title":"Taking Word Clouds Apart: An Empirical Investigation of the Design Space for Keyword Summaries","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":63,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085892057","id":37085892057,"full_name":"Cristian Felix","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077249100","id":37077249100,"full_name":"Steven Franconeri","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38267713800","id":38267713800,"full_name":"Enrico Bertini","author_order":3}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this paper we present a set of four user studies aimed at exploring the visual design space of what we call keyword summaries: lists of words with associated quantitative values used to help people derive an intuition of what information a given document collection (or part of it) may contain.

Topic models enable one to mine cross-sectional patient comorbidity data (e.g., electronic health records) and construct disease subtypes-each with its own temporally evolving prevalence and co-occurrence of phenotypes-without requiring aligned longitudinal phenotype data for all patients. However, the dimensionality of topic models makes interpretation challenging, and de facto analyses provide little intuition regarding phenotype relevance or phenotype interrelationships. PhenoLines enables one to compare phenotype prevalence within and across disease subtype topics, thus supporting subtype characterization, a task that involves identifying a proposed subtype's dominant phenotypes, ages of effect, and clinical validity. We contribute a data transformation workflow that employs the Human Phenotype Ontology to hierarchically organize phenotypes and aggregate the evolving probabilities produced by topic models. We introduce a novel measure of phenotype relevance that can be used to simplify the resulting topology. The design of PhenoLines was motivated by formative interviews with machine learning and clinical experts. We describe the collaborative design process, distill high-level tasks, and report on initial evaluations with machine learning experts and a medical domain expert. These results suggest that PhenoLines demonstrates promising approaches to support the characterization and optimization of topic models.","article_number":"8019821","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8019821","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019821/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019821/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"371","end_page":"381","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Diseases","Data models","Visualization","Biological system modeling","Analytical models","Data visualization","Tools"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Developmental disorder","Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)","Phenotypes","Topic models","Topology simplification"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2744359","title":"Modeling Color Difference for Visualization Design","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":65,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Colorado","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085770068","id":37085770068,"full_name":"Danielle Albers Szafir","author_order":1}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Color is frequently used to encode values in visualizations.

These limitations may cause data misinterpretation in visualizations, which frequently use small, elongated marks. Our goal is to develop quantitative metrics to help people use color more effectively in visualizations. We present a series of crowdsourced studies measuring color difference perceptions for three common mark types: points, bars, and lines.

We hypothesize that truly multimodal interfaces for visualization, those providing users with freedom of expression via both natural language and touch-based direct manipulation input, may provide an effective and engaging user experience. Unfortunately, however, little work has been done in exploring such multimodal visualization interfaces. To address this gap, we have created an architecture and a prototype visualization system called Orko that facilitates both natural language and direct manipulation input. Specifically, Orko focuses on the domain of network visualization, one that has largely relied on WIMP-based interfaces and direct manipulation interaction, and has little or no prior research exploring natural language interaction. We report results from an initial evaluation study of Orko, and use our observations to discuss opportunities and challenges for future work in multimodal network visualization interfaces.","article_number":"8019860","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8019860","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019860/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019860/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"511","end_page":"521","citing_paper_count":16,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Natural languages","Visualization","Taxonomy","Prototypes","Mice","Speech"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Multimodal interaction","network visualization","natural language input","direct manipulation","multitouch input"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2743980","title":"TopoAngler: Interactive Topology-Based Extraction of Fishes","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":67,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489536800","id":38489536800,"full_name":"Alexander Bock","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38228713200","id":38228713200,"full_name":"Harish Doraiswamy","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086879505","id":37086879505,"full_name":"Adam Summers","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275249200","id":37275249200,"full_name":"Cláudio Silva","author_order":4}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present TopoAngler, a visualization framework that enables an interactive user-guided segmentation of fishes contained in a micro-CT scan.

In the first step, the join tree of the input is used to create a hierarchical segmentation of the volume. Through the use of linked views, the visual interface then allows users to interactively explore this hierarchy, and gather parts of individual fishes into a coherent sub-volume, thus reconstructing entire fishes. Our framework was primarily developed for its application to CT scans of fishes, generated as part of the ScanAllFish project, through close collaboration with their lead scientist.

Astrocytes are glial cells, i.e., non-neuronal cells that support neurons and the nervous system. The study of astrocytes has immense potential for understanding brain function. However, their complex and widely-branching structure requires high-resolution electron microscopy imaging and makes visualization and analysis challenging. Furthermore, the structure and function of astrocytes is very different from neurons, and therefore requires the development of new visualization and analysis tools. With Abstractocyte, biologists can explore the morphology of astrocytes using various visual abstraction levels, while simultaneously analyzing neighboring neurons and their connectivity. We define a novel, conceptual 2D abstraction space for jointly visualizing astrocytes and neurons. Neuroscientists can choose a specific joint visualization as a point in this space. Interactively moving this point allows them to smoothly transition between different abstraction levels in an intuitive manner. In contrast to simply switching between different visualizations, this preserves the visual context and correlations throughout the transition. Users can smoothly navigate from concrete, highly-detailed 3D views to simplified and abstracted 2D views. In addition to investigating astrocytes, neurons, and their relationships, we enable the interactive analysis of the distribution of glycogen, which is of high importance to neuroscientists. We describe the design of Abstractocyte, and present three case studies in which neuroscientists have successfully used our system to assess astrocytic coverage of synapses, glycogen distribution in relation to synapses, and astrocytic-mitochondria coverage.","article_number":"8017643","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8017643","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017643/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017643/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"853","end_page":"861","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Neurons","Data visualization","Visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Two dimensional displays","Tools","Nanoscale devices"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Connectomics","Neuroscience","Data Abstraction","Interactive 3D Visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2745958","title":"Active Reading of Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":70,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38016653500","id":38016653500,"full_name":"Jagoda Walny","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077910700","id":37077910700,"full_name":"Samuel Huron","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077505300","id":37077505300,"full_name":"Charles Perin","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086223881","id":37086223881,"full_name":"Tiffany Wun","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546710800","id":37546710800,"full_name":"Richard Pusch","author_order":5},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37285000100","id":37285000100,"full_name":"Sheelagh Carpendale","author_order":6}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We investigate whether the notion of active reading for text might be usefully applied to visualizations.

The framework and model are based on the activity-centered design paradigm, which is an enhancement of human-centered design. The proposed activity-centered approach focuses on user tasks and activities, and allows an explicit link between the requirements engineering process with the abstraction stage - and its evaluation - of existing, higher-level visualization design models. In a departure from existing visualization design models, the resulting model: assigns value to a visualization based on user activities; ranks user tasks before the user data; partitions requirements in activity-related capabilities and nonfunctional characteristics and constraints; and explicitly incorporates the user workflows into the requirements process. A further merit of this model is its explicit integration of functional specifications, a concept this work adapts from the software engineering literature, into the visualization design nested model. A quantitative evaluation using two sets of interdisciplinary projects supports the merits of the activity-centered model. The result is a practical roadmap to the domain characterization step of visualization design for problem-driven data visualization.

This yields a trial-and-error process to verify the appropriate model and parameters. This paper contributes an exploratory interface that supports visual identification of low-dimensional structures in a high-dimensional dataset, and facilitates the optimized selection of data models and configurations. Our key idea is to abstract a set of global and local feature descriptors from the neighborhood graph-based representation of the latent low-dimensional structure, such as pairwise geodesic distance (GD) among points and pairwise local tangent space divergence (LTSD) among pointwise local tangent spaces (LTS). We propose a new LTSD-GD view, which is constructed by mapping LTSD and GD to the $x$ axis and $y$ axis using 1D multidimensional scaling, respectively. Unlike traditional dimensionality reduction methods that preserve various kinds of distances among points, the LTSD-GD view presents the distribution of pointwise LTS ($x$ axis) and the variation of LTS in structures (the combination of $x$ axis and $y$ axis). We design and implement a suite of visual tools for navigating and reasoning about intrinsic structures of a high-dimensional dataset. Three case studies verify the effectiveness of our approach.","article_number":"8017645","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8017645","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017645/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017645/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"236","end_page":"245","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Manifolds","Data visualization","Data models","Visualization","Tools","Analytical models","Principal component analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["High-dimensional data","low-dimensional structure","subspace","manifold","visual exploration"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2745080","title":"Progressive Learning of Topic Modeling Parameters: A Visual Analytics Framework","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":73,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086235941","id":37086235941,"full_name":"Mennatallah El-Assady","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086240969","id":37086240969,"full_name":"Rita Sevastjanova","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086245203","id":37086245203,"full_name":"Fabian Sperrle","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","id":37283138700,"full_name":"Daniel Keim","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37669874100","id":37669874100,"full_name":"Christopher Collins","author_order":5}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Topic modeling algorithms are widely used to analyze the thematic composition of text corpora but remain difficult to interpret and adjust.

To gain insights into the relationship between words, the NLP community has begun to adapt high-dimensional visualization techniques. In particular, researchers commonly use t-distributed stochastic neighbor embeddings (t-SNE) and principal component analysis (PCA) to create two-dimensional embeddings for assessing the overall structure and exploring linear relationships (e.g., word analogies), respectively. Unfortunately, these techniques often produce mediocre or even misleading results and cannot address domain-specific visualization challenges that are crucial for understanding semantic relationships in word embeddings. Here, we introduce new embedding techniques for visualizing semantic and syntactic analogies, and the corresponding tests to determine whether the resulting views capture salient structures. Additionally, we introduce two novel views for a comprehensive study of analogy relationships. Finally, we augment t-SNE embeddings to convey uncertainty information in order to allow a reliable interpretation. Combined, the different views address a number of domain-specific tasks difficult to solve with existing tools.","article_number":"8019864","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8019864","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019864/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019864/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"553","end_page":"562","citing_paper_count":13,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Semantics","Principal component analysis","Visualization","Natural language processing","Tools","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Natural Language Processing","Word Embedding","High-Dimensional Data"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2745320","title":"EventThread: Visual Summarization and Stage Analysis of Event Sequence Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":76,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547434","id":37086547434,"full_name":"Shunan Guo","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086887730","id":37086887730,"full_name":"Ke Xu","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"iDVx LabTongji University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086889300","id":37086889300,"full_name":"Rongwen Zhao","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601397400","id":37601397400,"full_name":"David Gotz","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271683100","id":37271683100,"full_name":"Hongyuan Zha","author_order":5},{"affiliation":"iDVx LabTongji University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604309600","id":37604309600,"full_name":"Nan Cao","author_order":6}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Event sequence data such as electronic health records, a person's academic records, or car service records, are ordered series of events which have occurred over a period of time.

For example, event sequence analysis might reveal frequently used care plans for treating a disease, typical publishing patterns of professors, and the patterns of service that result in a well-maintained car. It is challenging, however, to visually explore large numbers of event sequences, or sequences with large numbers of event types. Existing methods focus on extracting explicitly matching patterns of events using statistical analysis to create stages of event progression over time. However, these methods fail to capture latent clusters of similar but not identical evolutions of event sequences. In this paper, we introduce a novel visualization system named EventThread which clusters event sequences into threads based on tensor analysis and visualizes the latent stage categories and evolution patterns by interactively grouping the threads by similarity into time-specific clusters.

Understanding the notion and mathematical properties of branched covering spaces is important to researchers in tensor field visualization and geometry processing, and their application areas. In this paper, we provide a framework to interactively design and visualize the branched covering space (BCS) of an input mesh surface and a rotational symmetry field defined on it. In our framework, the user can visualize not only the BCSs but also their construction process. In addition, our system allows the user to design the geometric realization of the BCS using mesh deformation techniques as well as connecting tubes. This enables the user to verify important facts about BCSs such as that they are manifold surfaces around singularities, as well as the Riemann-Hurwitz formula which relates the Euler characteristic of the BCS to that of the original mesh. Our system is evaluated by student researchers in scientific visualization and geometry processing as well as faculty members in mathematics at our university who teach topology.

Selecting a “good” layout method is thus important for visualizing a graph. The selection can be highly subjective and dependent on the given task. A common approach to selecting a good layout is to use aesthetic criteria and visual inspection. However, fully calculating various layouts and their associated aesthetic metrics is computationally expensive. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach to large graph visualization based on computing the topological similarity of graphs using graph kernels. For a given graph, our approach can show what the graph would look like in different layouts and estimate their corresponding aesthetic metrics. An important contribution of our work is the development of a new framework to design graph kernels. Our experimental study shows that our estimation calculation is considerably faster than computing the actual layouts and their aesthetic metrics. Also, our graph kernels outperform the state-of-the-art ones in both time and accuracy. In addition, we conducted a user study to demonstrate that the topological similarity computed with our graph kernel matches perceptual similarity assessed by human users.","article_number":"8017580","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8017580","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017580/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017580/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"478","end_page":"488","citing_paper_count":13,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Kernel","Layout","Measurement","Visualization","Inspection","Data visualization","Support vector machines"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Graph visualization","graph layout","aesthetics","machine learning","graph kernel","graphlet"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2744198","title":"Keeping Multiple Views Consistent: Constraints, Validations, and Exceptions in Visualization Authoring","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":79,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Washington","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086218547","id":37086218547,"full_name":"Zening Qu","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38016234500","id":38016234500,"full_name":"Jessica Hullman","author_order":2}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Visualizations often appear in multiples, either in a single display (e.g., small multiples, dashboard) or across time or space (e.g., slideshow, set of dashboards).

Moreover, little is known how consistency balances with other design considerations, making it difficult to incorporate consistency mechanisms in visualization authoring software. We present a wizard-of-oz study in which we observed how Tableau users achieve and sacrifice consistency in an exploration-to-presentation visualization design scenario. We extend (from our prior work) a set of encoding-specific constraints defining consistency across multiple views. Using the constraints as a checklist in our study, we observed cases where participants spontaneously maintained consistent encodings and warned cases where consistency was overlooked. In response to the warnings, participants either revised views for consistency or stated why they thought consistency should be overwritten. We categorize participants' actions and responses as constraint validations and exceptions, depicting the relative importance of consistency and other design considerations under various circumstances (e.g., data cardinality, available encoding resources, chart layout). We discuss automatic consistency checking as a constraint-satisfaction problem and provide design implications for communicating inconsistencies to users.","article_number":"8017651","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8017651","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017651/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017651/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"468","end_page":"477","citing_paper_count":21,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Encoding","Data visualization","Image color analysis","Visualization","Adaptation models","Color","Guidelines"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization Design","Qualitative Study","Evaluation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2745085","title":"Clustervision: Visual Supervision of Unsupervised Clustering","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":80,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"IBM T.J.

However, data can be clustered in many ways, and there exist a large body of algorithms designed to reveal different patterns. While having access to a wide variety of algorithms is helpful, in practice, it is quite difficult for data scientists to choose and parameterize algorithms to get the clustering results relevant for their dataset and analytical tasks. To alleviate this problem, we built Clustervision, a visual analytics tool that helps ensure data scientists find the right clustering among the large amount of techniques and parameters available. Our system clusters data using a variety of clustering techniques and parameters and then ranks clustering results utilizing five quality metrics. In addition, users can guide the system to produce more relevant results by providing task-relevant constraints on the data. Our visual user interface allows users to find high quality clustering results, explore the clusters using several coordinated visualization techniques, and select the cluster result that best suits their task. We demonstrate this novel approach using a case study with a team of researchers in the medical domain and showcase that our system empowers users to choose an effective representation of their complex data.","article_number":"8019866","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8019866","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019866/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019866/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"142","end_page":"151","citing_paper_count":17,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Clustering algorithms","Measurement","Visual analytics","Partitioning algorithms","Data visualization","Indexes"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Unsupervised Clustering","Visual Analytics","Quality Metrics","Interactive Visual Clustering"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2744479","title":"BASTet: Shareable and Reproducible Analysis and Visualization of Mass Spectrometry Imaging Data via OpenMSI","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":81,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computational Research DivisionLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38549423900","id":38549423900,"full_name":"Oliver Rübel","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Environmental Genomics & Systems Biology DivisionLBNL","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085673535","id":37085673535,"full_name":"Benjamin P.

While MSI data can be routinely collected, its broad application is currently limited by the lack of easily accessible analysis methods that can process data of the size, volume, diversity, and complexity generated by MSI experiments. The development and application of cutting-edge analytical methods is a core driver in MSI research for new scientific discoveries, medical diagnostics, and commercial-innovation. However, the lack of means to share, apply, and reproduce analyses hinders the broad application, validation, and use of novel MSI analysis methods. To address this central challenge, we introduce the Berkeley Analysis and Storage Toolkit (BASTet), a novel framework for shareable and reproducible data analysis that supports standardized data and analysis interfaces, integrated data storage, data provenance, workflow management, and a broad set of integrated tools. Based on BASTet, we describe the extension of the OpenMSI mass spectrometry imaging science gateway to enable web-based sharing, reuse, analysis, and visualization of data analyses and derived data products. We demonstrate the application of BASTet and OpenMSI in practice to identify and compare characteristic substructures in the mouse brain based on their chemical composition measured via MSI.","article_number":"8017614","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8017614","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017614/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017614/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"1025","end_page":"1035","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Imaging","Data analysis","Mass spectroscopy","Tools","Software","Ions"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Mass spectrometry imaging","Data provenance","Visualization","Data management","Analysis Workflows","Data sharing"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2744378","title":"Visual Diagnosis of Tree Boosting Methods","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":82,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Tsinghua University and National Engineering Lab for Big Data Software","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406039100","id":37406039100,"full_name":"Shixia Liu","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Tsinghua University and National Engineering Lab for Big Data Software","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086228278","id":37086228278,"full_name":"Jiannan Xiao","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Tsinghua University and National Engineering Lab for Big Data Software","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085883613","id":37085883613,"full_name":"Junlin Liu","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085460249","id":37085460249,"full_name":"Xiting Wang","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"Cardiff University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086225533","id":37086225533,"full_name":"Jing Wu","author_order":5},{"affiliation":"Tsinghua University and National Engineering Lab for Big Data Software","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490433400","id":38490433400,"full_name":"Jun Zhu","author_order":6}]},"access_type":"CCBY - IEEE is not the copyright holder of this material.

However, the development of a high performance tree boosting model is a time-consuming process that requires numerous trial-and-error experiments. To tackle this issue, we have developed a visual diagnosis tool, BOOSTVis, to help experts quickly analyze and diagnose the training process of tree boosting. In particular, we have designed a temporal confusion matrix visualization, and combined it with a t-SNE projection and a tree visualization. These visualization components work together to provide a comprehensive overview of a tree boosting model, and enable an effective diagnosis of an unsatisfactory training process. Two case studies that were conducted on the Otto Group Product Classification Challenge dataset demonstrate that BOOSTVis can provide informative feedback and guidance to improve understanding and diagnosis of tree boosting algorithms.","article_number":"8017582","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8017582","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017582/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017582/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"163","end_page":"173","citing_paper_count":12,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Boosting","Training","Decision trees","Tools","Vegetation","Visualization","Analytical models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["tree boosting","model analysis","temporal confusion matrix","tree visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2744339","title":"Skeleton-Based Scagnostics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":83,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Institute of Computer Science, Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086217387","id":37086217387,"full_name":"José Matute","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Johann Bernoulli Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268047100","id":37268047100,"full_name":"Alexandru C.

Scatterplot diagnostics (scagnostics) approaches measure characteristics of scatterplots to automatically find potentially interesting plots, thereby making SPLOMs more scalable with the dimension count. While statistical measures such as regression lines can capture orientation, and graph-theoretic scagnostics measures can capture shape, there is no scatterplot characterization measure that uses both descriptors. Based on well-known results in shape analysis, we propose a scagnostics approach that captures both scatterplot shape and orientation using skeletons (or medial axes). Our representation can handle complex spatial distributions, helps discovery of principal trends in a multiscale way, scales visually well with the number of samples, is robust to noise, and is automatic and fast to compute. We define skeleton-based similarity metrics for the visual exploration and analysis of SPLOMs. We perform a user study to measure the human perception of scatterplot similarity and compare the outcome to our results as well as to graph-based scagnostics and other visual quality metrics. Our skeleton-based metrics outperform previously defined measures both in terms of closeness to perceptually-based similarity and computation time efficiency.","article_number":"8017649","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8017649","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017649/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017649/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"542","end_page":"552","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Shape","Two dimensional displays","Visualization","Shape measurement","Skeleton","Correlation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Multidimensional Data (primary keyword)","High-Dimensional Data"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2743978","title":"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: A Theoretical Framework for the Assessment of Continuous Colormaps","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":84,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085421815","id":37085421815,"full_name":"Roxana Bujack","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"University of Texas, Austin","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086219721","id":37086219721,"full_name":"Terece L.

According to the analysis focus, the analyst may need to cluster trajectories by similarity of their relevant parts only. Throughout the analysis process, the focus may change, and different parts of trajectories may become relevant. We propose an analytical workflow in which interactive filtering tools are used to attach relevance flags to elements of trajectories, clustering is done using a distance function that ignores irrelevant elements, and the resulting clusters are summarized for further analysis.

A nonlinear narrative is a storytelling device that portrays events of a story out of chronological order, e.g., in reverse order or going back and forth between past and future events. Many acclaimed movies employ unique narrative patterns which in turn have inspired other movies and contributed to the broader analysis of narrative patterns in movies. However, understanding and communicating nonlinear narratives is a difficult task due to complex temporal disruptions in the order of events as well as no explicit records specifying the actual temporal order of the underlying story. Story curves visualize the nonlinear narrative of a movie by showing the order in which events are told in the movie and comparing them to their actual chronological order, resulting in possibly meandering visual patterns in the curve. We also present Story Explorer, an interactive tool that visualizes a story curve together with complementary information such as characters and settings. Story Explorer further provides a script curation interface that allows users to specify the chronological order of events in movies. We used Story Explorer to analyze 10 popular nonlinear movies and describe the spectrum of narrative patterns that we discovered, including some novel patterns not previously described in the literature. Feedback from experts highlights potential use cases in screenplay writing and analysis, education and film production. A controlled user study shows that users with no expertise are able to understand visual patterns of nonlinear narratives using story curves.","article_number":"8017584","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8017584","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017584/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017584/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"595","end_page":"604","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Motion pictures","Metadata","Tools","Writing","Production","Games"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Nonlinear narrative","storytelling","visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2744138","title":"Priming and Anchoring Effects in Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":89,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"RWTH Aachen University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37863270200","id":37863270200,"full_name":"André Calero Valdez","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"RWTH Aachen University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37855949400","id":37855949400,"full_name":"Martina Ziefle","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"University of Vienna","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590945600","id":37590945600,"full_name":"Michael Sedlmair","author_order":3}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We investigate priming and anchoring effects on perceptual tasks in visualization.

The analysis of urban forms can help planners develop high-quality urban spaces through evidence-based design. However, such analysis is complex because of the involvement of spatial, multi-scale (i.e., city, region, and street), and multivariate (e.g., greenery and sky ratios) natures of urban forms. In addition, current methods either lack quantitative measurements or are limited to a small area. The primary contribution of this work is the design of StreetVizor, an interactive visual analytics system that helps planners leverage their domain knowledge in exploring human-scale urban forms based on street view images. Our system presents two-stage visual exploration: 1) an AOI Explorer for the visual comparison of spatial distributions and quantitative measurements in two areas-of-interest (AOIs) at city- and region-scales; 2) and a Street Explorer with a novel parallel coordinate plot for the exploration of the fine-grained details of the urban forms at the street-scale. We integrate visualization techniques with machine learning models to facilitate the detection of street view patterns. We illustrate the applicability of our approach with case studies on the real-world datasets of four cities, i.e., Hong Kong, Singapore, Greater London and New York City. Interviews with domain experts demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in facilitating various analytical tasks.","article_number":"8017655","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8017655","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017655/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017655/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"1004","end_page":"1013","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Urban areas","Green products","Visual analytics","Correlation","Layout"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Urban forms","human scale","street view","visual analytics"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2744843","title":"Graphiti: Interactive Specification of Attribute-Based Edges for Network Modeling and Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":91,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086239144","id":37086239144,"full_name":"Arjun Srinivasan","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"The Ohio State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085680644","id":37085680644,"full_name":"Hyunwoo Park","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681759500","id":37681759500,"full_name":"Alex Endert","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37829310200","id":37829310200,"full_name":"Rahul C.

While several existing tools allow users to visualize pre-defined networks, creating these networks from raw data remains a challenging task, often requiring users to program custom scripts or write complex SQL commands. Some existing tools also allow users to both visualize and model networks. Interaction techniques adopted by these tools often assume users know the exact conditions for defining edges in the resulting networks. This assumption may not always hold true, however. In cases where users do not know much about attributes in the dataset or when there are several attributes to choose from, users may not know which attributes they could use to formulate linking conditions. We propose an alternate interaction technique to model networks that allows users to demonstrate to the system a subset of nodes and links they wish to see in the resulting network. The system, in response, recommends conditions that can be used to model networks based on the specified nodes and links. In this paper, we show how such a demonstration-based interaction technique can be used to model networks by employing it in a prototype tool, Graphiti. Through multiple usage scenarios, we show how Graphiti not only allows users to model networks from a tabular dataset but also facilitates updating a pre-defined network with additional edge types.","article_number":"8019835","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8019835","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019835/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019835/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"226","end_page":"235","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Tools","Data visualization","Joining processes","Data models","Prototypes","Image color analysis","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Network modeling","visual analytics","user interaction"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2744683","title":"Do Convolutional Neural Networks Learn Class Hierarchy?","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":92,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Bosch Research North AmericaPalo Alto, CA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086215853","id":37086215853,"full_name":"Alsallakh Bilal","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Michigan State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37075747300","id":37075747300,"full_name":"Amin Jourabloo","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Bosch Research North AmericaPalo Alto, CA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086056004","id":37086056004,"full_name":"Mao Ye","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Michigan State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37076098000","id":37076098000,"full_name":"Xiaoming Liu","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"Bosch Research North AmericaPalo Alto, CA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086048784","id":37086048784,"full_name":"Liu Ren","author_order":5}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) currently achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in image classification.

We present visual-analytics methods to reveal and analyze this hierarchy of similar classes in relation with CNN-internal data. We found that this hierarchy not only dictates the confusion patterns between the classes, it furthermore dictates the learning behavior of CNNs. In particular, the early layers in these networks develop feature detectors that can separate high-level groups of classes quite well, even after a few training epochs. In contrast, the latter layers require substantially more epochs to develop specialized feature detectors that can separate individual classes. We demonstrate how these insights are key to significant improvement in accuracy by designing hierarchy-aware CNNs that accelerate model convergence and alleviate overfitting.

We present a novel stable treemapping algorithm that has very high visual quality. Whereas existing treemapping algorithms generally recompute the treemap every time the input changes, our algorithm changes the layout of the treemap using only local modifications. This approach not only gives us direct control over stability, but it also allows us to use a larger set of possible layouts, thus provably resulting in treemaps of higher visual quality compared to existing algorithms. We further prove that we can reach all possible treemap layouts using only our local modifications. Furthermore, we introduce a new measure for stability that better captures the relative positions of rectangles. We finally show via experiments on real-world data that our algorithm outperforms existing treemapping algorithms also in practice on either visual quality and/or stability.

Each technique in our study is located at a different position along these three dimensions. We asked 15 participants to perform four tasks, each task having different levels of difficulty for both spatial perception and degrees of freedom for interaction.

In this paper, we interpret VA research through the lens of Activity Theory (AT) - a framework for modelling human activities that has been influential in the field of Human-Computer Interaction. We first provide an overview of Activity Theory, showing its potential for thinking beyond tasks, representations, and interactions to the broader systems of activity in which interactive tools are embedded and used. Next, we describe how Activity Theory can be used as an organizing framework in the construction of activity typologies, building and expanding upon the tradition of abstract task taxonomies in the field of Information Visualization. We then apply the resulting process to create an activity typology for Visual Analytics, synthesizing a wide range of systems and activity concepts from the literature. Finally, we use this typology as the foundation of an activity-centered design process, highlighting both tensions and opportunities in the design space of VA systems.","article_number":"8019880","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8019880","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019880/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019880/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"267","end_page":"277","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Human computer interaction","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Activity theory","visual analytics","activity-centered design","literature review","human-computer interaction"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2752478","title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":100,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Provides a listing of current staff, committee members and society officers.","article_number":"8167068","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8167068","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"i","end_page":"Bii","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2752618","title":"VAST Steering Committee","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":101,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Presents a listing of the VAST Steering Committee.","article_number":"8165930","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8165930","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"xx","end_page":"xx","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2752599","title":"VIS Conference Committee","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":102,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Presents a listing of the VIS Conference committee.","article_number":"8165925","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8165925","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"xvii","end_page":"xvii","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2752498","title":"Contents","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":103,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Presents the table of contents for this issue of the publication.","article_number":"8165931","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8165931","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"iii","end_page":"ix","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2752581","title":"VAST International Program Committee","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":104,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Presents a listing of the VAST International Program Committee.","article_number":"8165935","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8165935","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"xviii","end_page":"xix","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2752539","title":"IEEE Visualization and Graphics Technical Committee (VGTC)","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":105,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"VGTC","full_name":"Cláudio T.

I am pleased to introduce this special issue containing 99 papers presented at IEEE VIS 2017, which includes the Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (IEEE VAST 2017), the IEEE Information Visualization Conference (IEEE InfoVis 2017), and the IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference (IEEE SciVis 2017), held in Phoenix, USA, from the 1st to the 6th of October 2017. These papers, selected from 467 submissions, were recommended for acceptance by the Program Committees of these three conferences, after having undergone a rigorous and competitive two-round review process. The cooperation between TVCG and IEEE VIS has been considerably growing over the years in terms of the number of publications in the TVCG IEEE VIS special issue, and of the size of attendance to IEEE VIS. This special hybrid publication model enables timely dissemination of many high-quality research results from the world’s top visualization conferences to TVCG readership, while improving the overall visibility and quality of IEEE VIS publications through a rigorous journal-style review. Since 2011, the authors of TVCG regular papers have been invited to give an oral presentation of their recent work at IEEE VIS, thus providing a unique opportunity for the VIS audience to keep abreast of high-quality visualization research featured in regular issues of TVCG, and encouraging more TVCG authors to attend IEEE VIS. This closely coupled relation-ship between TVCG and VIS has been leading to a more timely exchange of new ideas, to a rapid dissemination of visualization research via an integrated forum for both publications and presentations, and to further expanding our visualization community.","article_number":"8165928","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8165928","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"x","end_page":"x","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2752619","title":"VAST Paper Reviewers","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":107,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Presents a listing of VAST conference reviewers.","article_number":"8165934","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8165934","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8165924,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan. 2018","start_page":"xxi","end_page":"xxv","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2752584","title":"The 2017 Visualization Technical Achievement Award","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":108,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Washington","full_name":"Jeffrey Heer","author_order":1}]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The 2017 Visualization Technical Achievement Award goes to Jeffrey Heer in recognition of his work on the design, development, dissemination, and popularization of languages for visualization.
