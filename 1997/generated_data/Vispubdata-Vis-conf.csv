Vis-conf,1997,Singularities in nonuniform tensor fields,10.1109/VISUAL.1997.663857,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1997.663857,59,66,Conferences,"Studies the topology of 2nd-order symmetric tensor fields. Degenerate points are basic constituents of tensor fields. From the set of degenerate points, an experienced researcher can reconstruct a whole tensor field. We address the conditions for the existence of degenerate points and, based on these conditions, we predict the distribution of degenerate points inside the field. Every tensor can be decomposed into a deviator and an isotropic tensor. A deviator determines the properties of a tensor field, while the isotropic part provides a uniform bias. Deviators can be 3D or locally 2D. The triple-degenerate points of a tensor field are associated with the singular points of its deviator and the double-degenerate points of a tensor field have singular local 2D deviators. This provides insights into the similarity of topological structure between 1st-order (or vectors) and 2nd-order tensors. Control functions are in charge of the occurrences of a singularity of a deviator. These singularities can further be linked to important physical properties of the underlying physical phenomena. For a deformation tensor in a stationary flow, the singularities of its deviator actually represent the area of the vortex core in the field; for a stress tensor, the singularities represent the area with no stress; for a Newtonian flow, compressible flow and incompressible flow as well as stress and deformation tensors share similar topological features due to the similarity of their deviators; for a viscous flow, removing the large, isotropic pressure contribution dramatically enhances the anisotropy due to viscosity.",,Yingmei Lavin;Y.

Since visualization of large data sets can be very time-consuming in both computation and rendering time, the task is distributed over multiple machines, each of which is specialized for some aspect of the visualization process. All modules must run asynchronously to maintain the highest level of interactivity.

Vis-conf,1997,Principal stream surfaces,10.1109/VISUAL.1997.663859,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1997.663859,75,80,Conferences,"The use of stream surfaces and streamlines is well established in vector visualization. However, the proper placement of starting points is critical for these constructs to clearly illustrate the flow topology. In this paper, we present the principal stream surface algorithm, which automatically generates stream surfaces that properly depict the topology of an irrotational flow. For each velocity point in the fluid field, we construct the normal to the principal stream surface through the point. The set of all such normal vectors is used to construct the principal stream function, which is a scalar field describing the direction of velocity in the fluid field. Volume rendering can then be used to visualize the principal stream function, which is directly related to the flow topology. Thus, topology in a fluid field can be easily modeled and rendered.",,Wenli Cai;Pheng-Ann Heng,"Fraunhofer Inst. for Comput. Graphics, Germany;",,,,3,,
Vis-conf,1997,Visualization of large terrains in resource-limited computing environments,10.1109/VISUAL.1997.663863,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1997.663863,95,102,Conferences,"The authors describe a software system supporting interactive visualization of large terrains in a resource-limited environment, i.e. a low-end client computer accessing a large terrain database server through a low-bandwidth network. By ""large"", they mean that the size of the terrain database is orders of magnitude larger than the computer RAM. Superior performance is achieved by manipulating both geometric and texture data at a continuum of resolutions, and, at any given moment, using the best resolution dictated by the CPU and bandwidth constraints. The geometry is maintained as a Delaunay triangulation of a dynamic subset of the terrain data points, and the texture compressed by a progressive wavelet scheme. A careful blend of algorithmic techniques enables the system to achieve superior rendering performance on a low-end computer by optimizing the number of polygons and texture pixels sent to the graphics pipeline. It guarantees a frame rate depending only on the size and quality of the rendered image, independent of the viewing parameters and scene database size. An efficient paging scheme minimizes data I/O, thus enabling the use of the system in a low-bandwidth client/server data-streaming scenario, such as on the Internet.",,B. Rabinovich;C.

Using line integral convolution (LIC) as the underlying method, a new convolution algorithm is proposed that can effectively trace the flow's global features over time. The new algorithm consists of a time-accurate value depositing scheme and a successive feedforward method. The value depositing scheme accurately models the flow advection, and the successive feedforward method maintains the coherence between animation frames. The new algorithm can produce time-accurate, highly coherent flow animations to highlight global features in unsteady flow fields.

The rendering complexity is reduced to the geometry of the current cell thus increasing interactive performance. A portal is a generalization of windows and doors. It connects two adjacent cells (or rooms). Each portal of the current cell that is some distance away from the viewpoint is rendered as a texture. The portal texture (smoothly) returns to geometry when the viewpoint gets close to the portal. This way all portal sequences (not too close to the viewpoint) have a depth complexity of one. The size of each texture and distance at which the transition occurs is configurable for each portal.,,D.G. Aliaga;A.A. Lastra,"Dept. of Comput.

However most visualization methods are designed to show only some statistical features of the data set. The paper deals with the visualization of trajectories of high-dimensional dynamical systems which form a L/sub n//sup n/ data set of a smooth n-dimensional flow. Three methods that are based on the idea of parallel coordinates are presented and discussed.

Recursive subdivision generates a visually pleasing smooth surface in the limit from an initial user-specified polygonal mesh through the repeated application of a fixed set of subdivision rules. In this paper, we present a new dynamic surface model based on the Catmull-Clark (1978) subdivision scheme, which is a very popular method to model complicated objects of arbitrary genus because of many of its nice properties. Our new dynamic surface model inherits the attractive properties of the Catmull-Clark subdivision scheme as well as that of the physics-based modeling paradigm. This new model provides a direct and intuitive means of manipulating geometric shapes, a fast, robust and hierarchical approach for recovering complex geometric shapes from range and volume data using very few degrees of freedom (control vertices). We provide an analytic formulation and introduce the physical quantities required to develop the dynamic subdivision surface model which can be interactively deformed by applying synthesized forces in real time. The governing dynamic differential equation is derived using Lagrangian mechanics and a finite element discretization. Our experiments demonstrate that this new dynamic model has a promising future in computer graphics, geometric shape design and scientific visualization.",,C. Mandal;Hong Qin;B.C.

The framework is generated through a recursive subdivision of the volume data and is represented by binary trees. Instead of using a certain level of the Multi-Tetra framework for approximation, an error-based model (EBM) is generated by recursively fusing a sequence of tetrahedra from different levels of the Multi-Tetra framework. The EBM significantly reduces the number of voxels required to model an object, while preserving the original topology. The approach provides continuous distribution of rendered intensity or generated isosurfaces along boundaries of different levels-of-detail thus solving the crack problem. The model supports typical rendering approaches, such as marching cubes, direct volume projection, and splatting. Experimental results demonstrate the strengths of the approach.",,Yong Zhou;Baoquan Chen;A. Kaufman,"Center for Visual Comput., State Univ. of New York, Stony Brook, NY, USA;;",,,,34,,

We present a method based on finite element approximations which combines these two approaches in a new and unique way that is conceptually simple and theoretically sound. The main idea is to consider mesh reduction as an approximation problem in appropriate finite element spaces. Starting with a very coarse triangulation of the functional domain, a hierarchy of highly non-uniform tetrahedral (or triangular in 2D) meshes is generated adaptively by local refinement. This process is driven by controlling the local error of the piecewise linear finite element approximation of the function on each mesh element. A reliable and efficient computation of the global approximation error and a multilevel preconditioned conjugate gradient solver are the key components of the implementation. In order to analyze the properties and advantages of the adaptively generated tetrahedral meshes, we implemented two volume visualization algorithms: an iso-surface extractor and a ray-caster. Both algorithms, while conceptually simple, show significant speedups over conventional methods delivering comparable rendering quality from adaptively compressed datasets.",,R. Grosso;C. Lurig;T.

Vis-conf,1997,GADGET: goal-oriented application design guidance for modular visualization environments,10.1109/VISUAL.1997.663889,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1997.663889,245,252,Conferences,"Modular visualization environments (MVEs) have recently been regarded as the de facto standard for scientific data visualization, mainly due to adoption of the visual programming style, reusability, and extendability. However, since scientists and engineers as the MVE principal user are not always familiar with how to map numerical data to proper graphical primitives, the set of built-in modules is not fully used to construct necessary application networks. Therefore, a certain mechanism needs to be incorporated into MVEs, which makes use of heuristics and expertise of visualization specialists (visineers), and which supports the user in designing his/her applications with MVEs. The Wehrend's goal-oriented taxonomy of visualization techniques is adopted as the basic philosophy to develop a system, called GADGET, for application design guidance for MVEs. The GADGET system interactively helps the user design appropriate applications according to the specific visualization goals, temporal efficiency versus accuracy requirements, and such properties as dimension and mesh type of a given target dataset. Also the GADGET system is capable of assisting the user in customizing a prototype modular network for his/her desired applications by showing execution examples involving datasets of the same type. The paper provides an overview of the GADGET guidance mechanism and system architecture, with an emphasis on its knowledge base design.

On current graphics hardware, the problem is to maintain dynamic, view-dependent triangle meshes and texture maps that produce good images at the required frame rate. We present an algorithm for constructing triangle meshes that optimizes flexible view-dependent error metrics, produces guaranteed error bounds, achieves specified triangle counts directly and uses frame-to-frame coherence to operate at high frame rates for thousands of triangles per frame. Our method, dubbed Real-time Optimally Adapting Meshes (ROAM), uses two priority queues to drive split and merge operations that maintain continuous triangulations built from pre-processed bintree triangles. We introduce two additional performance optimizations: incremental triangle stripping and priority-computation deferral lists. ROAM's execution time is proportional to the number of triangle changes per frame, which is typically a few percent of the output mesh size; hence ROAM's performance is insensitive to the resolution and extent of the input terrain.

The main idea is to preprocess the data set once and for all to build an efficient search structure in disk, and then each time one wants to extract an isosurface, they perform an output-sensitive query on the search structure to retrieve only those active cells that are intersected by the isosurface. During the query operation, only two blocks of main memory space are needed, and only those active cells are brought into the main memory, plus some negligible overhead of disk accesses. This implies that one can efficiently visualize very large data sets on workstations with just enough main memory to hold the isosurfaces themselves. The implementation is delicate but not complicated. They give the first implementation of the I/O-optimal interval tree, and also implement their methods as an I/O filter for Vtk's isosurface extraction for the case of unstructured grids. They show that, in practice, the algorithms improve the performance of isosurface extraction by speeding up the active-cell searching process so that it is no longer a bottleneck. Moreover, this search time is independent of the main memory available. The practical efficiency of the techniques reflects their theoretical optimality.",,Yi-Jen Chiang;C.T.

A novel volumetric data visualization scheme is proposed and implemented in this work that renders 2D images directly from compressed 3D data sets. The novelty of this algorithm is that rendering is performed on the compressed representation of the volumetric data without pre-decompression. As a result, the overheads associated with both data movement and rendering processing are significantly reduced. The proposed algorithm generalizes previously proposed whole-volume frequency-domain rendering schemes by first dividing the 3D data set into subcubes, transforming each subcube to a frequency-domain representation, and applying the Fourier projection theorem to produce the projected 2D images according to given viewing angles. Compared to the whole-volume approach, the subcube-based scheme not only achieves higher compression efficiency by exploiting local coherency, but also improves the quality of resultant rendering images because it approximates the occlusion effect on a subcube by subcube basis.",,Tzi-Cker Chiueh;Chuan-Kai Yang;Taosong He;H.

It is based on an original data structure called the motion map. The motion map contains not only a dense representation of the flow field but also all the motion information required to animate the flow. An important feature of this method is that it allows, in a natural way, cyclical variable-speed animations. As far as efficiency is concerned, the advantage of this method is that computing the motion map does not take more time than computing a single still image of the flow and the motion map has to be computed only once. Another advantage is that the memory requirements for a cyclical animation of an arbitrary number of frames amounts to the memory cost of a single still image.",,B. Jobard;W.

Errors like cracks, degeneracies, duplication, holes and overlaps are usually introduced in solid models due to imprecise arithmetic, model transformations, designer errors, programming bugs, etc. Such errors often hamper further processing such as finite element analysis, radiosity computation and rapid prototyping. Our fault-repair algorithm converts an unordered collection of polygons to a shared-vertex representation to help eliminate errors. This is done by choosing, for each polygon edge, the most appropriate edge to unify it with. The two edges are then geometrically merged into one, by moving vertices. At the end of this process, each polygon edge is either coincident with another or is a boundary edge for a polygonal hole or a dangling wall and may be appropriately repaired. Finally, in order to allow user-inspection of the automatic corrections, we produce a visualization of the repair and let the user mark the corrections that conflict with the original design intent. A second iteration of the correction algorithm then produces a repair that is commensurate with the intent. This, by involving the users in a feedback loop, we are able to refine the correction to their satisfaction.",,G. Barequet;S. Kumar,"Dept. of Comput.

Abstractly, the information to be displayed consists of a large number of objects, a set of features that are likely to be of interest to the user, and some function that measures the relevance level of every object to the various features. The goal is to provide the user with a concise and comprehensible visualization of that information. For the type of applications concentrated on, the exact relevance measures of the objects are not significant. This enables accuracy to be traded for a clearer display. The idea is to ""flatten"" the multidimensionality of the feature space into a 2D ""relevance map"", capturing the inter-relations among the features, without causing too many ambiguous interpretations of the results. To better reflect the nature of the data and to resolve the ambiguity the authors refine the given set of features and introduce the notion of composed features. The layout of the map is then obtained by grading it according to a set of rules and using a simulated annealing algorithm which optimizes the layout with respect to these rules.

In particular, direct volume rendering of these data types is numerically complex and mostly requires sorting the whole database. We present a new approach to direct rendering of convex, voluminous polyhedra on arbitrary grid topologies, which efficiently use hardware assisted polygon drawing to support the sorting procedure. The key idea of this technique lies in a two pass rendering approach. First, the volume primitives are drawn in polygon mode to obtain their cross sections in the VSBUFFER orthogonal to the viewing plane. Second, this buffer is traversed in front to back order and the volume integration is performed. Thus, the complexity of the sorting procedure is reduced. Furthermore, any connectivity information can be completely neglected, which allows for the rendering of arbitrary scattered, convex polyhedra.",,R. Westermann;T. Ertl,"Comput.

Volume visualization of medical images must address two important issues. First, it is difficult to segment medical scans into individual materials based only on intensity values. Second, although greyscale images are the normal method for displaying medical volumes, these types of images are not necessarily appropriate for highlighting regions of interest within the volume. Studies of the human visual system have shown that individual intensity values are difficult to detect in a greyscale image. In these situations colour is a more effective visual feature. We addressed both problems during the visualization of CT scans of abdominal aortic aneurysms. We have developed a classification method that empirically segments regions of interest in each of the 2D slices. We use a perceptual colour selection technique to identify each region of interest in both the 2D slices and the 3D reconstructed volumes. The result is a colourized volume that the radiologists are using to rapidly and accurately identify the locations and spatial interactions of different materials from their scans.

Such data lends itself to simple 2D representations. The data described in this paper was gathered by a sail plane spiraling in an updraft within a thundercloud. The more complex organization of data samples demands more complex representation methods. This paper describes a system developed using the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) to explore such data. The data consists of several scalar values and a set of vector values associated with positional data on the measuring devices. The goal of this visualization is to explore the location of point charges suggested by the electromagnetic field vectors and determine if any correlation exists between the point charge location and standard cloud microstructure scalar measurements such as temperature. There are several problems associated with visualizing this rather unique set of data. They stem from the fact that the data is a sparse spiraling sample of scalars and vectors. The system allows the track of the plane to be displayed as a line, a tube or a ribbon; scalar values can be displayed as transparent isosurfaces; and the vector data as an arrow plot along that track, given a color that is constant, based on orientation or related to the value of a scalar.

Particle behavior is dynamic and can be based on laws of physics or artificial rules. For isosurface extraction, we program particles to be attracted towards a specific surface value while simultaneously repelling adjacent particles. The repulsive forces are based on the curvature of the surface at that location. A birth-death process results in a denser concentration of particles in areas of high curvature and sparser populations in areas of lower curvature. The overall level of detail is controlled through a scaling factor that increases or decreases the repulsive forces of the particles. Once particles reach equilibrium, their locations are used as vertices in generating a triangular mesh of the surface. The advantages of our approach include: vertex densities are based on surface features rather than on the sampling rate of the volume; a single scaling factor simplifies level-of-detail control; and meshing is efficient because it uses neighbor information that has already been generated during the force calculations.",,P.

Although being restricted to uniform sampled data, the versatile approach enables the handling of a large variety of real world elements. Examples include nonparametric, parametric and implicit lines, surfaces or volumes, all of which are common to large scale data sets. The framework is based on two fundamental steps: compression is carried out by a remote server and generates a bit-stream transmitted over the underlying network. Geometric reconstruction is performed by the local client and renders a piecewise linear approximation of the data. More precisely, the compression scheme consists of a newly developed pipeline starting from an initial B-spline wavelet precoding. The fundamental properties of wavelets allow progressive transmission and interactive control of the compression gain by means of global and local oracles. In particular the authors discuss the problem of oracles in semiorthogonal settings and propose sophisticated oracles to remove unimportant coefficients. In addition, geometric constraints such as boundary lines can be compressed in a lossless manner and are incorporated into the resulting bit-stream.

The members of the first class are all equally accurate. The second class has only one member and employs a continuous derivative filter obtained through the analytic derivation of an interpolation filter. We use the new method to analytically compare the accuracy of the first class with that of the second. As a result of our analysis we show that even inexpensive schemes can in fact be more accurate than high order methods. We describe the theoretical computational cost of applying the schemes in a volume rendering application and provide guidelines for helping one choose a scheme for estimating derivatives.

Vis-conf,1997,Virtualized reality: constructing time-varying virtual worlds from real world events,10.1109/VISUAL.1997.663893,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1997.663893,277,283,Conferences,"Virtualized reality is a modeling technique that constructs full 3D virtual representations of dynamic events from multiple video streams. Image-based stereo is used to compute a range image corresponding to each intensity image in each video stream. Each range and intensity image pair encodes the scene structure and appearance of the scene visible to the camera at that moment, and is therefore called a visible surface model (VSM). A single time instant of the dynamic event can be modeled as a collection of VSMs from different viewpoints, and the full event can be modeled as a sequence of static scenes-the 3D equivalent of video. Alternatively, the collection of VSMs at a single time can be fused into a global 3D surface model, thus creating a traditional virtual representation out of real world events. Global modeling has the added benefit of eliminating the need to hand-edit the range images to correct errors made in stereo, a drawback of previous techniques. Like image-based rendering models, these virtual representations can be used to synthesize nearly any view of the virtualized event. For this reason, the paper includes a detailed comparison of existing view synthesis techniques with the authors' own approach. In the virtualized representations, however, scene structure is explicitly represented and therefore easily manipulated, for example by adding virtual objects to (or removing virtualized objects from) the model without interfering with real event. Virtualized reality, then, is a platform not only for image-based rendering but also for 3D scene manipulation.",,P. Rander;P.J. Narayanan;T.

As users demand more complex data sets, the memory requirements for retrieving and storing large 3D models are becoming excessive. In addition, the current 3D rendering hardware is facing a large memory bus bandwidth bottleneck at the processor to graphics pipeline interface. Rendering 1 million triangles with 24 bytes per triangle at 30 Hz requires as much as 720 MB/sec memory bus bandwidth. This transfer rate is well beyond the current low-cost graphics systems. A solution is to compress the static 3D geometry as an off-line pre-process. Then, only the compressed geometry needs to be stored in main memory and sent down to the graphics pipeline for real-time decompression and rendering. The author presents several new techniques for compression of 3D geometry that produce 2 to 3 times better compression ratios than existing methods. They first introduce several algorithms for the efficient encoding of the original geometry as generalized triangle meshes. This encoding allows most of the mesh vertices to be reused when forming new triangles. Their second contribution allows various parts of a geometric model to be compressed with different precision depending on the level of details present. Together, the meshifying algorithms and the variable compression method achieve compression ratios of 30 and 37 to one over ASCII encoded formats and 10 and 15 to one over binary encoded triangle strips. The experimental results show a dramatically lowered memory bandwidth required for real-time visualization of complex data sets.",,M.M. Chow,"MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA",,,,61,,

In this experiment, subjects made judgments about the correspondence of the shape, location, and magnitude of two patterns under conditions with varying amounts of random noise.

In addition, we use the mapping function to compute appropriate texture coordinates if the original map has texture coordinates at its vertices. Our overall algorithm uses edge collapse operations. We present rigorous procedures for the generation of local planar projections as well as for the selection of a new vertex position for the edge collapse operation. As compared to earlier methods, our algorithm is able to compute tight error bounds on surface deviation and produce an entire continuum of levels of detail with mappings between them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on several models: a Ford Bronco consisting of over 300 parts and 70,000 triangles, a textured lion model consisting of 49 parts and 86,000 triangles, and a textured, wrinkled torus consisting of 79,000 triangles.",,J.

The implementation handles arbitrarily large volumes, by dynamically swapping data within the local depth-limited frustum into main memory as the viewpoint moves through the volume.

However, the algorithm does not correctly render cases where the volume sampling rate is higher than the image sampling rate (e.g. more than one voxel maps into a pixel). This situation arises with orthographic projections of high-resolution volumes, as well as with perspective projections of volumes of any resolution. The result is potentially severe spatial and temporal aliasing artifacts. Some volume ray-casting algorithms avoid these artifacts by employing reconstruction kernels which vary in width as the rays diverge. Unlike ray-casting algorithms, existing splatting algorithms do not have an equivalent mechanism for avoiding these artifacts. The authors propose such a mechanism, which delivers high-quality splatted images and has the potential for a very efficient hardware implementation.",,J.E. Swan;K. Mueller;T. Moller;N. Shareel;R.

In visualization of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in particular, input data sets today can surpass 100 Gbytes, and are expected to scale with the ability of supercomputers to generate them. Some visualization tools already partition large data sets into segments, and load appropriate segments as they are needed. However, this does not remove the problem for two reasons: 1) there are data sets for which even the individual segments are too large for the largest graphics workstations, 2) many practitioners do not have access to workstations with the memory capacity required to load even a segment, especially since the state-of-the-art visualization tools tend to be developed by researchers with much more powerful machines. When the size of the data that must be accessed is larger than the size of memory, some form of virtual memory is simply required. This may be by segmentation, paging, or by paged segments. The authors demonstrate that complete reliance on operating system virtual memory for out-of-core visualization leads to egregious performance. They then describe a paged segment system that they have implemented, and explore the principles of memory management that can be employed by the application for out-of-core visualization. They show that application control over some of these can significantly improve performance. They show that sparse traversal can be exploited by loading only those data actually required.",,M. Cox;D.
