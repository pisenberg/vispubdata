"The paper presents an example of how existing visualization methods can be successfully applied-after minor modifications-for allowing new, sometimes unexpected insight into scientific questions, in this case for better understanding of unknown, microscopic biological structures. The authors present a volume rendering system supporting the visualization of LCM datasets, a new microscopic tomographic method allowing for the first time accurate and fast in-vivo inspection of the spatial structure of microscopic structures, especially important in (but not restricted to) biology. The speed, flexibility and versatility of the system allows fast, convenient, interactive operation with large datasets on small computers (workstation or PC). By testing different datasets, they have been able to significantly improve the performance of understanding the internal structure of LCM data. Most important, they have been able to show static and dynamic structures of cells never seen before and allowing significant insight in the cell movement process. Therefore they regard the system as a universal tool for the visualization of such data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568136/","LOCKED","568136","Fraunhofer-Inst. for Comput.

"Comparative visualization has successfully been applied to a variety of fluid dynamic problems. Most applications rely on image level comparison such as experimental flow visualization versus computational flow imagery (CFI) which tries to simulate optical image acquisition in flow testing. When differences become difficult to distinguish or once a quantitative result is required, data level comparison provides powerful means to visualize data from multiple sources. Data level comparison and visualization turns out to be an essential tool in modern aircraft design projects. It is already successfully applied in the geometric preprocessing stage and the CFD analysis and will serve for comparison with experimental data as well.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568140/","LOCKED","568140","DLR, German Aerosp.

"A method of lossless compression using wavelets is presented that enables progressive transmission of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) data in PLOT3D format. The floating point data is first converted to double-precision floating point format to maintain adequate precision throughout the transform process. It is then transformed using Haar wavelets-four times in two spatial dimensions, twice in the third spatial dimension, and twice in time for a total compression factor of 64 times. The double precision format will maintain enough precision during the transform to keep the process lossless. Next, the transformed data is compressed using Huffman coding and transmitted progressively using spectral selection. This allows most of the information to be transmitted in the first pass. Details are transmitted in later passes which ultimately provide for lossless reconstruction of the original data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568138/","LOCKED","568138","NSF Eng. Res.

"We present a new visualization approach to support design for manufacturing (DFM). This involves the correlation of manufacturing problems with the causative geometric characteristics. We then discuss the use of distance transform and 3-D thinning to extract these characteristics from a voxelized object. In contrast to current computer aided engineering (CAE) tools, our system is very efficient and simple to use. It does not require the skill and experience to generate and control a numerical mesh and interpret the results. The specifically tailored visualization system makes the results self-evident.

"Integrated presentation of data with uncertainty is a worthy goal in scientific visualization. It allows researchers to make informed decisions based on imperfect data. It also allows users to visually compare and contrast different algorithms for performing the same task or different models for representing the same physical phenomenon. We present LISTEN-a data sonification system that has been incorporated into two visualization systems: a system for visualizing geometric uncertainty of surface interpolants; and a system for visualizing uncertainty in fluid flow. LISTEN is written in C++ for the SGI platform. It works with the SGI internal audio chip or a MIDI device or both. LISTEN is an object-oriented system that is modular, flexible, adaptable, portable, interactive and extensible. We demonstrate that sonification is very effective as an additional tool in visualizing geometric and fluid flow uncertainty.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568105/","LOCKED","568105","Dept. of Comput. & Inf.

"The recent years have seen rapid advancement towards viewing the Earth as an integrated system. This means that we have come to understand the interdependence of the major planetary subsystems-atmosphere, biosphere, oceans and the deep earth interior-on a large range of time and length scales. One of the longest time scales of the planet is imposed by solid state convection within the silicate Earth mantle. Mantle convection modeling, and other earth science modeling efforts, now are producing simulation data on grids that are large enough to strain the memory and processing power of even the largest high-end graphics workstations. Another alternative is to use parallel visualization tools running on the massively parallel computers that generated the data. This is the approach that we have taken for the visualization of mantle convection simulation data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568144/","LOCKED","568144","Adv. Comput.

"This paper presents a novel approach to assist the user in exploring appropriate transfer functions for the visualization of volumetric datasets. The search for a transfer function is treated as a parameter optimization problem and addressed with stochastic search techniques. Starting from an initial population of (random or pre-defined) transfer functions, the evolution of the stochastic algorithms is controlled by either direct user selection of intermediate images or automatic fitness evaluation using user-specified objective functions. This approach essentially shields the user from the complex and tedious ""trial and error"" approach, and demonstrates effective and convenient generation of transfer functions.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568113/","LOCKED","568113","Dept. of Comput.

"It is well known that the spatial frequency spectra of membrane and thin-plate splines exhibit self-affine characteristics and hence behave as fractals. This behavior was exploited in generating the constrained fractal surfaces in the work of Szeliski and Terzopoulos (1989), which were generated by using a Gibbs sampler algorithm. The algorithm involves locally perturbing a constrained spline surface with white noise until the spline surface reaches an equilibrium state. In this paper, we introduce a very fast generalized Gibbs sampler that combines two novel techniques, namely a preconditioning technique in a wavelet basis for constraining the splines and a perturbation scheme in which, unlike the traditional Gibbs sampler, all sites (surface nodes) that do not share a common neighbor are updated simultaneously. In addition, we demonstrate the capability to generate arbitrary-order fractal surfaces without resorting to blending techniques. Using this fast Gibbs sampler algorithm, we demonstrate the synthesis of realistic terrain models from sparse elevation data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567598/","LOCKED","567598","Dept. of Comput. & Inf.

"A new technique for interactive vector field visualization using large numbers of properly illuminated stream lines is presented. Taking into account ambient, diffuse, and specular reflection terms as well as transparency, we employ a realistic shading model which significantly increases quality and realism of the resulting images. While many graphics workstations offer hardware support for illuminating surface primitives, usually no means for an accurate shading of line primitives are provided. However, we show that proper illumination of lines can be implemented by exploiting the texture mapping capabilities of modern graphics hardware. In this way high rendering performance with interactive frame rates can be achieved. We apply the technique to render large numbers of integral curves in a vector field. The impression of the resulting images can be further improved by making the curves partially transparent. We also describe methods for controlling the distribution of stream lines in space.

"We present efficient sequential and parallel algorithms for isosurface extraction. Based on the Span Space data representation, new data subdivision and searching methods are described. We also present a parallel implementation with an emphasis on load balancing. The performance of our sequential algorithm to locate the cell elements intersected by isosurfaces is faster than the Kd tree searching method originally used for the Span Space algorithm. The parallel algorithm can achieve high load balancing for massively parallel machines with distributed memory architectures.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568121/","LOCKED","568121","Dept. of Comput.

"An isosurface can be efficiently generated by visiting adjacent intersected cells in order, as if the isosurface were propagating itself. We previously proposed an extrema graph method (T. Itoh and K. Koyamada, 1995), which generates a graph connecting extremum points. The isosurface propagation starts from some of the intersected cells that are found both by visiting the cells through which arcs of the graph pass and by visiting the cells on the boundary of a volume. We propose an efficient method of searching for cells intersected by an isosurface. This method generates a volumetric skeleton. consisting of cells, like an extrema graph, by applying a thinning algorithm used in the image recognition area. Since it preserves the topological features of the volume and the connectivity of the extremum points, it necessarily intersects every isosurface. The method is more efficient than the extrema graph method, since it does not require that cells on the boundary be visited.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568123/","LOCKED","568123","Res.

"Almost all scientific visualization involving surfaces is currently done via triangles. The speed at which such triangulated surfaces can be displayed is crucial to interactive visualization and is bounded by the rate at which triangulated data can be sent to the graphics subsystem for rendering. Partitioning polygonal models into triangle strips can significantly reduce rendering times over transmitting each triangle individually. We present new and efficient algorithms for constructing triangle strips from partially triangulated models, and experimental results showing these strips are on average 15% better than those from previous codes. Further, we study the impact of larger buffer sizes and various queuing disciplines on the effectiveness of triangle strips.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568125/","LOCKED","568125","State Univ. of New York, Stony Brook, NY, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37861966100","1","F.

"Rendering deformable volume data currently needs separate processes for deformation and rendering, and is expensive in terms of both computational and memory costs. Recognizing the importance of unifying these processes, we present a new approach to the direct rendering of deformable volumes without explicitly constructing the intermediate deformed volumes. The volume deformation is done by a radial basis function that is piecewise linearly approximated by an adaptive subdivision of the octree encoded target volume. The octree blocks in the target volume are then projected, reverse morphed and texture mapped, using the SGI 3D texture mapping hardware, in a back-to-front order. A template-based Z-plane/block intersection method is used to expedite the block projection computation.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567609/","LOCKED","567609","Nat.

"Typically, feedback from analysis of three-dimensional volume image structures are presented in the visual domain. This ignores the potential for complementary analysis of feedback in the aural domain. This paper presents a system in which visualization of a volume image may be enhanced through representation of the voxel structure by a sound sequence (termed a 'sonification') in which a sequence of sound signals is generated by the mapping of voxel values to pitch, amplitude, timing and other acoustic parameters according to the design of the selected sound instrument(s). Stereo audio or spatial audio processing techniques are employed to enhance the perception of the representative sonification as emanating from the visual loci of the associated voxel.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568129/","LOCKED","568129","Dept. of Inf.

"In researching the communication mechanisms between cells of the immune system, visualization of proteins in three dimensions can be used to determine which proteins are capable of interacting with one another at a given time by showing their spatial colocality. Volume data sets are created using digital confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. A variety of visualization approaches are then used to examine the interactions. These include volume rendering, isosurface extraction, and virtual reality. Based on our experiences, we have concluded that no single one of these approaches provides a complete solution for visualizing biological data. However, in combination, their respective strengths complement one another to provide an understanding of the data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568133/","LOCKED","568133","Dept. of Pediatrics, Nat.

"The paper presents interactive flow visualization methods that highlight directional information in the flow field. An added benefit of the proposed methods is that they reduce the amount of data being displayed and hence reduce clutter. The main idea behind these methods is the use of light sources to select and highlight regions in the flow field with similar directions. Varying the lighting conditions, by moving the light source and/or adding more lights, emphasizes different vector directions, set of directions, and vectors within a specified angle of a particular direction. The methods are straight forward, computationally inexpensive, and can be combined with other techniques that use glyph representation and other flow geometry such as streamlines for feature visualization. The authors apply these methods to an analytic data set to help explain how they work, and then to a simulation data set to highlight flow reversals.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568139/","LOCKED","568139","Dept. of Comput.

"In many mechanical design-related activities, the visualization tool needs to convey not only the shape of the objects, but also their interior problem regions. Due to the binary nature of these models, existing shading models often fall short of supporting a realistic display. In this case study, we present several new contextual shading methods that we originally developed for our design visualization tools. The results are then compared with gray-scale shading applied to a gray-level version of the binary object. The comparison shows that our method can be applied to any binary object and yields promising results.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568143/","LOCKED","568143","Center for Die Casting, Ohio State Univ., Columbus, OH, USA","","1","S.C.

In most previous work, each layer is interpolated independently of what happened or will happen in the other layers.

"Existing volume visualization techniques are typically applied to a three-dimensional grid. This presents some challenging problems in the visualization of environmental data. This data often consists of unevenly distributed samples. Typically a two-step approach is used to visualize environmental data. First the unevenly distributed sample data are modeled onto a uniform 3-D grid. This grid model is subsequently rendered using conventional grid-based visualization techniques. This paper discusses some of the limitations of this approach and highlights areas where further research is needed to improve the accuracy of visualization for environmental applications.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568145/","LOCKED","568145","Dept. of Math., Akron Univ., OH, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37855601300","1","Yingcai Xiao","37855601300","","","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37619701300","2","J.P.

"Sampling and analysis of subsurface contaminants comprise the first steps toward environmental remediation of hazardous spills. We have developed software tools to support the analysis phase, using three different schemes for interpolating scattered 3D soil-quality data onto a grid suitable for viewing in an interactive visualization system. A good interpolation scheme is one that respects the distribution of the original data. We find that the original data can be decimated by up to seventy percent while exhibiting graceful degradation in quality. A prototype software system is being deployed to allow technicians to visually determine, while in the field with their monitoring equipment, where the highest concentrations of contaminants lie. The system is now in use by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568147/","LOCKED","568147","NSF Eng. Res.

"Given (n-1)-dimensional parallel cross-sections of an n-dimensional body, one would like to reconstruct the n-dimensional body. The method based on Distance Field Interpolation (DFI) gives a robust solution to this problem in its ability to deal with any topology in any dimension. Still this method may give undesired solutions to the problem if the changes from one cross-section to the next are significant relative to the size of the details in the cross-sections. We consider the problem of solid reconstruction from contours, which can also be considered as a contour blending or contour morphing problem, where the third dimension is time. The method presented is based on interpolation of the distance field, guided by a warp function which is controlled by a set of corresponding anchor points. Some rules for defining a smooth least-distorting warp function are given. To reduce the distortion of the intermediate shapes, the warp function is decomposed into a rigid rotational part and an elastic part. The distance field interpolation method is modified so that the interpolation is guided by the warp function. The advantage of the new approach is that it is capable of blending between contours having different topological genus, and no correspondence between the geometric primitives should be established. The desired general correspondence is defined by the user in terms of a relatively small number of anchor points.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567812/","LOCKED","567812","Sch. of Math.

"The representation of a scene at different levels of detail is necessary to achieve real-time rendering. In aerial views, only the part of the scene that is close to the viewing point needs to be displayed with a high level of detail, while more distant parts can be displayed with a low level of detail. However, when a sequence of images is generated and displayed in real-time, the transition between different levels of detail causes noticeable temporal aliasing. In this paper, we propose a method, based on object blending, that visually softens the transition between two levels of Delaunay triangulation. We present an algorithm that establishes, in an off-line process, a correspondence between two given polygonal objects. The correspondence enables on-line blending between two representations of an object, so that one representation (level of detail) progressively evolves into the other.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567600/","LOCKED","567600","Sch. of Math.

"Uncertainty or errors are introduced in fluid flow data as the data is acquired, transformed and rendered. Although researchers are aware of these uncertainties, little has been done to incorporate them in the existing visualization systems for fluid flow. In the absence of integrated presentation of data and its associated uncertainty, the analysis of the visualization is incomplete at best and may lead to inaccurate or incorrect conclusions. The article presents UFLOW-a system for visualizing uncertainty in fluid flow. Although there are several sources of uncertainties in fluid flow data, in this work, we focus on uncertainty arising from the use of different numerical algorithms for computing particle traces in a fluid flow. The techniques that we have employed to visualize uncertainty in fluid flow include uncertainty glyphs, flow envelopes, animations, priority sequences, twirling batons of trace viewpoints, and rakes. These techniques are effective in making the users aware of the effects of different integration methods and their sensitivity, especially near critical points in the flow field.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568116/","LOCKED","568116","Dept. of Comput.

"A method for visualizing unknottedness of mathematical knots via energy optimization with simulated annealing is presented. In this method a potential field is formed around a tangled rope that causes it to self-repel. By allowing the rope to evolve in this field in search of an energy minimizing configuration we can determine the knot type of the initial configuration. In particular, it is natural to conjecture that if such a ""charged rope"" was not initially knotted, it will reach its minimal potential in a circular configuration, given a suitable energy functional. Because situations potentially arise in which the functional may not be strictly unimodal, we suggest it to be advantageous to use a robust stochastic optimization technique (simulated annealing), rather than a deterministic hill climber common in physically based approaches, to make sure that the evolving rope does not settle in a suboptimal configuration. The same method is applicable to simplifying arbitrary knots and links and for establishing knot equivalence. Aside from its theoretical appeal, the method promises to solve practical problems common in genetic research and polymer design.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568120/","LOCKED","568120","Dept. of Electr.

"In the last five years, there has been numerous applications of wavelets and multiresolution analysis in many fields of computer graphics as different as geometric modelling, volume visualization or illumination modelling. Classical multiresolution analysis is based on the knowledge of a nested set of functional spaces in which the successive approximations of a given function converge to that function, and can be efficiently computed. This paper first proposes a theoretical framework which enables multiresolution analysis even if the functional spaces are not nested, as long as they still have the property that the successive approximations converge to the given function. Based on this concept, we finally introduce a new multiresolution analysis with exact reconstruction for large data sets defined on uniform grids. We construct a one-parameter family of multiresolution analyses which is a blending of Haar and linear multiresolution, using BLaC (Blending of Linear and Constant) wavelets.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567602/","LOCKED","567602","Lab.

"We describe a technique for choosing multiple colours for use during data visualization. Our goal is a systematic method for maximizing the total number of colours available for use, while still allowing an observer to rapidly and accurately search a display for any one of the given colours. Previous research suggests that we need to consider three separate effects during colour selection: colour distance, linear separation, and colour category. We describe a simple method for measuring and controlling all of these effects. Our method was tested by performing a set of target identification studies; we analysed the ability of thirty eight observers to find a colour target in displays that contained differently coloured background elements. Results showed our method can be used to select a group of colours that will provide good differentiation between data elements during data visualization.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568118/","LOCKED","568118","Dept. of Comput.

"In many cases the surfaces of geometric models consist of a large number of triangles. Several algorithms were developed to reduce the number of triangles required to approximate such objects. Algorithms that measure the deviation between the approximated object and the original object are only available for special cases. We use the Hausdorff distance between the original and the simplified mesh as a geometrically meaningful error value which can be applied to arbitrary triangle meshes. We present a new algorithm to reduce the number of triangles of a mesh without exceeding a user defined Hausdorff distance between the original and simplified mesh. As this distance is parameterization independent, its use as error measure is superior to the use of the L/sup /spl infin//-Norm between parameterized surfaces. Furthermore the Hausdorff distance is always less than the distance induced by the L/sup /spl infin//-Norm. This results in higher reduction rates. Excellent results were achieved by the new decimation algorithm for triangle meshes that has been used in different application areas such as volume rendering, terrain modeling and the approximations of parameterized surfaces. The key advantages of the new algorithm are: it guarantees a user defined position dependent approximation error; it allows one to generate a hierarchical geometric representation in a canonical way; it automatically preserves sharp edges.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568124/","LOCKED","568124","Wilhelm-Schickard-Inst. fur Inf., Tubingen Univ., Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271619700","1","R.

"A general volume rendering technique is described that efficiently produces images of excellent quality from data defined over irregular grids having a wide variety of formats. Rendering is done in software, eliminating the need for special graphics hardware, as well as any artifacts associated with graphics hardware. Images of volumes with about 1,000,000 cells can be produced in one to several minutes on a workstation with a 150-MHz processor. A significant advantage of this method for applications such as computational fluid dynamics is that it can process multiple intersecting grids. Such grids present problems for most current volume rendering techniques. Also, the wide range of cell sizes does not present difficulties, as it does for many techniques. A spatial hierarchical organization makes it possible to access data from a restricted region efficiently. The tree has greater depth in regions of greater detail, determined by the number of cells in the region. It also makes it possible to render useful ""preview"" images very quickly by displaying each region associated with a tree node as one cell. Previews show enough detail to navigate effectively in very large data sets. The algorithmic techniques include use of a k-d tree, with prefix-order partitioning of triangles, to reduce the number of primitives that must be processed for one rendering, coarse-grain parallelism for a shared-memory MIMD architecture, a new perspective transformation that achieves greater numerical accuracy, and a scanline algorithm with depth sorting and a new clipping technique.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567606/","LOCKED","567606","California Univ., Santa Cruz, CA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37828154400","1","J.

The simplifications are dependent on viewing direction, lighting and visibility, and are performed by taking advantage of image-space, object-space and frame-to-frame coherences. A continuous level-of-detail representation for an object is first constructed off-line. This representation is then used at run-time to guide the selection of appropriate triangles for display. The list of displayed triangles is updated incrementally from one frame to the next. Our approach is more effective than the current level-of-detail-based rendering approaches for most scientific visualization applications where there are a limited number of highly complex objects that stay relatively close to the viewer.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568126/","LOCKED","568126","State Univ. of New York, Stony Brook, NY, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37850740800","1","J.C.

"We describe an on-going project that is using visualization as an indispensable tool for the restoration of the disintegrated ceiling of a ritual precinct that was discovered during archaeological excavations of a group of pre-Inca temples in Peru. This ceiling is unique-it is the only one ever found that has pictures painted on it, rather than being simply white-washed. The restoration of the ceiling, and the recovery of these iconographic figures will provide an unprecedented opportunity to study the culture of the Moche people who build and used these temples.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568132/","LOCKED","568132","IBM Thomas J.

"The case study describes a system that allows the use of interactive volume rendering for routine clinical diagnosis. In this setup, a SGI RealityStation acts like a remote rendering system which is controlled by a user interface that was added to an existing clinical system. The paper describes some implementation aspects, including several system optimizations that were carried out in order to optimize rendering speed. Initial results are very promising; the authors present three examples of clinical findings that were made using this system. Because of the setup, clinicians are now much more aware of the possibilities that modern hardware offers for interactive volume visualization.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568134/","LOCKED","568134","Inst. of Med.

"Information visualization faces challenges presented by the need to represent abstract data and the relationships within the data. Previously, we presented a system for visualizing similarities between a single DNA sequence and a large database of other DNA sequences (E.H. Chi et al., 1995). Similarity algorithms generate similarity information in textual reports that can be hundreds or thousands of pages long. Our original system visualized the most important variables from these reports. However, the biologists we work with found this system so useful they requested visual representations of other variables. We present an enhanced system for interactive exploration of this multivariate data. We identify a larger set of useful variables in the information space. The new system involves more variables, so it focuses on exploring subsets of the data. We present an interactive system allowing mapping of different variables to different axes, incorporating animation using a time axis, and providing tools for viewing subsets of the data. Detail-on-demand is preserved by hyperlinks to the analysis reports. We present three case studies illustrating the use of these techniques. The combined technique of applying a time axis with a 3D scatter plot and query filters to visualization of biological sequence similarity data is both powerful and novel.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567796/","LOCKED","567796","Dept. of Comput.

"Many scientific and medical visualization techniques produce irregular surfaces whose shape and structure need to be understood. Examples include tissue and tumor boundaries in medical imaging, molecular surfaces and force thresholds in chemical and pharmaceutical applications, and isosurfaces in a wide range of 3D domains. The 3D shape of such surfaces can be particularly difficult to interpret because of the unfamiliar, irregular shapes, the potential concavities and bulges, and the lack of parallel lines and right angles to provide perspective depth cues. Attempts to display multiple irregular surfaces by making some or all of them transparent further complicates the problem. Texture can provide valuable cues to aid in the interpretation of irregular surfaces. Opacity-modulating textures offer a mechanism for the display of multiple surfaces without the extreme loss of clarity of multiple transparent surfaces. This paper presents a method for creating simple repeating textures and mapping them onto irregular surfaces.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568111/","LOCKED","568111","Dept. of Comput.

"This paper describes a minimally immersive interactive system for visualization of multivariate volumetric data. The system, SFA, uses glyph-based volume rendering which does not suffer the initial costs of isosurface rendering or voxel-based volume rendering, while offering the capability of viewing the entire volume. Glyph rendering also allows the simultaneous display of multiple data values per volume location. Two-handed interaction using three-space magnetic trackers and stereoscopic viewing are combined to produce a minimally immersive volumetric visualization system that enhances the user's three-dimensional perception of the data. We describe the usefulness of this system for visualizing volumetric scalar and vector data. SFA allows the three-dimensional volumetric visualization, manipulation, navigation, and analysis of multivariate, time-varying volumetric data, increasing the quantity and clarity of the information conveyed from the visualization system.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568109/","LOCKED","568109","Maryland Univ., Baltimore, MD, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282598900","1","D.S.

"Real time rendering of iso contour surfaces is problematic for large complex data sets. An algorithm is presented that allows very rapid representation of an interval set surrounding an iso contour surface. The algorithm draws upon three main ideas. A fast indexing scheme is used to select only those data points near the contour surface. Hardware assisted splatting is then employed on these data points to produce a volume rendering of the interval set. Finally, by shifting a small window through the indexing scheme or data space, animated volumes are produced showing the changing contour values. In addition to allowing fast selection and rendering of the data, the indexing scheme allows a much compressed representation of the data by eliminating ""noise"" data points.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568119/","LOCKED","568119","Lawrence Livermore Nat.

"A technique is presented for the layout of high dimensional data in a low dimensional space. This technique builds upon the force based methods that have been used previously to make visualisations of various types of data such as bibliographies and sets of software modules. The canonical force based model, related to solutions of the N body problem, has a computational complexity of O(N/sup 2/) per iteration. The paper presents a stochastically based algorithm of linear complexity per iteration which produces good layouts, has low overhead, and is easy to implement. Its performance and accuracy are discussed, in particular with regard to the data to which it is applied. Experience with application to bibliographic and time series data, which may have a dimensionality in the tens of thousands, is described.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567787/","LOCKED","567787","Union Bank of Switzerland, Switzerland","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283487400","1","M.

"The marching cubes (MC) algorithm is a method for generating isosurfaces. It also generates an excessively large number of triangles to represent an isosurface; this increases the rendering time. This paper presents a decimation method to reduce the number of triangles generated. Decimation is carried out before creating a large number of triangles. Four major steps comprise the algorithm: surface tracking, merging, crack patching and triangulation. Surface tracking is an enhanced implementation of the MC algorithm. Starting from a seed point, the surface tracker visits only those cells likely to compose part of the desired isosurface. The cells making up the extracted surface are stored in an octree that is further processed. A bottom-up approach is taken in merging the cells containing a relatively flat approximating surface. The finer surface details are maintained. Cells are merged as long as the error due to such an operation is within a user-specified error parameter, or a cell acquires more than one connected surface component in it. A crack patching method is described that forces edges of smaller cells to lie along those of the larger neighboring cells. The overall saving in the number of triangles depends both on the specified error value and the nature of the data. Use of the hierarchical octree data structure also presents the potential of incremental representation of surfaces. We can generate a highly smoothed surface representation which can be progressively refined as the user-specified error value is decreased.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568127/","LOCKED","568127","Biomed.

"Whilst there has been considerable effort in constructing force feedback devices for use in virtual environments, and in the use of touch as a prosthesis for the blind, there has been little work on the use of touch in the visualisation or more properly, perceptualisation of data. Touch potentially offers an additional dimension of perception where visualisation is limited by screen size, resolution, and visual overload. We describe some tactile mice and experiments in using tactile mice for a variety of perceptualisation tasks.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568104/","LOCKED","568104","Sch. of Inf.

"Transparency can be a useful device for simultaneously depicting multiple superimposed layers of information in a single image. However, in computer-generated pictures-as in photographs and in directly viewed actual objects-it can often be difficult to adequately perceive the three-dimensional shape of a layered transparent surface or its relative depth distance from underlying structures. Inspired by artists' use of line to show shape, we have explored methods for automatically defining a distributed set of opaque surface markings that intend to portray the three-dimensional shape and relative depth of a smoothly curving layered transparent surface in an intuitively meaningful (and minimally occluding) way. This paper describes the perceptual motivation, artistic inspiration and practical implementation of an algorithm for ""texturing"" a transparent surface with uniformly distributed opaque short strokes, locally oriented in the direction of greatest normal curvature, and of length proportional to the magnitude of the surface curvature in the stroke direction. The driving application for this work is the visualization of layered surfaces in radiation therapy treatment planning data, and the technique is illustrated on transparent isointensity surfaces of radiation dose.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568110/","LOCKED","568110","ICASE, NASA Langley Res.

"Volume visualization techniques typically provide support for visual exploration of data, however additional information can be conveyed by allowing a user to see as well as feel virtual objects. We present a haptic interaction method that is suitable for both volume visualization and modeling applications. Point contact forces are computed directly from the volume data and are consistent with the isosurface and volume rendering methods, providing a strong correspondence between visual and haptic feedback. Virtual tools are simulated by applying three-dimensional filters to some properties of the data within the extent of the tool, and interactive visual feedback rates are obtained by using an accelerated ray casting method. This haptic interaction method was implemented using a PHANToM haptic interface.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568108/","LOCKED","568108","Gen. Electr. Corp. Res. & Dev.

"Anatomy-based facial tissue modeling for surgical simulation is a field whose time has come. Real-time facial animation has been created in the last few years using models based on the anatomical structure of the human skin. Anatomy-based models are also under development in the field of medical visualization, with which facial surgery can be realistically simulated. In this article, we present an anatomy-based 3D finite element tissue model. Integrated into a computer-aided surgical planning system, this model allows the precise prediction of soft tissue changes resulting from the realignment of the underlying bone structure. The model has already been used in our Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and has improved craniofacial surgical planning procedures. The model is described in detail, and surgical simulation results are shown and discussed.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567595/","LOCKED","567595","Telecommun.

"We are investigating methods for simplifying complex models for interactive visualizations using texture based representations. The paper presents a simplification method which dynamically ""caches"" distant geometry into textures and trades off accurate rendering of the distant geometry for performance. Smooth transitions and continuous borders are defined between the geometry and textures thus the representations can be switched without sudden jumps (as is the case with many current texturing techniques). All the computations for the transitions can be done a priori without the need to change the textures each frame thereafter.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567774/","LOCKED","567774","Dept. of Comput.

"We present a method for producing real-time volume visualizations of continuously captured, arbitrarily-oriented 2D arrays (slices) of data. Our system constructs a 3D representation on-the-fly from incoming 2D ultrasound slices by modeling and rendering the slices as planar polygons with translucent surface textures. We use binary space partition (BSP) tree data structures to provide non-intersecting, visibility-ordered primitives for accurate opacity accumulation images. New in our system is a method of using parallel, time-shifted BSP trees to efficiently manage the continuously captured ultrasound data and to decrease the variability in image generation time between output frames. This technique is employed in a functioning real-time augmented reality system that a physician has used to examine human patients prior to breast biopsy procedures. We expect the technique can be used for real-time visualization of any 2D data being collected from a tracked sensor moving along an arbitrary path.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568114/","LOCKED","568114","Dept. of Comput.

"Direct Volume Rendering (DVR) allows the holistic visualization of huge volumetric data sets in a single image. Computational fluid dynamics data is in principle well suited for DVR. But efficient mappings of the directional information of vector fields are still to be found. We investigate how the raycasting technique can be used to directly render vector fields. Our approach is based on the perception that other flow visualization techniques use visualization objects that are locally tangential to the vector field together with directed light sources. From this, we developed the idea to shade streamlines at sampling points when raycasting a vector field. We extended this approach further to more abstract mappings where pseudo color is used. Combining opacity mapping, pseudo color mapping, and streamline shading we can express flow speed and flow direction together in one single image.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567780/","LOCKED","567780","Fraunhofer Inst. for Comput.

"As the amount of electronic information explodes, hierarchies to handle this information become huge and complex. Visualizing and interacting with these hierarchies become daunting tasks. The problem is exacerbated if the visualization is to be done on mass-market personal computers, with limited processing power and visual resolution. Many of the current visualization techniques work effectively for hierarchies of 1000 nodes, but as the number of nodes increases toward 5000, these techniques tend to break down. Hierarchies above 5000 nodes usually require special modifications such as clustering, which can affect visual stability. This paper introduces Cheops, a novel approach to the representation, browsing and exploration of huge, complex information hierarchies such as the Dewey Decimal Classification system, which can contain between a million and a billion nodes. The Cheops approach maintains context within a huge hierarchy, while simultaneously providing easy access to details. This paper presents some preliminary results from usability tests performed on an 8-wide-by-9-deep classification hierarchy, which if fully populated would contain over 19 million nodes.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567745/","LOCKED","567745","Centre de Recherche Inf. de Montreal, Que., Canada","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37852878400","1","L.

"We propose to fit triangular NURBS surfaces to noisy, sparse, scattered 3D data while simultaneously localizing and preserving sharp edges. We use a vector voting method to interpolate, from sparse data, three dense potential fields for surfaces, edges, and junctions. The global voting interpolants encode several human perceptual grouping principles such as cosurfacity, proximity, and constancy of curvature. The inferred potential fields are stored in three volumetric grids, giving each voxel the probability of being a surface point, an edge point, and a junction point. Then we use a new model called ""winged B snakes"", which are deformable triangular NURBS surfaces embedded with active curves, to fit the surfaces and align the edges and junctions. Finally, a smooth C/sup 1/ surface which preserves discontinuity edges and junctions is constructed. Fine tuning and surface fairing is done by adjusting the weights.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568122/","LOCKED","568122","Inst. for Robotics & Intelligent Syst., Univ. of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA","","1","Song Han","","","","","","","","2","G.

"Explores the way in which data visualization systems, in particular modular visualization environments, can be used over the World Wide Web. The conventional approach is for the publisher of the data also to be responsible for creating the visualization, and posting it as an image on the Web. This leaves the viewer in a passive role, with no opportunity to analyse the data in any way. We look at different scenarios that occur as we transfer more responsibility for the creation of the visualization to the viewer, allowing visualization to be used for analysis as well as presentation. We have implemented one particular scenario, where the publisher mounts the raw data on the Web, and the viewer accesses this data through a modular visualization environment-in this case, IRIS Explorer. The visualization system is hosted by the publisher, but its fine control is the responsibility of the viewer. The picture is returned to the viewer as VRML, for exploration via a VRML viewer such as Webspace. We have applied this to air quality data which is posted on the Web hourly: through our system, the viewer selects what data to look at (e.g. species of pollutant, location, time period) and how to look at it-at any time and from anywhere on the Web.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567610/","LOCKED","567610","Leeds Univ., UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273103500","1","J.

"Volume ray casting is based on sampling the data along sight rays. In this technique, reconstruction is achieved by a convolution, which collects the contribution of multiple voxels to one sample point. Splatting, on the other hand, is based on projecting data points on to the screen, and reconstruction is implemented by an ""inverted convolution"", where the contribution of one data element is distributed to many sample points (i.e. pixels). Splatting produces images of a quality comparable to ray casting but at greater speeds. This is achieved by pre-computing the projection footprint that the interpolation kernel leaves on the image plane. However, while fast incremental schemes can be utilized for orthographic projection, the perspective projection complicates the mapping of the footprints and is therefore rather slow. In this paper, we merge the technique of splatting with the principles of ray casting to yield a ray-driven splatting approach. We imagine splats as being suspended in object space, a splat at every voxel. Rays are then spawned to traverse the space and intersect the splats. An efficient and accurate way of intersecting and addressing the splats is described. Not only is ray-driven splatting inherently insensitive to the complexity of the perspective viewing transform, it also offers acceleration methods such as early ray termination and bounding volumes, which are methods that traditional voxel-driven splatting cannot benefit from. This results in competitive or superior performance for parallel projection, and superior performance for perspective projection.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567608/","LOCKED","567608","Biomed.

"The Virtual Workbench (VW) is a non-immersive virtual environment that allows users to view and interact with stereoscopic objects displayed on a workspace similar to a tabletop workspace used in day-to-day life. A VW is an ideal environment for collaborative work where several colleagues can gather around the table to study 3D virtual objects. The Virtual Reality laboratory at the Naval Research Laboratory has implemented the VW using a concept similar to (Froehlich et al., 1994). This paper investigates how the VW can be used as a non-immersive display device for understanding and interpreting complex objects encountered in the scientific visualization field. Different techniques for interacting with 3D visualization objects on the table and using VW as a display device for visualization are evaluated using several cases.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568128/","LOCKED","568128","Naval Res.
