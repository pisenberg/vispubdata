"We introduce a semantically zoomable interface that displays emails as interactive objects rather than files containing lines of text, as in traditional e-mail interfaces. In this system, e-mails are displayed as node objects called e-mail nodes within a 2.5-dimensional world. The e-mail nodes are semantically zoomable and each may be rearranged to different locations within the plane to organize threads, topics, or projects. The prototype for this system was built using the Piccolo toolkit, the successor of Pad++ and Jazz [2, 3].","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382917/","LOCKED","1382917","Tufts University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37939704200","1","E.

"ARNA is an interactive visualization system that supports comparison and alignment of RNA secondary structure. We present a new approach to RNA alignment that exploits the complex structure of the Smith-Waterman local distance matrix, allowing people to explore the space of possible partial alignments to discover a good global solution. The modular software architecture separates the user interface from computation, allowing the possibility of incorporating different alignment algorithms into the same framework.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382919/","LOCKED","1382919","University of Bordeaux 1","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37938693800","1","G.

"Data repositories around the world hold many thousands of data sets. Finding information from these data sets is greatly facilitated by being able to quickly and efficiently browse remote data sets. In this note, we introduce the Iconic Remote Visual Data Exploration tool(IRVDX), which is a visual data mining tool used for exploring the features of remote and distributed data without the necessity of downloading the entire data set. IRVDX employs three kinds of visualizations: one provides a reduced representation of the data sets, which we call Dataset Icons. These icons show the important statistical characteristics of data sets and help to identify relevant data sets from distributed repositories. Another one is called the Remote Dataset Visual Browser that provides visualizations to browse remote data without downloading the complete data set to identify its content. The final one provides visualizations to show the degree of similarity between two data sets and to visually determine whether a join of two remote data sets will be meaningful.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382923/","LOCKED","1382923","University of Illinois at Chicago","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37936804400","1","P.

"Email has developed into one of the most extensively used computer applications. Email interfaces, on the other hand, have gone through very few transformations since their inception, and as the growing volumes of email data accumulate in users' email boxes, these interfaces fail to provide effective message handling and browsing support. Saved email messages provide not only a vast record of one's electronic past, but also a potential source of valuable insights into the structure and dynamics of one's social network. In this paper, we present faMailiar, a novel email visualization that draws upon email's inherently personal character by using intimacy as a key visualization parameter. The program presents a visualization of email use over time. faMailiar facilitates navigation through large email collections, enabling the user to discover communication rhythms and patterns.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382925/","LOCKED","1382925","Texas A&M University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37925992500","1","M.

"A standard method of visualizing high-dimensional data is reducing its dimensionality to two or three using some algorithm, and then creating a scatterplot with data represented by labelled and/or colored dots. Two problems with this approach are (1) dots do not represent data well, (2) reducing to just three dimensions does not make full use of several dimensionality-reduction algorithms. We demonstrate how Partiview can be used to solve these problems, in the context of handwriting recognition and image retrieval.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382931/","LOCKED","1382931","University of Chicago","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37939591100","1","D.

"This paper addresses the problem of how to enable users to visually explore and compare large sets of documents that have been retrieved by different search engines or queries. The Rank-Spiral enables users to rapidly scan large numbers of documents and their titles in a single screen. It uses a spiral mapping that maximizes information density and minimizes occlusions. It solves the labeling problem by exploiting the structure of the special spiral mapping used. Focus+Context interactions enable users to examine document clusters or groupings in more detail.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382929/","LOCKED","1382929","Rutgers University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283017700","1","A.

"Intelligence analysts receive thousands of facts from a variety of sources. In addition to the bare details of the fact — a particular person, for example — each fact may have provenance, reliability, weight, and other attributes. Each fact may also be associated with other facts, e.g. that one person met another at a particular location. The analyst’s task is to examine a huge collection of such loosely-structured facts, and try to ""connect the dots"" to perceive the underlying and unknown causes — and their possible future courses. We have designed and implemented a Java platform called VIM to support intelligence analysts in their work.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382933/","LOCKED","1382933","Visintuit LLC","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349418300","1","T.A.

Tulip supports interactive navigation and many options for layout. Subgraphs of the full dataset can be created interactively or using a wide set of algorithms based on graph theory and combinatorics, including several kinds of clustering.

"In today's fast-paced world it is becoming increasingly difficult to stay abreast of the public discourse. With the advent of hundreds of closed-captioned cable channels and internet-based channels such as news feeds, blogs, or email, knowing the ""buzz"" is a particular challenge. TextPool addresses this problem by quickly summarizing recent content in live text streams. The summarization is a dynamically changing textual collage that clusters related terms. We tested TextPool with the content of several RSS newswire feeds, which are updated roughly every five minutes. TextPool was able to handle this bandwidth well, and produced useful summarizations of feed content.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382912/","LOCKED","1382912","Northwestern University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38275875000","1","C.

"A digital lens is a user interface mechanism that is a potential solution to information mangement problems. We investigated the use of digital lensing applied to imagery analysis. Participants completed three different types of tasks (locate, follow, and compare) using a magnification lens with three different degrees of offset (aligned, adjacent, and docked) over a high-resolution aerial photo. Although no lens offset mode was significantly better than another, most participants preferred the adjacent mode for the locate and compare tasks, and the docked mode for the follow tasks. This paper describes the results of a user study of magnification lenses and provides new insights into preferences of and interactions with digital lensing.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382916/","LOCKED","1382916","The Mitre Corporation","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37929365500","1","E.

"Managing file systems of large organizations can present significant challenges in terms of the number of users, shared access to parts of the file system, and securing and monitoring critical parts of the file system. We present an interactive exploratory tool for monitoring and viewing the complex relationships within the Andrews File System (AFS). This tool is targeted as an aid to system administrators to manage users, applications and shared access. We tested our tool on UNC Charlotte’s Andrews File System (AFS) file system, which contains 4554 users, 556 user groups, and 2.2 million directories. Two types of visualizations are supported to explore file system relationships. In addition, drill-down features are provided to access the user file system and access control information of any directory within the system. All of the views are linked to facilitate easy navigation.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382918/","LOCKED","1382918","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37927235100","1","J.

"This paper describes the integration of lookmarks into the ParaView visualization tool. Lookmarks are pointers to views of specific parts of a dataset. They were so named because lookmarks are to a visualization tool and dataset as bookmarks are to a browser and the World Wide Web. A lookmark can be saved and organized among other lookmarks within the context of ParaView. Then at a later time, either in the same ParaView session or in a different one, it can be regenerated, displaying the exact view of the data that had previously been saved. This allows the user to pick up where they left off, to continue to adjust the view or otherwise manipulate the data. Lookmarks facilitate collaboration between users who wish to share views of a dataset. They enable more effective data comparison because they can be applied to other datasets. They also serve as a way of organizing a user’s data. Ultimately, a lookmark is a time-saving tool that automates the recreation of a complex view of the data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382930/","LOCKED","1382930","Sandia National Laboratories","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37931637200","1","E.T.

"Visualization systems must intuitively display and allow interaction with large multivariate data on low-dimensional displays. One problem often encountered in the process is occlusion: the ambiguity that occurs when records from different data sets are mapped to the same display location. For example, because of occlusion summarizing 1000 graphs by simply stacking them one over another is pointless. We solve this problem by adapting the solution to a similar problem in the Information Murals system [2]: mapping the number of data elements at a location to display luminance. Inspired by histograms, which map data frequency to space, we call our solution histographs. By treating a histograph as a digital image, we can blur and highlight edges to emphasize data features. We also support interactive clustering of the data with data zooming and shape-based selection. We are currently investigating alternative occlusion blending schemes.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382928/","LOCKED","1382928","Northwestern University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564433400","1","Pin Ren","37564433400","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37356872100","2","B.

"Many fields of study produce time series datasets, and both the size and number of theses datasets are increasing rapidly due to the improvement of data accumulation methods such as small, cheap sensors and routine logging of events. Humans often fail to comprehend the structure of a long time series dataset because of the overwhelming amount of data and the range of different time scales at which there may be meaningful patterns.

"Analyzing observations over time and geography is a common task but typically requires multiple, separate tools. The objective of our research has been to develop a method to visualize, and work with, the spatial interconnectedness of information over time and geography within a single, highly interactive 3D view. A novel visualization technique for displaying and tracking events, objects and activities within a combined temporal and geospatial display has been developed. This technique has been implemented as a demonstratable prototype called GeoTime in order to determine potential utility. Initial evaluations have been with military users.

"Current implementations of multidimensional scaling (MDS), an approach that attempts to best represent data point similarity in a low-dimensional representation, are not suited for many of today's large-scale datasets. We propose an extension to the spring model approach that allows the user to interactively explore datasets that are far beyond the scale of previous implementations of MDS. We present MDSteer, a steerable MDS computation engine and visualization tool that progressively computes an MDS layout and handles datasets of over one million points. Our technique employs hierarchical data structures and progressive layouts to allow the user to steer the computation of the algorithm to the interesting areas of the dataset. The algorithm iteratively alternates between a layout stage in which a subselection of points are added to the set of active points affected by the MDS iteration, and a binning stage which increases the depth of the bin hierarchy and organizes the currently unplaced points into separate spatial regions. This binning strategy allows the user to select onscreen regions of the layout to focus the MDS computation into the areas of the dataset that are assigned to the selected bins. We show both real and common synthetic benchmark datasets with dimensionalities ranging from 3 to 300 and cardinalities of over one million points","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382891/","LOCKED","1382891","University of British Columbia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37926388300","1","M.

"Traditional multidimensional visualization techniques, such as glyphs, parallel coordinates and scatterplot matrices, suffer from clutter at the display level and difficult user navigation among dimensions when visualizing high dimensional datasets. In this paper, we propose a new multidimensional visualization technique named a value and relation (VaR) display, together with a rich set of navigation and selection tools, for interactive exploration of datasets with up to hundreds of dimensions. By explicitly conveying the relationships among the dimensions of a high dimensional dataset, the VaR display helps users grasp the associations among dimensions. By using pixel-oriented techniques to present values of the data items in a condensed manner, the VaR display reveals data patterns in the dataset using as little screen space as possible. The navigation and selection tools enable users to interactively reduce clutter, navigate within the dimension space, and examine data value details within context effectively and efficiently. The VaR display scales well to datasets with large numbers of data items by employing sampling and texture mapping. A case study on a real dataset, as well as the VaR displays of multiple real datasets throughout the paper, reveals how our proposed approach helps users interactively explore high dimensional datasets with large numbers of data items","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382893/","LOCKED","1382893","Worcester Polytechnic Institute","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37292632600","1","Jing Yang","37292632600","Dept. of Comput.

"Visual clutter denotes a disordered collection of graphical entities in information visualization. Clutter can obscure the structure present in the data. Even in a small dataset, clutter can make it hard for the viewer to find patterns, relationships and structure. In this paper, we define visual clutter as any aspect of the visualization that interferes with the viewer's understanding of the data, and present the concept of clutter-based dimension reordering. Dimension order is an attribute that can significantly affect a visualization's expressiveness. By varying the dimension order in a display, it is possible to reduce clutter without reducing information content or modifying the data in any way. Clutter reduction is a display-dependent task. In this paper, we follow a three-step procedure for four different visualization techniques. For each display technique, first, we determine what constitutes clutter in terms of display properties; then we design a metric to measure visual clutter in this display; finally we search for an order that minimizes the clutter in a display","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382895/","LOCKED","1382895","Worcester Polytechnic Institute","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37929204000","1","Wei Peng","37929204000","Dept. of Comput.

"The InfoSky visual explorer is a system enabling users to interactively explore large, hierarchically structured document collections. Similar to a real-world telescope, InfoSky employs a planar graphical representation with variable magnification. Documents of similar content are placed close to each other and displayed as stars, while collections of documents at a particular level in the hierarchy are visualised as bounding polygons. Usability testing of an early prototype implementation of InfoSky revealed several design issues which prevented users from fully exploiting the power of the visual metaphor. Evaluation results have been incorporated into an advanced prototype, and another usability test has been conducted. A comparison of test results demonstrates enhanced system performance and points out promising directions for further work","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382900/","LOCKED","1382900","Know-Center","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37394939100","1","M.

"Many tree browsers allow subtrees under a node to be collapsed or expanded, enabling the user to control screen space usage and selectively drill-down. However, explicit expansion of nodes can be tedious. Expand-ahead is a space-filling strategy by which some nodes are automatically expanded to fill available screen space, without expanding so far that nodes are shown at a reduced size or outside the viewport. This often allows a user exploring the tree to see further down the tree without the effort required in a traditional browser. It also means the user can sometimes drill-down a path faster, by skipping over levels of the tree that are automatically expanded for them. Expand-ahead differs from many detail-in-context techniques in that there is no scaling or distortion involved. We present 1D and 2D prototype implementations of expand-ahead, and identify various design issues and possible enhancements to our designs. Our prototypes support smooth, animated transitions between different views of a tree. We also present the results of a controlled experiment which show that, under certain conditions, users are able to drill-down faster with expand-ahead than without","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382899/","LOCKED","1382899","University of Toronto","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38526446600","1","M.J.

"The design and evaluation of most current information visualization systems descend from an emphasis on a user's ability to ""unpack"" the representations of data of interest and operate on them independently. Too often, successful decision-making and analysis are more a matter of serendipity and user experience than of intentional design and specific support for such tasks; although humans have considerable abilities in analyzing relationships from data, the utility of visualizations remains relatively variable across users, data sets, and domains. In this paper, we discuss the notion of analytic gaps, which represent obstacles faced by visualizations in facilitating higher-level analytic tasks, such as decision-making and learning. We discuss support for bridging the analytic gap, propose a framework for design and evaluation of information visualization systems, and demonstrate its use","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382902/","LOCKED","1382902","Georgia Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37418696100","1","R.

"Improvise is a fully-implemented system in which users build and browse multiview visualizations interactively using a simple shared-object coordination mechanism coupled with a flexible, expression-based visual abstraction language. By coupling visual abstraction with coordination, users gain precise control over how navigation and selection in the visualization affects the appearance of data in individual views. As a result, it is practical to build visualizations with more views and richer coordination in Improvise than in other visualization systems. Building and browsing activities are integrated in a single, live user interface that lets users alter visualizations quickly and incrementally during data exploration","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382904/","LOCKED","1382904","University of Wisconsin-Madison","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564883300","1","C.

"Graph drawing is a basic visualization tool. For graphs of up to hundreds of nodes and edges, there are many effective techniques available. At greater scale, data density and occlusion problems often negate its effectiveness. Conventional pan-and-zoom, and multiscale and geometric fisheye views are not fully satisfactory solutions to this problem. As an alternative, we describe a topological zooming method. It is based on the precomputation of a hierarchy of coarsened graphs, which are combined on the fly into renderings with the level of detail dependent on the distance from one or more foci. We also discuss a related distortion method that allows our technique to achieve constant information density displays","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382906/","LOCKED","1382906","AT&T Labs","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37299368000","1","E.

It differs from previous work on dynamic graph drawing in the emphasis that is put on maintaining the clustered structure of the graph during incremental layout. The algorithm works online and allows arbitrary modifications to the graph. It is generic and can be implemented using a wide range of static force-directed graph layout tools. The paper introduces several metrics for measuring layout quality of dynamic clustered graphs. The performance of our algorithm is analyzed using these metrics.

"High-throughput experiments such as gene expression microarrays in the life sciences result in large datasets. In response, a wide variety of visualization tools have been created to facilitate data analysis. Biologists often face a dilemma in choosing the best tool for their situation. The tool that works best for one biologist may not work well for another due to differences in the type of insight they seek from their data. A primary purpose of a visualization tool is to provide domain-relevant insight into the data. Ideally, any user wants maximum information in the least possible time. In this paper we identify several distinct characteristics of insight that enable us to recognize and quantify it. Based on this, we empirically evaluate five popular microarray visualization tools. Our conclusions can guide biologists in selecting the best tool for their data, and computer scientists in developing and evaluating visualizations","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382884/","LOCKED","1382884","Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37419557200","1","P.

This evaluation bears on seven generic tasks and leads to important recommendations with regard to the representation of graphs according to their size and density. For instance, we show that when graphs are bigger than twenty vertices, the matrix-based visualization performs better than node-link diagrams on most tasks.

"A major challenge of current visualization and visual data mining (VDM) frameworks is to support users in the orientation in complex visual mining scenarios. An important aspect to increase user support and user orientation is to use a history mechanism that, first of all, provides un- and redoing functionality. In this paper, we present a new approach to include such history functionality into a VDM framework. Therefore, we introduce the theoretical background, outline design and implementation aspects of a history management unit, and conclude with a discussion showing the usefulness of our history management in a VDM framework","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382890/","LOCKED","1382890","SD Industries GmbH","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37938665500","1","M.

"In many application domains, data is collected and referenced by its geospatial location. Nowadays, different kinds of maps are used to emphasize the spatial distribution of one or more geospatial attributes. The nature of geospatial statistical data is the highly nonuniform distribution in the real world data sets. This has several impacts on the resulting map visualizations. Classical area maps tend to highlight patterns in large areas, which may, however, be of low importance. Cartographers and geographers used cartograms or value-by-area maps to address this problem long before computers were available. Although many automatic techniques have been developed, most of the value-by-area cartograms are generated manually via human interaction. In this paper, we propose a novel visualization technique for geospatial data sets called RecMap. Our technique approximates a rectangular partition of the (rectangular) display area into a number of map regions preserving important geospatial constraints. It is a fully automatic technique with explicit user control over all exploration constraints within the exploration process. Experiments show that our technique produces visualizations of geospatial data sets, which enhance the discovery of global and local correlations, and demonstrate its performance in a variety of applications","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382888/","LOCKED","1382888","Bayer Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37943636700","1","R.

"Exploratory analysis of multidimensional data sets is challenging because of the difficulty in comprehending more than three dimensions. Two fundamental statistical principles for the exploratory analysis are (1) to examine each dimension first and then find relationships among dimensions, and (2) to try graphical displays first and then find numerical summaries (D.S. Moore, (1999). We implement these principles in a novel conceptual framework called the rank-by-feature framework. In the framework, users can choose a ranking criterion interesting to them and sort 1D or 2D axis-parallel projections according to the criterion. We introduce the rank-by-feature prism that is a color-coded lower-triangular matrix that guides users to desired features. Statistical graphs (histogram, boxplot, and scatterplot) and information visualization techniques (overview, coordination, and dynamic query) are combined to help users effectively traverse 1D and 2D axis-parallel projections, and finally to help them interactively find interesting features","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382892/","LOCKED","1382892","University of Maryland at College Park","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37422552700","1","Jinwook Seo","37422552700","Dept. of Comput.

"The one-to-one strategy of mapping each single data item into a graphical marker adopted in many visualization techniques has limited usefulness when the number of records and/or the dimensionality of the data set are very high. In this situation, the strong overlapping of graphical markers severely hampers the user's ability to identify patterns in the data from its visual representation. We tackle this problem here with a strategy that computes frequency or density information from the data set, and uses such information in parallel coordinates visualizations to filter out the information to be presented to the user, thus reducing visual clutter and allowing the analyst to observe relevant patterns in the data. The algorithms to construct such visualizations, and the interaction mechanisms supported, inspired by traditional image processing techniques such as grayscale manipulation and thresholding are also presented. We also illustrate how such algorithms can assist users to effectively identify clusters in very noisy large data sets","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382894/","LOCKED","1382894","University of São Paulo","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38256564300","1","A.O.

"This research demonstrates how principles of self-organization and behavior simulation can be used to represent dynamic data evolutions by extending the concept of information flocking, originally introduced by Proctor & Winter (1998), to time-varying datasets. A rule-based behavior system continuously controls and updates the dynamic actions of individual, three-dimensional elements that represent the changing data values of reoccurring data objects. As a result, different distinguishable motion types emerge that are driven by local interactions between the spatial elements as well as the evolution of time-varying data values. Notably, this representation technique focuses on the representation of dynamic data alteration characteristics, or how reoccurring data objects change over time, instead of depicting the exact data values themselves. In addition, it demonstrates the potential of motion as a useful information visualization cue. The original information flocking approach is extended to incorporate time-varying datasets, live database querying, continuous data streaming, real-time data similarity evaluation, automatic shape generation and more stable flocking algorithms. Different experiments prove that information flocking is capable of representing short-term events as well as long-term temporal data evolutions of both individual and groups of time-dependent data objects. An historical stock market quote price dataset is used to demonstrate the algorithms and principles of time-varying information flocking","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382896/","LOCKED","1382896","University of Sydney","","1","A.V.

"We describe an exploratory technique based on the direct interaction with a 2D modified scatterplot computed from two different metrics calculated over the elements of a network. The scatterplot is transformed into an image by applying standard image processing techniques resulting into blurring effects. Segmentation of the image allow to easily select patches on the image as a way to extract subnetworks. We were inspired by the work of Wattenberg and Fisher [M. Wattenberg et al. (2003)] showing that the blurring process builds into a multiscale perceptual scheme, making this type of interaction intuitive to the user. We explain how the exploration of the network can be guided by the visual analysis of the blurred scatterplot and by its possible interpretations","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382901/","LOCKED","1382901","Université du Québec à Chicoutimi","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282997400","1","Y.

"We present the novel high-level visualization taxonomy. Our taxonomy classifies visualization algorithms rather than data. Algorithms are categorized based on the assumptions they make about the data being visualized; we call this set of assumptions the design model. Because our taxonomy is based on design models, it is more flexible than existing taxonomies and considers the user's conceptual model, emphasizing the human aspect of visualization. Design models are classified according to whether they are discrete or continuous and by how much the algorithm designer chooses display attributes such as spatialization, timing, colour, and transparency. This novel approach provides an alternative view of the visualization field that helps explain how traditional divisions (e.g., information and scientific visualization) relates and overlap, and that may inspire research ideas in hybrid visualization areas","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382903/","LOCKED","1382903","Simon Fraser University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275861300","1","M.

"This article presents the InfoVis toolkit, designed to support the creation, extension and integration of advanced 2D information visualization components into interactive Java swing applications. The InfoVis toolkit provides specific data structures to achieve a fast action/feedback loop required by dynamic queries. It comes with a large set of components such as range sliders and tailored control panels required to control and configure the visualizations. These components are integrated into a coherent framework that simplifies the management of rich data structures and the design and extension of visualizations. Supported data structures currently include tables, trees and graphs. Supported visualizations include scatter plots, time series, parallel coordinates, treemaps, icicle trees, node-link diagrams for trees and graphs and adjacency matrices for graphs. All visualizations can use fisheye lenses and dynamic labeling. The InfoVis toolkit supports hardware acceleration when available through Agile2D, an implementation of the Java graphics API based on OpenGL, achieving speedups of 10 to 200 times. The article also shows how new visualizations can be added and extended to become components, enriching visualizations as well as general applications","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382905/","LOCKED","1382905","INRIA Futurs/LRI","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407972900","1","J.-D.

"In Web data, telecommunications traffic and in epidemiological studies, dense subgraphs correspond to subsets of subjects (i.e. users, patients) that share a collection of attributes values (i.e. accessed Web pages, email-calling patterns or disease diagnostic profiles). Visual and computational identification of these ""clusters"" becomes useful when domain experts desire to determine those factors of major influence in the formation of access and communication clusters or in the detection and contention of disease spread. With the current increases in graphic hardware capabilities and RAM sizes, it is more useful to relate graph sizes to the available screen real estate S and the amount of available RAM M, instead of the number of edges or nodes in the graph. We offer a visual interface that is parameterized by M and S and is particularly suited for navigation tasks that require the identification of subgraphs whose edge density is above certain threshold. This is achieved by providing a zoomable matrix view of the underlying data. This view is strongly coupled to a hierarchical view of the essential information elements present in the data domain. We illustrate the applicability of this work to the visual navigation of cancer incidence data and to an aggregated sample of phone call traffic","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382907/","LOCKED","1382907","Rutgers University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37662339600","1","J.

"Many real world graphs have small world characteristics, that is, they have a small diameter compared to the number of nodes and exhibit a local cluster structure. Examples are social networks, software structures, bibliographic references and biological neural nets. Their high connectivity makes both finding a pleasing layout and a suitable clustering hard. In this paper we present a method to create scalable, interactive visualizations of small world graphs, allowing the user to inspect local clusters while maintaining a global overview of the entire structure. The visualization method uses a combination of both semantical and geometrical distortions, while the layout is generated by a spring embedder algorithm using recently developed force model. We use a cross referenced database of 500 artists as a running example","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382909/","LOCKED","1382909","Technische Universiteit Eindhoven","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37326291000","1","F. van Ham","37326291000","Dept. of Math. & Comput.
