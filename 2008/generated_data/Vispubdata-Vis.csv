conference_external,2008,Geometry-Based Edge Clustering for Graph Visualization,10.1109/TVCG.2008.135,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2008.135,1277,1284,Journals,"Graphs have been widely used to model relationships among data. For large graphs, excessive edge crossings make the display visually cluttered and thus difficult to explore. In this paper, we propose a novel geometry-based edge-clustering framework that can group edges into bundles to reduce the overall edge crossings. Our method uses a control mesh to guide the edge-clustering process; edge bundles can be formed by forcing all edges to pass through some control points on the mesh. The control mesh can be generated at different levels of detail either manually or automatically based on underlying graph patterns. Users can further interact with the edge-clustering results through several advanced visualization techniques such as color and opacity enhancement. Compared with other edge-clustering methods, our approach is intuitive, flexible, and efficient. The experiments on some large graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",,Weiwei Cui;Hong Zhou;Huamin Qu;Pak Chung Wong;Xiaoming Li,the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology;the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology;the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology;Pacific Northwest National Laboratory;Peking University,,"Index Terms—,Graph visualization,,,visual clutter,mesh,edge clustering,,,,,",,154,,
Vis,2008,Color Design for Illustrative Visualization,10.1109/TVCG.2008.118,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2008.118,1739,1754,Journals,"Professional designers and artists are quite cognizant of the rules that guide the design of effective color palettes, from both aesthetic and attention-guiding points of view. In the field of visualization, however, the use of systematic rules embracing these aspects has received less attention. The situation is further complicated by the fact that visualization often uses semi-transparencies to reveal occluded objects, in which case the resulting color mixing effects add additional constraints to the choice of the color palette. Color design forms a crucial part in visual aesthetics. Thus, the consideration of these issues can be of great value in the emerging field of illustrative visualization. We describe a knowledge-based system that captures established color design rules into a comprehensive interactive framework, aimed to aid users in the selection of colors for scene objects and incorporating individual preferences, importance functions, and overall scene composition. Our framework also offers new knowledge and solutions for the mixing, ordering and choice of colors in the rendering of semi-transparent layers and surfaces. All design rules are evaluated via user studies, for which we extend the method of conjoint analysis to task-based testing scenarios. Our framework's use of principles rooted in color design with application for the illustration of features in pre-classified data distinguishes it from existing systems which target the exploration of continuous-range density data via perceptual color maps.",,Lujin Wang;Joachim Giesen;Kevin T.

When zoomed out, local trends and anomalies become suppressed and lost; when zoomed in for local inspection, spatial awareness and comparison between regions become limited. In our model, coordinated visualizations are integrated within individual probe interfaces, which depict the local data in user-defined regions-of-interest. Our probe concept can be incorporated into a variety of geospatial visualizations to empower users with the ability to observe, coordinate, and compare data across multiple local regions. It is especially useful when dealing with complex simulations or analyses where behavior in various localities differs from other localities and from the system as a whole. We illustrate the effectiveness of our technique over traditional interfaces by incorporating it within three existing geospatial visualization systems: an agent-based social simulation, a census data exploration tool, and an 3D GIS environment for analyzing urban change over time. In each case, the probe-based interaction enhances spatial awareness, improves inspection and comparison capabilities, expands the range of scopes, and facilitates collaboration among multiple users.",,Thomas Butkiewicz;Wenwen Dou;Zachary Wartell;William Ribarsky;Remco Chang,"The Charlotte Visualization Center, UNC Charlotte;The Charlotte Visualization Center, UNC Charlotte;The Charlotte Visualization Center, UNC Charlotte;The Charlotte Visualization Center, UNC Charlotte;The Charlotte Visualization Center, UNC Charlotte",,"Index Terms—,Multiple-view techniques,,,geospatial visualization,geospatial analysis,focus + context,probes,,,,",,26,,

However, the available tools for analyzing poll results often require specialized training. Hence, data analysis remains out of reach for many casual computer users. Moreover, the visualizations used to communicate the results of surveys are typically limited to traditional statistical graphics like bar graphs and pie charts, both of which are fundamentally noninteractive. We present a simple interactive visualization that allows users to construct queries on large tabular data sets, and view the results in real time. The results of two separate user studies suggest that our interface lowers the learning curve for naive users, while still providing enough analytical power to discover interesting correlations in the data.",,Geoffrey Draper;Richard Riesenfeld,University of Utah;University of Utah,,"Index Terms—,Visual query languages,,,radial visualization,data analysis,human-computer interaction,,,,,",,11,,

Sophisticated visualization tools help to gain insight. In this paper, we present a novel approach for the interactive comparison of scalar fields using isosurfaces, and its application to fluid flow datasets. Features in two scalar fields are defined by largest contour segmentation after topological simplification. These features are matched using a volumetric similarity measure based on spatial overlap of individual features. The relationships defined by this similarity measure are ranked and presented in a thumbnail gallery of feature pairs and a graph representation showing all relationships between individual contours. Additionally, linked views of the contour trees are provided to ease navigation. The main render view shows the selected features overlapping each other. Thus, by displaying individual features and their relationships in a structured fashion, we enable exploratory visualization of correlations between similar structures in two scalar fields. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by applying it to a number of complex fluid flow datasets, where the emphasis is put on the comparison of vortex related scalar quantities.",,Dominic Schneider;Alexander Wiebel;Hamish Carr;Mario Hlawitschka;Gerik Scheuermann,University of Leipzig;University of Leipzig;University College Dublin;University of Leipzig;University of Leipzig,,"Index Terms—,Scalar topology,,,comparative visualization,contour tree,largest contours,flow visualization,,,,",,45,,

However, the public nature of these locations requires special considerations concerning the design of information visualization in terms of visual representations and interaction techniques. We discuss the potential for, and challenges of, information visualization in the museum context based on our practical experience with EMDialog, an interactive information presentation that was part of the Emily Carr exhibition at the Glenbow Museum in Calgary. EMDialog visualizes the diverse and multi-faceted discourse about this Canadian artist with the goal to both inform and provoke discussion. It provides a visual exploration environment that offers interplay between two integrated visualizations, one for information access along temporal, and the other along contextual dimensions. We describe the results of an observational study we conducted at the museum that revealed the different ways visitors approached and interacted with EMDialog, as well as how they perceived this form of information presentation in the museum context. Our results include the need to present information in a manner sufficiently attractive to draw attention and the importance of rewarding passive observation as well as both short- and longer term information exploration.",,Uta Hinrichs;Holly Schmidt;Sheelagh Carpendale,"University of Calgary, Canada;;University of Calgary, Canada",,"Index Terms—,artistic information visualization,,,interactive information visualization,walk-up-and-use interaction,public displays.,,,,,",,49,,

We present Vispedia, a Web-based visualization system that reduces the cost of this data integration. Users can browse Wikipedia, select an interesting data table, then use a search interface to discover, integrate, and visualize additional columns of data drawn from multiple Wikipedia articles. This interaction is supported by a fast path search algorithm over DBpedia, a semantic graph extracted from Wikipedia's hyperlink structure. Vispedia can also export the augmented data tables produced for use in traditional visualization systems. We believe that these techniques begin to address the ""long tail"" of visualization by allowing a wider audience to visualize a broader class of data. We evaluated this system in a first-use formative lab study. Study participants were able to quickly create effective visualizations for a diverse set of domains, performing data integration as needed.",,Bryan Chan;Leslie Wu;Justin Talbot;Mike Cammarano;Pat Hanrahan,Stanford University;Stanford University;Stanford University;Stanford University;Stanford University,,"Index Terms—,information visualization,,,data integration,Wikipedia,semantic web,search interface,,,,",,22,,
Vis,2008,Sinus Endoscopy - Application of Advanced GPU Volume Rendering for Virtual Endoscopy,10.1109/TVCG.2008.161,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2008.161,1491,1498,Journals,"For difficult cases in endoscopic sinus surgery, a careful planning of the intervention is necessary. Due to the reduced field of view during the intervention, the surgeons have less information about the surrounding structures in the working area compared to open surgery. Virtual endoscopy enables the visualization of the operating field and additional information, such as risk structures (e.g., optical nerve and skull base) and target structures to be removed (e.g., mucosal swelling). The Sinus Endoscopy system provides the functional range of a virtual endoscopic system with special focus on a realistic representation. Furthermore, by using direct volume rendering, we avoid time-consuming segmentation steps for the use of individual patient datasets. However, the image quality of the endoscopic view can be adjusted in a way that a standard computer with a modern standard graphics card achieves interactive frame rates with low CPU utilization. Thereby, characteristics of the endoscopic view are systematically used for the optimization of the volume rendering speed. The system design was based on a careful analysis of the endoscopic sinus surgery and the resulting needs for computer support. As a small standalone application it can be instantly used for surgical planning and patient education. First results of a clinical evaluation with ENT surgeons were employed to fine-tune the user interface, in particular to reduce the number of controls by using appropriate default values wherever possible. The system was used for preoperative planning in 102 cases, provides useful information for intervention planning (e.g., anatomic variations of the Rec. Frontalis), and closely resembles the intraoperative situation.",,Arno Kruger;Christoph Kubisch;Bernhard Preim;Gero Strauss,"Department of Simulation and Graphics, Otto-von-Guericke-University of Magdeburg, Germany;Department of Simulation and Graphics, Otto-von-Guericke-University of Magdeburg, Germany;Department of Simulation and Graphics, Otto-von-Guericke-University of Magdeburg, Germany;ENT Department,University Hospital of Leipzig, Germany",,"Index Terms—,medical visualization,,,sinus surgery,operationplanning,virtual endoscopy,volume rendering,,,,",,27,,

They have been valuable tools for analysis and exploration of data sets of various kinds. Many conventional techniques, however, do not behave well when the number of dimensions is high, such as in the case of documents collections. Later approaches handle that shortcoming, but may cause too much clutter to allow flexible exploration to take place. In this work we present a novel hierarchical point placement technique that is capable of dealing with these problems. While good grouping and separation of data with high similarity is maintained without increasing computation cost, its hierarchical structure lends itself both to exploration in various levels of detail and to handling data in subsets, improving analysis capability and also allowing manipulation of larger data sets.",,Fernando V.

The standard approach for defect detection builds on region growing, which requires manually tuning parameters such as target ranges for density and size, variance, as well as the specification of seed points. If the results are not satisfactory, region growing must be performed again with different parameters. In contrast, our method allows interactive exploration of the parameter space, completely separated from region growing in an unattended pre-processing stage. The pre-computed feature volume tracks a feature size curve for each voxel over time, which is identified with the main region growing parameter such as variance. A novel 3D transfer function domain over (density, feature.size, time) allows for interactive exploration of feature classes. Features and feature size curves can also be explored individually, which helps with transfer function specification and allows coloring individual features and disabling features resulting from CT artifacts. Based on the classification obtained through exploration, the classified features can be quantified immediately.",,Markus Hadwiger;Fritz Laura;Christof Rezk-Salama;Thomas Höllt;Georg Geier;Thomas Pabel,"VRVis Research Center, Austria;VRVis Research Center, Austria;University of Siegen, Germany;VRVis Research Center, Austria;Austrian Foundry Research Institute;Austrian Foundry Research Institute",,"Index Terms—,Non-Destructive Testing,,,Multi-Dimensional Transfer Functions,Region Growing,Volume Rendering,,,,,",,39,,

The generation of such multimaterial models from measured data poses two unique challenges: first, the surfaces must be well-sampled with regular, efficient tessellations that are consistent across material boundaries; and second, the resulting meshes must respect the nonmanifold geometry of the multimaterial interfaces. This paper proposes a strategy for sampling and meshing multimaterial volumes using dynamic particle systems, including a novel, differentiable representation of the material junctions that allows the particle system to explicitly sample corners, edges, and surfaces of material intersections. The distributions of particles are controlled by fundamental sampling constraints, allowing Delaunay-based meshing algorithms to reliably extract watertight meshes of consistently high-quality.",,Miriah Meyer;Ross Whitaker;Robert M.

We now can access a third dimension corresponding to a broad electromagnetic spectrum with a wide range of allsky surveys; these surveys span frequency bands including long long wavelength radio, microwaves, very short X-rays, and gamma rays. These advances motivate us to study and examine multiwavelength visualization techniques to maximize our capabilities to visualize and exploit these informative image data sets. In this work, we begin with the processing of the data themselves, uniformizing the representations and units of raw data obtained from varied detector sources. Then we apply tools to map, convert, color-code, and format the multiwavelength data in forms useful for applications. We explore different visual representations for displaying the data, including such methods as textured image stacks, the horseshoe representation, and GPU-based volume visualization.

The process of understanding a visualization therefore involves an interaction between these external visual metaphors and the user's internal knowledge representations. To investigate this claim, we conducted an experiment to test the effects of visual metaphor and verbal metaphor on the understanding of tree visualizations. Participants answered simple data comprehension questions while viewing either a treemap or a node-link diagram. Questions were worded to reflect a verbal metaphor that was either compatible or incompatible with the visualization a participant was using. The results suggest that the visual metaphor indeed affects how a user derives information from a visualization. Additionally, we found that the degree to which a user is affected by the metaphor is strongly correlated with the user's ability to answer task questions correctly. These findings are a first step towards illuminating how visual metaphors shape user understanding, and have significant implications for the evaluation, application, and theory of visualization.",,Caroline Ziemkiewicz;Robert Kosara,UNC Charlotte;UNC Charlotte,,"Index Terms—,Cognition,,,visualization theory,metaphors,hierarchies,evaluation,,,,",,56,,

The user explores the network by changing the focal node in the detailed view or by changing the level of detail of a node or cluster. For scalability, fast force-based layout algorithms are used for the overview and the detailed view. However, using the same layout algorithm in both views is problematic since layout for the detailed view has different requirements to that in the overview. Here we present a model in which constrained graph layout algorithms are used for layout in the detailed view. This means the detailed view has high-quality layout including sophisticated edge routing and is customisable by the user who can add placement constraints on the layout. Scalability is still ensured since the slower layout techniques are only applied to the small subgraph shown in the detailed view. The main technical innovations are techniques to ensure that the overview and detailed view remain synchronized, and modifying constrained graph layout algorithms to support smooth, stable layout. The key innovation supporting stability are new dynamic graph layout algorithms that preserve the topology or structure of the network when the user changes the focus node or the level of detail by in situ semantic zooming.

We improve the annotation of seismic structures by applying novel illustrative rendering algorithms tailored to seismic data, such as deformed texturing and line and texture transfer functions. The illustrative rendering results in multi-attribute and scale invariant visualizations where features are represented clearly in both highly zoomed in and zoomed out views.

In recent work, we have developed an algorithm for vessel detection that examines the intensity profile around each voxel in an angiographic image and determines the likelihood that any given voxel belongs to a vessel; we term this the ""vesselness coefficient"" of the voxel. Our results show that our algorithm works particularly well for visualizing branch points in vessels. Compared to standard Hessian based techniques, which are fine-tuned to identify long cylindrical structures, our technique identifies branches and connections with other vessels. Using our computed vesselness coefficient, we explore a set of techniques for visualizing vasculature. Visualizing vessels is particularly challenging because not only is their position in space important for clinicians but it is also important to be able to resolve their spatial relationship. We applied visualization techniques that provide shape cues as well as depth cues to allow the viewer to differentiate between vessels that are closer from those that are farther. We use our computed vesselness coefficient to effectively visualize vasculature in both clinical neurovascular x-ray computed tomography based angiography images, as well as images from three different animal studies.

We thus have designed and conducted a two-part empirical study that examines how the use of common data transformation techniques impacts visualization quality, which in turn affects user task performance. Our first experiment studies the impact of data transformation on user performance in single-step, typical visual analytic tasks. The second experiment assesses the impact of data transformation in multi-step analytic tasks. Our results quantify the benefits of data transformation in both experiments. More importantly, our analyses reveal that (1) the benefits of data transformation vary significantly by task and by visualization, and (2) the use of data transformation depends on a user's interaction context.

In the case of epilepsy neurosurgery for example, these images are used to identify brain regions to guide intracranial electrode implantation and resection. Generally, such data is visualized using 2D slices and in some cases using a 3D volume rendering along with the functional imaging results. Visualizing the activation region effectively by still preserving sufficient surrounding brain regions for context is exceedingly important to neurologists and surgeons. We present novel interaction techniques for visualization of multimodal data to facilitate improved exploration and planning for neurosurgery. We extended the line widget from VTK to allow surgeons to control the shape of the region of the brain that they can visually crop away during exploration and surgery. We allow simple spherical, cubical, ellipsoidal and cylindrical (probe aligned cuts) for exploration purposes.

In Trendalyzer, animation together with interesting data and an engaging presenter helps the audience understand the results of an analysis of the data. It is less clear whether trend animation is effective for analysis. This paper proposes two alternative trend visualizations that use static depictions of trends: one which shows traces of all trends overlaid simultaneously in one display and a second that uses a small multiples display to show the trend traces side-by-side.

Results indicate that trend animation can be challenging to use even for presentations; while it is the fastest technique for presentation and participants find it enjoyable and exciting, it does lead to many participant errors. Animation is the least effective form for analysis; both static depictions of trends are significantly faster than animation, and the small multiples display is more accurate.",,George Robertson;Roland Fernandez;Danyel Fisher;Bongshin Lee;John Stasko,Microsoft Research;Microsoft Research;Microsoft Research;Microsoft Research;Georgia Institute of Technology,,"Index Terms—,Information visualization,,,animation,trends,design,experiment,,,,",,167,,

Since the popular diffusion tensor (DT-MRI) model is limited to voxels with a single fiber direction, a number of high angular resolution techniques have been proposed to provide information about more diverse fiber distributions. Two such approaches are Q-Ball imaging and spherical deconvolution, which produce orientation distribution functions (ODFs) on the sphere. For analysis and visualization, the maxima of these functions have been used as principal directions, even though the results are known to be biased in case of crossing fiber tracts. In this paper, we present a more reliable technique for extracting discrete orientations from continuous ODFs, which is based on decomposing their higher-order tensor representation into an isotropic component, several rank-1 terms, and a small residual. Comparing to ground truth in synthetic data shows that the novel method reduces bias and reliably reconstructs crossing fibers which are not resolved as individual maxima in the ODF We present results on both Q-Ball and spherical deconvolution data and demonstrate that the estimated directions allow for plausible fiber tracking in a real data set.",,Thomas Schultz;Hans-Peter Seidel,MPI Informatik;MPI Informatik,,"Index Terms—,DW-MRI,,,Q-Ball,spherical deconvolution,fiber tracking,higher-order tensor,tensor decomposition.,,,",,83,,

In this paper, we systematically study the extraction, representation,exploration, and visualization of spatial relations in volumetric data and propose a novel relation-aware visualization pipeline for volume exploration. In our pipeline, various relations in the volume are first defined and measured using region connection calculus (RCC) and then represented using a graph interface called relation graph. With RCC and the relation graph, relation query and interactive exploration can be conducted in a comprehensive and intuitive way.

In this paper we describe a successful realization of a tightly coupled steering loop, integrating new simulation technology and interactive visual analysis in a prototyping environment for automotive industry system design. Due to increasing pressure on car manufacturers to meet new emission regulations, to improve efficiency, and to reduce noise, both simulation and visualization are pushed to their limits. Automotive system components, such as the powertrain system or the injection system have an increasing number of parameters, and new design approaches are required. It is no longer possible to optimize such a system solely based on experience or forward optimization. By coupling interactive visualization with the simulation back-end (computational steering), it is now possible to quickly prototype a new system, starting from a non-optimized initial prototype and the corresponding simulation model. The prototyping continues through the refinement of the simulation model, of the simulation parameters and through trial-and-error attempts to an optimized solution. The ability to early see the first results from a multidimensional simulation space - thousands of simulations are run for a multidimensional variety of input parameters - and to quickly go back into the simulation and request more runs in particular parameter regions of interest significantly improves the prototyping process and provides a deeper understanding of the system behavior.

In this paper, we present techniques to enhance the usability of PCPs for the exploration of large, multi-timepoint volumetric data sets, containing tens of millions of points per timestep. The main difficulties that arise when applying PCPs to large numbers of data points are visual clutter and slow performance, making interactive exploration infeasible. Moreover, the spatial context of the volumetric data is usually lost. We describe techniques for preprocessing using data quantization and compression, and for fast GPU-based rendering of PCPs using joint density distributions for each pair of consecutive variables, resulting in a smooth, continuous visualization. Also, fast brushing techniques are proposed for interactive data selection in multiple linked views, including a 3D spatial volume view.

In this paper, we present a seamless multi-focus and context technique, called Balloon Focus, that allows the user to smoothly enlarge multiple treemap items served as the foci, while maintaining a stable treemap layout as the context. Our method has several desirable features. First, this method is quite general and can be used with different treemap layout algorithms. Second, as the foci are enlarged, the relative positions among all items are preserved. Third, the foci are placed in a way that the remaining space is evenly distributed back to the non-focus treemap items. When Balloon Focus enlarges the focus items to a maximum degree, the above features ensure that the treemap will maintain a consistent appearance and avoid any abrupt layout changes. In our algorithm, a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) is used to maintain the positional constraints, and an elastic model is employed to govern the placement of the treemap items.

It is, therefore, desirable that visualization methods take into account the entire multi-field volume data rather than concentrating on one variable. We present a visualization approach based on surface extraction from multi-field particle volume data. The surfaces segment the data with respect to the underlying multi-variate function. Decisions on segmentation properties are based on the analysis of the multi-dimensional feature space. The feature space exploration is performed by an automated multi-dimensional hierarchical clustering method, whose resulting density clusters are shown in the form of density level sets in a 3D star coordinate layout. In the star coordinate layout, the user can select clusters of interest. A selected cluster in feature space corresponds to a segmenting surface in object space. Based on the segmentation property induced by the cluster membership, we extract a surface from the volume data.

However, the engineering of these devices is a highly demanding task. Advanced modeling methods and computer simulations allow the investigation of the fluid flow inside such a device and in particular of potential blood damage. In this paper we present a set of visualization methods which have been designed to specifically support the analysis of a tensor-based blood damage prediction model. This model is based on the tracing of particles through the VAD, for each of which the cumulative blood damage can be computed. The model's tensor output approximates a single blood cell's deformation in the flow field. The tensor and derived scalar data are subsequently visualized using techniques based on icons, particle visualization, and function plotting. All these techniques are accessible through a Virtual Reality-based user interface, which features not only stereoscopic rendering but also natural interaction with the complex three-dimensional data.

State-of-the-art SPECT scanners yield a large number of regional parameters of the left-ventricular myocardium (e.g., blood supply at rest and during stress, wall thickness, and wall thickening during heart contraction) that all need to be assessed by the physician. Today, the individual parameters of this multivariate data set are displayed as stacks of 2D slices, bull's eye plots, or, more recently, surfaces in 3D, which depict the left-ventricular wall. In all these visualizations, the data sets are displayed side-by-side rather than in an integrated manner, such that the multivariate data have to be examined sequentially and need to be fused mentally. This is time consuming and error-prone. In this paper we present an interactive 3D glyph visualization, which enables an effective integrated visualization of the multivariate data. Results from semiotic theory are used to optimize the mapping of different variables to glyph properties. This facilitates an improved perception of important information and thus an accelerated diagnosis.

Existing approaches operate on gridded data and mainly on regular structured grids. When considering unstructured point-based volume data where sample points do not form regular patterns nor are they connected in any form, one would typically resample the data over a grid prior to applying the known PDE-based methods. We propose an approach that directly extracts smooth surfaces from unstructured point-based volume data without prior resampling or mesh generation. When operating on unstructured data one needs to quickly derive neighborhood information. The respective information is retrieved by partitioning the 3D domain into cells using a fed-tree and operating on its cells. We exploit neighborhood information to estimate gradients and mean curvature at every sample point using a four-dimensional least-squares fitting approach. Gradients and mean curvature are required for applying the chosen PDE-based method that combines hyperbolic advection to an isovalue of a given scalar field and mean curvature flow. Since we are using an explicit time-integration scheme, time steps and neighbor locations are bounded to ensure convergence of the process. To avoid small global time steps, one can use asynchronous local integration. We extract a smooth surface by successively fitting a smooth auxiliary function to the data set. This auxiliary function is initialized as a signed distance function. For each sample and for every time step we compute the respective gradient, the mean curvature, and a stable time step. With these informations the auxiliary function is manipulated using an explicit Euler time integration. The process successively continues with the next sample point in time. If the norm of the auxiliary function gradient in a sample exceeds a given threshold at some time, the auxiliary function is reinitialized to a signed distance function. After convergence of the evolvution, the resulting smooth surface is obtained by extracting the zero isosurface from the auxiliary function using direct isosurface extraction from unstructured point-based volume data and rendering the extracted surface using point-based rendering methods.",,Paul Rosenthal;Lars Linsen,Jacobs University;Jacobs University,,"Index Terms—,PDEs,,,surface extraction,level sets,point-based visualization,,,,,",,10,,

To preserve the expressiveness of the visual representation, a placed label should neither occlude other labels nor visual representatives (e.g., icons, lines) that communicate crucial information. Optimal, non-overlapping labeling is an NP-hard problem. Thus, only a few approaches achieve a fast non-overlapping labeling in highly interactive scenarios like information visualization. These approaches generally target the point-feature label placement (PFLP) problem, solving only label-label conflicts. This paper presents a new, fast, solid and flexible 2D labeling approach for the PFLP problem that additionally respects other visual elements and the visual extent of labeled features. The results (number of placed labels, processing time) of our particle-based method compare favorably to those of existing techniques. Although the esthetic quality of non-real-time approaches may not be achieved with our method, it complies with practical demands and thus supports the interactive exploration of information spaces. In contrast to the known adjacent techniques, the flexibility of our technique enables labeling of dense point clouds by the use of non-occluding distant labels.

Small multiple views of different experimental conditions and a data-driven parallel coordinates view enable correlations between experimental conditions to be analyzed at the same time that the data is viewed in the graph context. This combination of coordinated views allows the biologist to view the data from many different perspectives simultaneously.

One of the most interesting models which came up with Einstein's theory was developed by Kurt Godel in 1949. The Godel universe is a valid solution of Einstein's field equations, making it a possible physical description of our universe. It offers remarkable features like the existence of an optical horizon beyond which time travel is possible. Although we know that our universe is not a Godel universe, it is interesting to visualize physical aspects of a world model resulting from a theory which is highly confirmed in scientific history. Standard techniques to adopt an egocentric point of view in a relativistic world model have shortcomings with respect to the time needed to render an image as well as difficulties in applying a direct illumination model. In this paper we want to face both issues to reduce the gap between common visualization standards and relativistic visualization. We will introduce two techniques to speed up recalculation of images by means of preprocessing and lookup tables and to increase image quality through a special optimization applicable to the Godel universe. The first technique allows the physicist to understand the different effects of general relativity faster and better by generating images from existing datasets interactively. By using the intrinsic symmetries of Godel's spacetime which are expressed by the Killing vector field, we are able to reduce the necessary calculations to simple cases using the second technique. This even makes it feasible to account for a direct illumination model during the rendering process. Although the presented methods are applied to Godel's universe, they can also be extended to other manifolds, for example light propagation in moving dielectric media.

More generally, this main result suggests that other tensor invariants, such as anisotropy measures like fractional anisotropy (FA), can be used in the same framework in lieu of mode to identify important structural properties in tensor fields. Our implementation addresses the specific challenge posed by the non-linearity of the considered scalar measures and by the smoothness requirement of the crease manifold computation. We use a combination of smooth reconstruction kernels and adaptive refinement strategy that automatically adjust the resolution of the analysis to the spatial variation of the considered quantities.

This allowed us to measure organizational behavior directly, allowing us to evaluate the perceptual importance of particular visual features, such as edge crossings and edge-lengths uniformity. We also manipulated the interior structure of the node relationships by designing data sets that contained clusters, that is, sets of nodes that are strongly interconnected. By varying the degree to which these clusters were ldquomaskedrdquo by extraneous edges we were able to measure observerspsila sensitivity to the existence of clusters and how they revealed them in the network diagram. Based on these measurements we found that observers are able to recover cluster structure, that the distance between clusters is inversely related to the strength of the clustering, and that users exhibit the tendency to use edges to visually delineate perceptual groups.

Those parameters can determine the effectiveness and accuracy of the visualization. Frequently, volumetric data includes multiple structures and features that need to be differentiated. However, if those features have the same intensity and gradient values, existing transfer functions are limited at effectively illustrating those similar features with different rendering properties. We introduce texture-based transfer functions for direct volume rendering. In our approach, the voxelpsilas resulting opacity and color are based on local textural properties rather than individual intensity values. For example, if the intensity values of the vessels are similar to those on the boundary of the lungs, our texture-based transfer function will analyze the textural properties in those regions and color them differently even though they have the same intensity values in the volume. The use of texture-based transfer functions has several benefits. First, structures and features with the same intensity and gradient values can be automatically visualized with different rendering properties. Second, segmentation or prior knowledge of the specific features within the volume is not required for classifying these features differently. Third, textural metrics can be combined and/or maximized to capture and better differentiate similar structures.

An effective labeling must balance the conflicting goals of conveying the shape of the surface while being legible from a range of viewing directions. Shape can be conveyed by placing the text as a texture directly on the surface, providing shape cues, meaningful landmarks and minimally obstructing the rest of the model. But rendering such surface text is problematic both in regions of high curvature, where text would be warped, and in highly occluded regions, where it would be hidden. Our approach achieves both labeling goals by applying surface labels to a psilatext scaffoldpsila, a surface explicitly constructed to hold the labels. Text scaffolds conform to the underlying surface whenever possible, but can also float above problem regions, allowing them to be smooth while still conveying the overall shape. This paper provides methods for constructing scaffolds from a variety of input sources, including meshes, constructive solid geometry, and scalar fields. These sources are first mapped into a distance transform, which is then filtered and used to construct a new mesh on which labels are either manually or automatically placed. In the latter case, annotated regions of the input surface are associated with proximal regions on the new mesh, and labels placed using cartographic principles.",,Gregory Cipriano;Michael Gleicher,University of Wisconsin-Madison;University of Wisconsin-Madison,,"Index Terms—,surface labeling,,,computational cartography,text authoring,annotation,,,,,",,13,,

While attempts have been made to quantify this mismatch, and algorithms proposed to minimize inconsistency, solutions provided tend to concentrate on one-dimensional ordering. We propose extensions to the existing squarified layout algorithm that exploit the two-dimensional arrangement of treemap nodes more effectively. Our proposed spatial squarified layout algorithm provides a more consistent arrangement of nodes while maintaining low aspect ratios. It is suitable for the arrangement of data with a geographic component and can be used to create tessellated cartograms for geovisualization. Locational consistency is measured and visualized and a number of layout algorithms are compared. CIELab color space and displacement vector overlays are used to assess and emphasize the spatial layout of treemap nodes. A case study involving locations of tagged photographs in the Flickr database is described.",,Jo Wood;Jason Dykes,"giCentre, City University London;giCentre, City University London",,"Index Terms—,Geovisualization,,,Treemaps,Cartograms,CIELab,Geographic information,Tree structures,,,",,84,,

In this paper, we introduce size-based transfer functions, which map the local scale of features to color and opacity. Features in a data set with similar or identical scalar values can be classified based on their relative size. We achieve this with the use of scale fields, which are 3D fields that represent the relative size of the local feature at each voxel. We present a mechanism for obtaining these scale fields at interactive rates, through a continuous scale-space analysis and a set of detection filters. Through a number of examples, we show that size-based transfer functions can improve classification and enhance volume rendering techniques, such as maximum intensity projection. The ability to classify objects based on local size at interactive rates proves to be a powerful method for complex data exploration.",,Carlos Correa;Kwan-Liu Ma,University of California at Davis;University of California at Davis,,"Index Terms—,Transfer Functions,,,Interactive Visualization,Volume Rendering,Scale Space,GPU Techniques,,,,",,110,,

However, this has two defects: not all of the properties described converge to the same solution, and the statistics computed are not always invariant under isosurface-preserving transformations. We apply Federer's Coarea Formula from geometric measure theory to explain these discrepancies. We describe an improved substitute for histograms based on weighting with the inverse gradient magnitude, develop a statistical model that is invariant under isosurface-preserving transformations, and argue that this provides a consistent method for algorithm evaluation across multiple datasets based on histogram equalization. We use our corrected formulation to reevaluate recent results on average isosurface complexity, and show evidence that noise is one cause of the discrepancy between the expected figure and the observed one.",,Carlos E.

By presenting these predictions in a carefully designed interface, users can create visualizations and other data products more efficiently because they can augment their normal work patterns with the suggested completions.

Most approaches are based on a volumetric, particle based, or image based representation of the smoke. This paper introduces an alternative representation of smoke structures: as semi-transparent streak surfaces. In order to make streak surface integration fast enough for interactive applications, we avoid expensive adaptive retriangulations by coupling the opacity of the triangles to their shapes. This way, the surface shows a smoke-like look even in rather turbulent areas. Furthermore, we show modifications of the approach to mimic smoke nozzles, wool tufts, and time surfaces.

Records are assigned locations within the circle as a function of its relative attraction to each of the DAs. The DAs can be moved either interactively or algorithmically to reveal different meaningful patterns in the dataset. In this paper we describe Vectorized Radviz (VRV) which extends the number of dimensions through data flattening. We show how VRV increases the power of Radviz through these extra dimensions by enhancing the flexibility in the layout of the DAs. We apply VRV to the problem of analyzing the results of multiple clusterings of the same data set, called multiple cluster sets or cluster ensembles. We show how features of VRV help discern patterns across the multiple cluster sets. We use the Iris data set to explain VRV and a newt gene microarray data set used in studying limb regeneration to show its utility. We then discuss further applications of VRV.",,John Sharko;Georges Grinstein;Kenneth A. Marx,"Dept. of Comput. Sci., Univ. of Massachusetts - Lowell, Lowell, MA;Dept. of Comput.

Even if the shapes of the small structures are evident in a 3D display, the aggregate shapes they suggest may not be easily inferred. From previous studies in shape perception, the evidence has not been clear whether physically-based illumination confers any advantage over local illumination for understanding scenes that arise in visualization of large data sets that contain features at two distinct scales. In this paper we show that physically-based illumination can improve the perception for some static scenes of complex 3D geometry from flow fields. We perform human-subjects experiments to quantify the effect of physically-based illumination on participant performance for two tasks: selecting the closer of two streamtubes from a field of tubes, and identifying the shape of the domain of a flow field over different densities of tubes. We find that physically-based illumination influences participant performance as strongly as perspective projection, suggesting that physically-based illumination is indeed a strong cue to the layout of complex scenes. We also find that increasing the density of tubes for the shape identification task improved participant performance under physically-based illumination but not under the traditional hardware-accelerated illumination model.",,Chris Weigle;David Banks,"UT/ORNL Joint Institiute for Computational Sciences, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee;UT/ORNL Joint Institiute for Computational Sciences, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee",,"Index Terms—,user study,DT-MRI,white matter tractography,volume completion,3D shape perception,physically-based illumination,global illumination,local illumination,multi-scale visualization,flow visualization,streamtubes",,12,,

We aim at generalizing the concept of scatterplots to the visualization of spatially continuous input data by a continuous and dense plot. An example of a continuous input field is data defined on an n-D spatial grid with respective interpolation or reconstruction of in-between values. We propose a rigorous, accurate, and generic mathematical model of continuous scatterplots that considers an arbitrary density defined on an input field on an n-D domain and that maps this density to m-D scatterplots. Special cases are derived from this generic model and discussed in detail: scatterplots where the n-D spatial domain and the m-D data attribute domain have identical dimension, 1-D scatterplots as a way to define continuous histograms, and 2-D scatterplots of data on 3-D spatial grids. We show how continuous histograms are related to traditional discrete histograms and to the histograms of isosurface statistics. Based on the mathematical model of continuous scatterplots, respective visualization algorithms are derived, in particular for 2-D scatterplots of data from 3-D tetrahedral grids. For several visualization tasks, we show the applicability of continuous scatterplots. Since continuous scatterplots do not only sample data at grid points but interpolate data values within cells, a dense and complete visualization of the data set is achieved that scales well with increasing data set size. Especially for irregular grids with varying cell size, improved results are obtained when compared to conventional scatterplots. Therefore, continuous scatterplots are a suitable extension of a statistics visualization technique to be applied to typical data from scientific computation.",,Sven Bachthaler;Daniel Weiskopf,"VISUS (Visualization Research Center), Universität Stuttgart;VISUS (Visualization Research Center), Universität Stuttgart",,"Index Terms—,Scatterplot,,,histogram,continuous frequency plot,interpolation,,,,,",,86,,

Methods either try to visualize all variables simultaneously at each position using glyph-based approaches or use linked views for the interaction between attribute space and physical domain such as brushing of scatterplots. Most visualizations of the attribute space are either difficult to understand or suffer from visual clutter. We propose a transformation of the high-dimensional data in attribute space to 2D that results in a point cloud, called attribute cloud, such that points with similar multivariate attributes are located close to each other. The transformation is based on ideas from multivariate density estimation and manifold learning. The resulting attribute cloud is an easy to understand visualization of multivariate data in two dimensions. We explain several techniques to incorporate additional information into the attribute cloud, that help the user get a better understanding of multivariate data. Using different examples from fluid dynamics and climate simulation, we show how brushing can be used to explore the attribute cloud and find interesting structures in physical space.",,Heike Jänicke;Michael Böttinger;Gerik Scheuermann,University of Leipzig;German Climate Computing Centre (DKRZ);University of Leipzig,,"Index Terms—,Multivariate data,,,brushing,data transformation,manifold learning,linked views.,,,,",,50,,
