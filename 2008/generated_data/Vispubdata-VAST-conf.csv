VAST-conf,2008,Interactive poster: Visual analytic techniques for CO2 emissions and concentrations in the United States,10.1109/VAST.2008.4677372,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2008.4677372,173,174,Conferences,"Climate change has emerged as one of the grand global challenges facing humanity. The dominant anthropogenic greenhouse gas that seems to be contributing to the climate change problem, carbon dioxide (CO2), has a complex cycle through the atmosphere, oceans and biosphere. The combustion of fossil fuels (power production, transportation, etc.) remains the largest source of anthropogenic CO2 to the Earthpsilas atmosphere. Up until very recently, the quantification of fossil fuel CO2 was understood only at coarse space and time scales. A recent research effort has greatly improved this space/time quantification resulting in source data at a resolution of less than 10 km2/hr at the surface of North America. By providing visual tools to examine this new, high resolution CO2 data, we can better understand the way that CO2 is transmitted within the atmosphere and how it is exchanged with other components of the Earth System. We have developed interactive visual analytic tools, which allows for easy data manipulation, analysis, and extraction. The visualization system is aimed for a wide range of users which include researchers and political leaders. The goal is to help assist these people in analyzing data and enabling new policy options in mitigation of fossil fuel CO2 emissions in the U.S.",,Nathan Andrysco;Bedrich Benes;Kevin Gurney,"Department of Computer Science, Purdue University, USA;Department of Computer Graphics Technology, Purdue University, USA;Department of Atmospheric Sciences, Purdue University, USA",,"Visual Analytics,CO2,,,,,,,Multivariate and Spatio-Temporal Data,Volume Visualization,GIS,Interactive Visualization,I.3.8 [Computer Graphics]: Applications—,,,",,0,,

I am working in a research project related to this challenge where I am responsible for the interactive visualization part. My goal are interactive visualizations to explore such time-oriented data according to the user tasks while considering the structure of time. Time is composed of many granularities that are likely to have crucial influence on the formation of the data. The challenge is to integrate the granularities into a detailed compound view on the data, like the compound eye of insects integrates many images into one view. Other members of our team are experts in temporal data mining and user centered design. The goal is to combine our research topics to an integrated system that helps domain experts to get more insight from their time-oriented data.",,Tim Lammarsch,"Department of Information and Knowledge Engineering (ike), Danube University Krems, Austria",,"I.3.6 [Computing Methodologies]: Computer Graphics—Methodology and Techniques,H.5.m [Information Systems]: Information Interfaces And Presentation (e.g., HCI)—Miscellaneous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,",,0,,

However, choosing among mutual funds is not an easy task because they vary in many different dimensions, such as asset size, turnover and fee structure, and these characteristics may affect fund returns. It is thus important to understand the relation between fund performance and these properties. In this work, we use a new visual analytical tool, the density-based distribution map, to assist in this task.

However, if the exploration is long or done in multiple sessions, it can be hard for analysts to remember all interesting visualizations and the relationships among them they have seen. Often, they will see the same or similar visualizations, and are unable to recall when, why and how they have seen something similar. Recalling and retrieving interesting visualizations are important tasks for the analysis processes such as problem solving, reasoning, and conceptualization. In this paper, we argue that offering support for thinking based on past analysis processes is important, and present a solution for this.",,Yedendra B.

The results of such numerical simulations are often difficult to interpret for decision makers. We describe a terrain rendering engine that uses photorealistic metaphors to represent typical terrain properties without representing an actual terrain. In the context of ground motion, a simulation of the effects of various types of earthquakes on buildings has been conducted. Usually, such structural response simulations are carried out independently and are being visualized separate from the ground motion simulation. We combine the results from both simulations in an interactive, hybrid visualization so that decision makers (first responders and emergency management agencies) are provided with a photo-realistic, simulated view of various earthquake scenarios, enabling them to study the effect of various earthquakes on buildings typical for a rural or urban area. We present a method for visually analyzing large-scale simulation data from different sources (ground motion simulation and structural response simulation) using photorealistic metaphors. We have implemented an intuitive, interactive system for visual analysis and inspection of possible effects of various types of earthquakes on an inventory of buildings typical for a particular area.

To ease the extraction of unique and potentially interesting structures we applied usual high-dimensional classification concepts to the unusual field of crystallography. We experimented with various crystal structure descriptors, distinct distance measures and tried different clustering methods to identify groups of similar structures. These methods are already applied in combinatorial chemistry to organic molecules for a different goal and in somewhat different forms, but are not widely used for crystal structures classification. We adopted a visual design and validation method in the development of a library (CrystalFp) and an end-user application to select and validate method choices, to gain userspsila acceptance and to tap into their domain expertise.

While work in this area has relied on either manually recorded provenance (e.g., user notes) or automatically recorded event-based insight provenance (e.g., clicks, drags, and key-presses), both approaches have fundamental limitations. Our aim is to develop a new approach that combines the benefits of both approaches while avoiding their deficiencies. Toward this goal, we characterize userspsila visual analytic activity at multiple levels of granularity. Moreover, we identify a critical level of abstraction, Actions, that can be used to represent visual analytic activity with a set of general but semantically meaningful behavior types. In turn, the action types can be used as the semantic building blocks for insight provenance. We present a catalog of common actions identified through observations of several different visual analytic systems.

How to automatically and effectively discover new knowledge from rich multimedia data poses a compelling challenge since state-of-the-art data mining techniques can most often only search and extract pre-defined patterns or knowledge from complex heterogeneous data. In light of this, our approach is to take advantages of both the power of human perception system and the power of computational algorithms. More specifically, we propose an approach that allows scientists to use data mining as a first pass, and then forms a closed loop of visual analysis of current results followed by more data mining work inspired by visualization, the results of which can be in turn visualized and lead to the next round of visual exploration and analysis. In this way, new insights and hypotheses gleaned from the raw data and the current level of analysis can contribute to further analysis. As a first step toward this goal, we implement a visualization system with three critical components: (1) A smooth interface between visualization and data mining. The new analysis results can be automatically loaded into our visualization tool. (2) A flexible tool to explore and query temporal data derived from raw multimedia data. We represent temporal data into two forms - continuous variables and event variables. We have developed various ways to visualize both temporal correlations and statistics of multiple variables with the same type, and conditional and high-order statistics between continuous and event variables. (3) A seamless interface between raw multimedia data and derived data.

However, the unsupervised nature of the algorithm may be disadvantageous in certain applications. Depending on initialization and data characteristics, cluster maps (cluster layouts) may emerge that do not comply with user preferences, expectations, or the application context. Considering SOM-based analysis of trajectory data, we propose a comprehensive visual-interactive monitoring and control framework extending the basic SOM algorithm. The framework implements the general Visual Analytics idea to effectively combine automatic data analysis with human expert supervision. It provides simple, yet effective facilities for visually monitoring and interactively controlling the trajectory clustering process at arbitrary levels of detail. The approach allows the user to leverage existing domain knowledge and user preferences, arriving at improved cluster maps.

A unique aspect of our approach is that the LP rules are automatically learned, using Inductive Logic Programming, from examples of data that the analyst deems interesting when viewing the data in the high-dimensional visualization interface. Using this system, analysts will be able to construct models of arbitrary relationships in the data, explore the data for scenarios that fit the model, refine the model if necessary, and query the model to automatically analyze incoming (future) data exhibiting the encoded relationships. In other words it will support both model-driven data exploration, as well as data-driven model evolution.

Unfortunately, many outbreaks are difficult to detect because their signal is obscured by the statistical noise. Consequently, many detection algorithms have a high false positive rate. While many false alerts can be easily filtered by trained epidemiologists, others require health officials to drill down into the data, analyzing specific segments of the population and historical trends over time and space. Furthermore, the ability to accurately recognize meaningful patterns in the data becomes more challenging as these data sources increase in volume and complexity. To facilitate more accurate and efficient event detection, we have created a visual analytics tool that provides analysts with linked geo-spatiotemporal and statistical analytic views. We model syndromic hotspots by applying a kernel density estimation on the population sample. When an analyst selects a syndromic hotspot, temporal statistical graphs of the hotspot are created. Similarly, regions in the statistical plots may be selected to generate geospatial features specific to the current time period. Demographic filtering can then be combined to determine if certain populations are more affected than others.

Coordinated multiple view approaches have become commonplace in visual analysis tools because they directly support expression of complex multidimensional queries using simple interactions. However, generating such tools remains difficult because of the need to map domain-specific data structures and semantics into the idiosyncratic combinations of interdependent data and visual abstractions needed to reveal particular patterns and distributions in cross-dimensional relationships. This paper describes: (1) a method for interactively expressing sequences of multidimensional set queries by cross-filtering data values across pairs of views, and (2) design strategies for constructing coordinated multiple view interfaces for cross-filtered visual analysis of multidimensional data sets. Using examples of cross-filtered visualizations of data from several different domains, we describe how cross-filtering can be modularized and reused across designs, flexibly customized with respect to data types across multiple dimensions, and incorporated into more wide-ranging multiple view designs. The demonstrated analytic utility of these examples suggest that cross-filtering is a suitable design pattern for instantiation in a wide variety of visual analysis tools.",,Chris Weaver,"The GeoVISTA Center and Department of Geography, The Pennsylvania State University, USA",,"D.2.2 [Software Engineering]: Design Tools and Techniques—[User Interfaces],H.2.3 [Information Systems]: Database Management—[Languages],,,,,,,H.5.2 [Information Systems]: Information Interfaces and Presentation—[User Interfaces],,,,,,,",,15,,
