InfoVis-conf,1999,3D interactive visualization for inter-cell dependencies of spreadsheets,10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801861,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801861,79,82,Conferences,"This paper proposes a new technique to visualize dependencies among cells in a spreadsheet. In this way, the system firstly visualizes a spreadsheet on a plane in three-dimensional space, and draws arcs between interrelated cells. By allowing a user to select an arbitrary cell and lift it up with direct manipulation, the system utilizes the third dimension to ameliorate visual occlusion of crossing arcs. As the user lifts a focused cell up, the interrelated cells are lifted up together; thus hidden dataflow networks can be visually intelligible interactively. Because spreadsheets are aimed at calculation itself rather than appearances of outputs, their mechanism is relatively invisible and not obvious for ordinary users. Our visualization helps such users to understand structures and mechanism of spreadsheets.",,H. Shiozawa;K. Okada;Y. Matsushita,"Dept. of Inf. & Comput. Sci., Keio Univ., Yokohama, Japan;;",,,,9,,
InfoVis-conf,1999,The automated multidimensional detective,10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801865,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801865,112,119,Conferences,"Automation has arrived to parallel coordinates. A geometrically motivated classifier is presented and applied, with both training and testing stages, to 3 real datasets. Our results compared to those from 33 other classifiers have the least error. The algorithm is based on parallel coordinates and has very low computational complexity in the number of variables and the size of the dataset-contrasted with the very high or unknown (often unstated) complexity of other classifiers, the low complexity enables the rule derivation to be done in near real-time hence making the classification adaptive to changing conditions, provides comprehensible and explicit rules-contrasted to neural networks which are ""black boxes"", does dimensionality selection-where the minimal set of original variables (not transformed new variables as in Principal Component Analysis) required to state the rule is found, orders these variables so as to optimize the clarity of separation between the designated set and its complement-this solves the pesky ""ordering problem"" in parallel coordinates. The algorithm is display independent, hence it can be applied to very large in size and number of variables datasets. Though it is instructive to present the results visually, the input size is no longer display-limited as for visual data mining.",,A. Inselberg;T. Avidan,"Dept. of Comput.

InfoVis-conf,1999,A Java-based visual mining infrastructure and applications,10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801867,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801867,124,127,Conferences,"Many real-world KDD (Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining) applications involve the navigation of large volumes of information on the web, such as, Internet resources, hot topics, and telecom phone switches. Quite often users feel lost, confused and overwhelmed with displays that contain too much information. This paper discusses a new content-driven visual mining infrastructure called VisMine, that uses several innovative techniques: (1) hidden visual structure and relationships for uncluttering displays; (2) simultaneous visual presentations for high-dimensional knowledge discovery; and (3) a new visual interface to plug in existing graphic toolkits for expanding its use in a wide variety of visual applications. We have applied this infrastructure to three data mining visualization applications-topic hierarchy for document navigation, web-based trouble shooting, and telecom switch mining.",,M.C. Hao;U.

InfoVis-conf,1999,Visualizing application behavior on superscalar processors,10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801852,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801852,10,17,Conferences,"The advent of superscalar processors with out-of-order execution makes it increasingly difficult to determine how well an application is utilizing the processor and how to adapt the application to improve its performance. We describe a visualization system for the analysis of application behavior on superscalar processors. Our system provides an overview-plus-detail display of the application's execution. A timeline view of pipeline performance data shows the overall utilization of the pipeline. This information is displayed using multiple time scales, enabling the user to drill down from a high-level application overview to a focus region of hundreds of cycles. This region of interest is displayed in detail using an animated cycle-by-cycle view of the execution. This view shows how instructions are reordered and executed and how functional units are being utilized. Additional context views correlate instuctions in this detailed view with the relevant source code for the application. This allows the user to discover the root cause of the poor pipeline utilization and make changes to the application to improve its performance. This visualization system can be easily configured to display a variety of processor models and configurations. We demonstrate it for both the MXS and MMIX processor models.",,C. Stolte;R. Bosch;P.

InfoVis-conf,1999,Cushion treemaps: visualization of hierarchical information,10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801860,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801860,73,78,Conferences,"A new method is presented for the visualization of hierarchical information, such as directory structures and organization structures. Cushion treemaps inherit the elegance of standard treemaps: compact, space-filling displays of hierarchical information, based on recursive subdivision of a rectangular image space. Intuitive shading is used to provide insight in the hierarchical structure. During the subdivision, ridges are added per rectangle, which are rendered with a simple shading model. The result is a surface that consists of recursive cushions. The method is efficient, effective, easy to use and implement, and has a wide applicability.",,J.J. Van Wijk;H.

InfoVis-conf,1999,Navigating hierarchies with structure-based brushes,10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801858,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801858,58,64,Conferences,"Interactive selection is a critical component in exploratory visualization, allowing users to isolate subsets of the displayed information for highlighting, deleting, analysis, or focussed investigation. Brushing, a popular method for implementing the selection process, has traditionally been performed in either screen space or data space. We introduce the concept of a structure-based brush, which can be used to perform selection in hierarchically structured data sets. Our structure-based brush allows users to navigate hierarchies by specifying focal extents and level-of-detail on a visual representation of the structure. Proximity-based coloring, which maps similar colors to data that are closely related within the structure, helps convey both structural relationships and anomalies. We describe the design and implementation of our structure-based brushing tool. We also validate its usefulness using two distinct hierarchical visualization techniques, namely hierarchical parallel coordinates and tree-maps.",,Ying-Huey Fua;M.O. Ward;E.A.

InfoVis-conf,1999,Efficient multi-object dynamic query histograms,10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801862,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801862,84,91,Conferences,"Dynamic queries offer continuous feedback during range queries, and have been shown to be effective and satisfying. Recent work has extended them to datasets of 100,000 objects and, separately, to queries involving relations among multiple objects. The latter work enables filtering houses by properties of their owners, for instance. Our primary concern is providing feedback from histograms during dynamic query. The height of each histogram bar shows the count of selected objects whose attribute value falls into a given range. Unfortunately, previous efficient algorithms for single object queries overcount in the case of multiple objects if for instance, a house has multiple owners. This paper presents an efficient algorithm that with high probability closely approximates the true counts.",,M. Derthick;J. Harrison;A. Moore;S.F.

The visual metaphor is presented as an alternative to current techniques of dimensional compression and the visualization tools that employ them. The paper discusses the motivation for the Sunflower paradigm, its implementation and critical factors for producing an effective visualization. A primary driver in this research effort has been to develop a visualization tool that facilitates browsing, knowledge discovery, and that supports learning through sense making and integration of new information.",,S.J.

InfoVis-conf,1999,Cluster and calendar based visualization of time series data,10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801851,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801851,4,9,Conferences,"A new method is presented to get an insight into univariate time series data. The problem addressed is how to identify patterns and trends on multiple time scales (days, weeks, seasons) simultaneously. The solution presented is to cluster similar daily data patterns, and to visualize the average patterns as graphs and the corresponding days on a calendar. This presentation provides a quick insight into both standard and exceptional patterns. Furthermore, it is well suited to interactive exploration. Two applications, numbers of employees present and energy consumption, are presented.",,J.J. Van Wijk;E.R. Van Selow,"Dept. of Math. & Comput.

InfoVis-conf,1999,Sensemaking of evolving Web sites using visualization spreadsheets,10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801853,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801853,18,25,Conferences,"In the process of knowledge discovery, workers examine available information in order to make sense of it. By sensemaking, we mean interacting with and operating on the information with a variety of information processing mechanisms. Previously, we introduced a concept that uses the spreadsheet metaphor with cells containing visualizations of complex data. We extend and apply a cognitive model called ""visual sensemaking"" to the visualization spreadsheet. We use the task of making sense of a large Web site as a concrete example throughout the paper for demonstration. Using a variety of visualization techniques, such as the Disk Tree and Cone Tree, we show that the interactions of the visualization spreadsheet help users draw conclusions from the overall relationships of the entire information set.",,E.H.

InfoVis-conf,1999,Evaluating a visualisation of image similarity as a tool for image browsing,10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801855,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801855,36,43,Conferences,"A similarity metric based on the low-level content of images can be used to create a visualisation in which visually similar images are displayed close to each other. We are carrying out a series of experiments to evaluate the usefulness of this type of visualisation as an image browsing aid. The initial experiment, described, considered whether people would find a given photograph more quickly in a visualisation than in a randomly arranged grid of images. The results show that the subjects were faster with the visualisation, although in post-experiment interviews many of them said that they preferred the clarity and regularity of the grid. We describe an algorithm with which the best aspects of the two layout types can be combined.",,K. Rodden;W. Basalaj;D. Sinclair;K. Wood,"Comput. Lab., Cambridge Univ., UK;;;",,,,32,,

We introduce the notion that there are different orders of information visualization with focus+context being a second-order visualization and provide a formal framework for describing and constructing focus+context visualizations.",,S.

InfoVis-conf,1999,Dynamic hierarchy specification and visualization,10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801859,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801859,65,72,Conferences,This paper describes concepts that underlie the design and implementation of an information exploration system that allows users to impose arbitrary hierarchical organizations on their data. Such hierarchies allow a user to embed important semantic information into the hierarchy definition. Our goal is to recognize the significance of this implicit information and to utilize it in the hierarchy visualization. The innovative features of our system include the dynamic modification of the hierarchy definitions and the definition and implementation of a set of layout algorithms that utilize semantic information implicit in the tree construction.,,R.M.

We use a combination of data aggregation algorithms and dynamically aggregating data markers (e.g., icons or symbols) to accommodate interactive zooming by a user while maintaining a representation that remains intuitive, consistent across multiple scales and uncluttered. This approach implicitly generates multiple levels of overview displays from a single set of underlying data.",,J.K. Rayson,"Mitre Corp., Bedford, MA, USA",,,,7,,
InfoVis-conf,1999,Constellation: a visualization tool for linguistic queries from MindNet,10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801869,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801869,132,135,Conferences,"Constellation is a visualization system for the results of queries from the MindNet natural language semantic network. Constellation is targeted at helping MindNet's creators and users refine their algorithms, as opposed to understanding the structure of language. We designed a special-purpose graph layout algorithm which exploits higher-level structure in addition to the basic node and edge connectivity. Our layout prioritizes the creation of a semantic space to encode plausibility instead of traditional graph drawing metrics like minimizing edge crossings. We make careful use of several perceptual channels both to minimize the visual impact of edge crossings and to emphasize highlighted constellations of nodes and edges.",,T. Munzner;F. Guimbretiere;G.

We found that animation improves users' ability to reconstruct the information space, with no penalty on task performance time. We believe that this study provides strong evidence for adding animated transitions in many applications with fixed spatial data where the user navigates around the data space.",,B.B. Bederson;A.

DADV was used to design the data visualization in VisEIO-LCA, which is a framework to visualize environmental data about products. Most of the visualizations are designed using the following stages: formatting data in tables, selecting visual structures, and rendering the data on the screen. Although many visualization authors perform implicit domain analysis, in this paper domain analysis is added explicitly to the process of designing visualizations with the goal of producing move usable software tools. Environmental Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) is used as a test bed for this technique.",,O.J. Espinosa;C. Hendrickson;J.H. Garrett,"Dept. of Civil & Environ.

InfoVis-conf,1999,Visualizing association rules for text mining,10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801866,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801866,120,123,Conferences,"An association rule in data mining is an implication of the form X/spl rarr/Y where X is a set of antecedent items and Y is the consequent item. For years researchers have developed many tools to visualize association rules. However, few of these tools can handle more than dozens of rules, and none of them can effectively manage rules with multiple antecedents. Thus, it is extremely difficult to visualize and understand the association information of a large data set even when all the rules are available. This paper presents a novel visualization technique to tackle many of these problems. We apply the technology to a text mining study on large corpora. The results indicate that our design can easily handle hundreds of multiple antecedent association rules in a three-dimensional display with minimum human interaction, low occlusion percentage, and no screen swapping.",,Pak Chung Wong;P.
