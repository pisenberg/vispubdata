We demonstrate that excellent simplified models can be produced without the need to compare against information from the original geometry while performing local changes to the model. We use edge collapses to perform simplification, as do a number of other methods. We select the position of the new vertex so that the original volume of the model is maintained and we minimize the per-triangle change in volume of the tetrahedra swept out by those triangles that are moved. We also maintain surface area near boundaries and minimize the per-triangle area changes. Calculating the edge collapse priorities and the positions of the new vertices requires only the face connectivity and the the vertex locations in the intermediate model. This approach is memory efficient, allowing the simplification of very large polygonal models, and it is also fast. Moreover, simplified models created using this technique compare favorably to a number of other published simplification methods in terms of mean geometric error.","article_number":"745314","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=745314","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/745314/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '98 (Cat.

Several schemes have been developed to address this problem of view-dependent level-of-detail control. Among these, the view-dependent progressive mesh (VDPM) framework represents an arbitrary triangle mesh as a hierarchy of geometrically optimized refinement transformations, from which accurate approximating meshes can be efficiently retrieved. In this paper we extend the general VDPM framework to provide temporal coherence through the run-time creation of geomorphs. These geomorphs eliminate \"popping\" artifacts by smoothly interpolating geometry. Their implementation requires new output-sensitive data structures, which have the added benefit of reducing memory use. We specialize the VDPM framework to the important case of terrain rendering. To handle huge terrain grids, we introduce a block-based simplification scheme that constructs a progressive mesh as a hierarchy of block refinements. We demonstrate the need for an accurate approximation metric during simplification. Our contributions are highlighted in a real-time flyover of a large, rugged terrain. Notably, the use of geomorphs results in visually smooth rendering even at 72 frames/sec on a graphics workstation.","article_number":"745282","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=745282","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/745282/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '98 (Cat.

Configuration space is a geometric representation of rigid-body interaction that encodes quantitative information, such as part motion paths, and qualitative information, such as system failure modes. The configuration space dimension equals the number of degrees of freedom in the system. Three-dimensional spaces are most important, but higher-dimensions are often useful. The qualitative aspects, which relate to the topology of the configuration space, are best understood by visualization.

We take scene geometry, in contrast, to be embodied in mappings of viewing rays from their original 3D intercepts into the warped multiperspective image space. This approach allows us to render approximations of scenes with occlusions using time dense and spatially sparse sequences of camera rays, which is a significant improvement over the storage requirements of an equivalent animation sequence. Additional data compression can be achieved using sparse time keyframes as well. Interpolating the paths of sparse time key rays correctly in image space requires singular interpolation functions with spatial discontinuities. While there are many technical questions yet to be resolved, the employment of these singular interpolation functions in the multiperspective image space appears to be of potential interest for generating general viewpoint scene renderings with minimal data storage.","article_number":"745320","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=745320","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/745320/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '98 (Cat.

The input can be an inaccurate scalar or vector field, sampled densely or sparsely on a regular 3D grid, in which poor resolution and the presence of spurious noisy samples make traditional iso-surface techniques inappropriate. In this paper, we present a general-purpose methodology to extract surfaces or curves from a digital 3D potential vector field {(s,v~)}, in which each voxel holds a scalar s designating the strength and a vector v~ indicating the direction. For scalar, sparse or low-resolution data, we \"vectorize\" and \"densify\" the volume by tensor voting to produce dense vector fields that are suitable as input to our algorithms, the extremal surface and curve algorithms. Both algorithms extract, with sub-voxel precision, coherent features representing local extrema in the given vector field. These coherent features are a hole-free triangulation mesh (in the surface case), and a set of connected, oriented and non-intersecting polyline segments (in the curve case). We demonstrate the general usefulness of both extremal algorithms on a variety of real data by properly extracting their inherent extremal properties, such as (a) shock waves induced by abrupt velocity or direction changes in a flow field, (b) interacting vortex cores and vorticity lines in a velocity field, (c) crest-lines and ridges implicit in a digital terrain map, and (d) grooves, anatomical lines and complex surfaces from noisy dental data.","article_number":"745290","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=745290","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/745290/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '98 (Cat.

Texture patterns that form when the pexels are displayed can be used to rapidly and accurately explore the dataset. Our pexels are built by controlling three separate texture dimensions: height, density and regularity. Results from computer graphics, computer vision and cognitive psychology have identified these dimensions as important for the formation of perceptual texture patterns. We conducted a set of controlled experiments to measure the effectiveness of these dimensions, and to identify any visual interference that may occur when all three are displayed simultaneously at the same spatial location. Results from our experiments show that these dimensions can be used in specific combinations to form perceptual textures for visualizing multidimensional datasets.

Parallel transport framings, which work well for open curves, generally fail to have desirable properties for cyclic curves and for surfaces. We suggest that minimal quaternion measure provides an appropriate heuristic generalization of parallel transport. Our approach differs from minimal tangential acceleration approaches due to the addition of \"sliding ring\" constraints that fix one frame axis, but allow an axial rotational freedom whose value is varied in the optimization process. Our fundamental tool is the quaternion Gauss map, a generalization to quaternion space of the tangent map for curves and of the Gauss map for surfaces. The quaternion Gauss map takes 3D coordinate frame fields for curves and surfaces into corresponding curves and surfaces constrained to the space of possible orientations in quaternion space.

The diffusion rate can give clues to the structure of the underlying tissues. In some tissues, the rate is anisotropic. Diffusion-rate images can be calculated from diffusion-weighted MRI. A 2D diffusion tensor image (DTI) and an associated anatomical scalar field define seven values at each spatial location. We present two new methods for visually representing DTIs. The first method displays an array of ellipsoids, where the shape of each ellipsoid represents one tensor value. The ellipsoids are all normalized to approximately the same size so that they can be displayed simultaneously in context. The second method uses concepts from oil painting to represent the seven-valued data with multiple layers of varying brush strokes. Both methods successfully display most or all of the information in DTIs and provide exploratory methods for understanding them. The ellipsoid method has a simpler interpretation and explanation than the painting-motivated method; the painting-motivated method displays more of the information and is easier to read quantatively. We demonstrate the methods on images of the mouse spinal cord. The visualizations show significant differences between spinal cords from mice suffering from experimental allergic encephalomyelitis and spinal cords from wild-type mice. The differences are consistent with differences shown histologically and suggest that our new non-invasive imaging methodology and visualization of the results could have early diagnostic value for neurodegenerative diseases.","article_number":"745294","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=745294","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/745294/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '98 (Cat.

To this end, a field study was conducted to observe radiologists' interactions during MRI analysis in the traditional light screen environment. Key issues uncovered involve control over focus and context, dynamic grouping of images and retrieval of images and image groups. To address the problem of focus and context, existing layout adjustment and magnification techniques are explored to provide the most appropriate solution.

When applying these algorithms to large-scale time-varying fields, the storage overhead incurred from storing the search index often becomes overwhelming. This paper proposes an algorithm for locating isosurface cells in time-varying fields. We devise a new data structure, called the temporal hierarchical index tree, which utilizes the temporal coherence that exists in a time-varying field and adaptively coalesces the cells' extreme values over time; the resulting extreme values are then used to create the isosurface cell search index. For a typical time-varying scalar data set, not only does this temporal hierarchical index tree require much less storage space, but also the amount of I/O required to access the indices from the disk at different time steps is substantially reduced. We illustrate the utility and speed of our algorithm with data from several large-scale time-varying CFD simulations. Our algorithm can achieve more than 80% of disk-space savings when compared with the existing techniques, while the isosurface extraction time is nearly optimal.","article_number":"745298","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=745298","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/745298/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '98 (Cat.

Using a ray-casting approach we then compute the surface location between successive sample points along the viewing-ray by interpolation or bisection. The accurate calculation of the object boundary enables a much more precise computation of the gray-level-gradient yielding the surface normal.

The POP ocean model developed at Los Alamos is an example of such a global circulation model that is being used to investigate the role of the ocean in the climate system. Data output from POP has traditionally been visualized using video technology which precludes rapid modification of visualization parameters and techniques. This paper describes a visualization system that leverages high speed graphics hardware, specifically texture mapping hardware, to accelerate data exploration to interactive rates. We describe the design of the system, the specific hardware features used, and provide examples of its use. The system is capable of viewing ocean circulation simulation results at up to 60 frames per second while loading texture memory at approximately 72 million texels per second.","article_number":"745346","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=745346","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/745346/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '98 (Cat.

They are often met in the field of computer graphics and CAD systems based on geographic information systems. Although many approaches have been developed for these two problems, one difficulty still remains. That is how to ensure that the reconstructed surface is both smooth globally and coincides with the given contours exactly simultaneously. In this paper we solve the two problems in a unified framework. We use gradient controlled partial differential equation (PDE) surfaces to express terrain surfaces, in which the surface shapes can be globally determined by the contours, their locations, height and gradient values. The surface generated by this method is accurate in the sense of exactly coinciding with the original contours and smooth with C/sup 1/ continuity everywhere. The method can reveal smooth saddle shapes caused by surface branching of one to more and can make rational interpolated sub-contours between two or more neighboring contours.","article_number":"745281","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=745281","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/745281/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '98 (Cat.

This interactive process can be very complicated and time consuming. An alternative to the adjustment of transfer functions is the application of segmentation algorithms. These algorithms are often dedicated to a limited range of data sets and tend to be very compute intensive. We propose a morphology based hierarchical analysis to estimate the optical properties of the volume to be rendered. This approach requires fewer parameters and incorporates also spatial information, but it is far less compute intensive than most of the segmentation methods. The hierarchical analysis is constructed in analogy to the wavelet analysis, except for the fact, that nonlinear filters are used in our case. These morphological operators have a lower distortional influence on the analyzed structures than the usual linear filters. A special decomposition of the morphological operators is discussed, which leads to an efficient implementation of this approach. This technique reduces the three dimensional analysis to a one dimensional computation, as it is done in tensor product based linear filters.

A problem studied less often is how to preserve on a simplified mesh the detail (e.g., color, high frequency shape detail, scalar fields, etc.) which is encoded in the original mesh. We present a general approach for preserving detail on simplified meshes. The detail (or high frequency information) lost after simplification is encoded through texture or bump maps. The original contribution is that preservation is performed after simplification, by building set of triangular texture patches that are then packed in a single texture map. Each simplified mesh face is sampled to build the associated triangular texture patch; a new method for storing this set of texture patches into a standard rectangular texture is presented and discussed. Our detail preserving approach makes no assumptions about the simplification process adopted to reduce mesh complexity and allows highly efficient rendering. The solution is very general, allowing preservation of any attribute value defined on the high resolution mesh. We also describe an alternative application: the conversion of 3D models with 3D static procedural textures into standard 3D models with 2D textures.","article_number":"745285","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=745285","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/745285/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '98 (Cat.

The common trial-and-error approach for transfer function searching is a very difficult and time consuming process. A goal oriented and parameterized transfer function model is therefore crucial in guiding the transfer function searching process for better and more meaningful visualization results. The paper presents an image based transfer function model that integrates 3D image processing tools into the volume visualization pipeline to facilitate the search for an image based transfer function in volume data visualization and exploration. The model defines a transfer function as a sequence of 3D image processing procedures, and allows the users to adjust a set of qualitative and descriptive parameters to achieve their subjective visualization goals. 3D image enhancement and boundary detection tools, and their integration methods with volume visualization algorithms are described. The application of this approach for 3D microscopy data exploration and analysis is also discussed.","article_number":"745319","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=745319","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/745319/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '98 (Cat.

Screen door transparency is a technique to render transparent objects in a simple and efficient way: no sorting is required and intersecting polygons can be handled without further preprocessing. With this technique, polygons are rendered through a mask: only where the mask is present, pixels are set. However, artifacts such as incorrect opacities and distracting patterns can easily occur if the masks are not carefully designed. The requirements on the masks are considered. Next, three algorithms are presented for the generation of pixel masks. One algorithm is designed for the creation of small (e.g. 4/spl times/4) masks. The other two algorithms can be used for the creation of larger masks (e.g. 32/spl times/32).

In his multi-resolution form, the function requires strictly the same volume of data than the original input: It is then possible to go through consecutive levels by the use of so-called detail coefficients, with exact reconstruction if desired.

The usefulness of this measurement can be seen when comparing computational and experimental flow fields under the same conditions. Furthermore, its applicability can be extended to more cumbersome tasks, such as navigating through a large database, searching for similar topologies. This new measure relies on the use of critical points, which are a key feature in vector field topology. In order to characterize critical points, /spl alpha/ and /spl beta/ parameters are introduced. They are used to form a closed set of eight unique patterns for simple critical points. These patterns are also basic building blocks for higher-order nonlinear vector fields. In order to study and compare a given set of vector fields, a measure of distance between different patterns of critical points is introduced. The basic patterns of critical points are mapped onto a unit circle in /spl alpha/-/spl beta/ space. The concept of the \"Earth mover's distance\" is used to compute the closeness between various pairs of vector fields, and a nearest-neighbor query is thus produced to illustrate the relationship between the given set of vector fields. This approach quantitatively measures the similarity and dissimilarity between vector fields. It is ideal for data compression of a large flow field, since only the number and types of critical points along with their corresponding /spl alpha/ and /spl beta/ parameters are necessary to reconstruct the whole field. It can also be used to better quantify the changes in time-varying data sets.","article_number":"745291","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=745291","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/745291/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '98 (Cat.

Given N sets of scattered data representing N distinct dependent variables that have been sampled independently over a common domain and N error tolerance values, the algorithm constructs a triangulation of the domain of the data and associates multivariate values with the vertices of the triangulation. The resulting linear interpolation of these multivariate values yields a multivariate function, called a co-triangulation, that represents all of the dependent data up to the given error tolerance. A simple iterative algorithm for the construction of a co-triangulation from any number of data sets is presented and analyzed. The main contribution of this paper lies in the description of a highly efficient framework for the realization of this approximation algorithm. While the asymptotic time complexity of the algorithm certainly remains within the theoretical bounds, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve running times that depend only linearly on the number of data even for very large problems with more than two million samples. This efficient realization of the algorithm uses adapted dynamic data structures and careful caching in an integrated framework.","article_number":"745293","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=745293","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/745293/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '98 (Cat.

We show applications of both approaches in hydrodynamic flows.","article_number":"745333","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=745333","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/745333/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '98 (Cat.

While the latest isosurface extraction methods have effectively eliminated the search phase bottleneck, the cost of constructing and rendering the isosurface remains high. Many of today's large datasets contain very large and complex isosurfaces that can easily overwhelm even state-of-the-art graphics hardware.

Instruments measuring corneal shape conventionally visualize the surface characteristics by mapping the instantaneous radius of curvature onto a rainbow colour scale. This technique is known to have important drawbacks. Firstly, not corneal shape itself is visualized, but rather second order surface properties. Secondly, the type of colouring produces well documented artifacts. We discuss visualization techniques for a more direct representation of the data. In a three part display, shape deviations are presented as a height surface in one window, height lines superimposed over the input image in another, and a colour mapped representation of the mean normal radius of curvature in a third. With the aid of some typical examples, it is shown that these visualizations are easy to interpret by the physician and overcome the limitations of the conventional techniques.","article_number":"745335","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=745335","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/745335/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '98 (Cat.

Our algorithm minimizes the main memory and disk space requirements on the visualization workstation, while speeding up isosurface extraction queries. Our overall approach is a two-level indexing scheme. First, by our meta-cell technique, we partition the original dataset into clusters of cells, called meta-cells. Secondly, we produce meta-intervals associated with the meta-cells, and build an indexing data structure on the meta-intervals. We separate the cell information, kept only in meta-cells on disk, from the indexing structure, which is also on disk and only contains pointers to meta-cells. Our meta-cell technique is an I/O-efficient approach for computing a k-d-tree-like partition of the dataset. Our indexing data structure, the binary blocked I/O interval tree, is a new I/O-optimal data structure to perform stabbing queries that report from a set of meta-intervals (or intervals) those containing a query value q. Our tree is simpler to implement, and is also more space-efficient in practice than existing structures. To perform an isosurface query, we first query the indexing structure, and then use the reported meta-cell pointers to read from disk the active meta-cells intersected by the isosurface. The isosurface itself can then be generated from active meta-cells. Rather than being a single cost indexing approach, our technique exhibits a smooth trade-off between query time and disk space.","article_number":"745299","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=745299","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/745299/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '98 (Cat.

The realization of these concepts results in a 3D-interface that allows users, especially engineers, to evaluate different configurations of a product and gives them direct access to the product structure. By applying various visualization techniques, product components and their attributes, e.g., their price, can be brought together into one visualization.

As a result the display of large textures is reduced to a caching problem in which texture memory serves as the primary cache for texture data, main memory the secondary cache, and local disk the tertiary cache.

Visualizing large amounts of spatially referenced data on a limited-size screen display often results in poor visualizations due to the high degree of overplotting of neighboring datapoints. We introduce a new approach to visualizing large amounts of spatially referenced data. The basic idea is to intelligently use the unoccupied pixels of the display instead of overplotting data points. After formally describing the problem, we present two solutions which are based on: placing overlapping data points on the nearest unoccupied pixel; and shifting data points along a screen-filling curve (e.g., Hilbert-curve). We then develop a more sophisticated approach called Gridfit, which is based on a hierarchical partitioning of the data space. We evaluate all three approaches with respect to their efficiency and effectiveness and show the superiority of the Gridfit approach. For measuring the effectiveness, we not only present the resulting visualizations but also introduce mathematical effectiveness criteria measuring properties of the generated visualizations with respect to the original data such as distance- and position-preservation.","article_number":"745301","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=745301","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/745301/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '98 (Cat.

Portals (doors and windows) are rendered by warping layered depth images (LDIs). In a preprocessing phase, for every portal, a number of pre-rendered images are combined into an LDI. The resulting LDI stores, exactly once, all surfaces visible in at least one of the images used in the construction, so most of the exposure errors are efficiently eliminated. The LDI can be warped in the McMillan occlusion compatible ordering. A substantial increase in performance is obtained by warping in parallel. Our parallelization scheme achieves good load balancing, scales with the number of processors, and preserves the occlusion compatible ordering. A fast, conservative reference-image-space clipping algorithm also reduces the warping effort.","article_number":"745305","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=745305","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/745305/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '98 (Cat.

Presently, two main variants of the splatting algorithm exist: (i) the original method, in which all splats are composited back-to-front, and (ii) the sheet-buffer method, in which the splats are added in cache-sheets, aligned with the volume face most parallel to the image plane, which are subsequently composited back-to-front. The former method is prone to cause bleeding artifacts from hidden objects, while the latter method reduces bleeding, but causes very visible color popping artifacts when the orientation of the compositing sheets changes suddenly as the image screen becomes more parallel to another volume face. We present a new variant of the splatting algorithm in which the compositing sheets are always parallel to the image plane, eliminating the condition for popping, while maintaining the insensitivity to color bleeding. This enables pleasing animated viewing of volumetric objects without temporal color and lighting discontinuities. The method uses a hierarchy of partial splats and employs an efficient list-based volume traversal scheme for fast splat access. It also offers more accuracy for perspective splatting as the decomposition of the individual splats facilitates a better approximation to the diverging nature of the rays that traverse the splatting kernels.","article_number":"745309","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=745309","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/745309/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '98 (Cat.

This makes our approach dependent only on local attributes of a point (position, normal and its derivatives) and independent of the global shape and topology of an object. Our method can map high resolution images on low resolution volumes, hence enhancing the visual appearance of rendered volume data.
