"Advanced battlespace network visualization techniques are required within the modern Air Operations Center (AOC) to improve cross-domain situation awareness and to support planning and decision-making. We present a visualization toolkit to address this need that supports the integration of network health and status information and meta-information with other traditional AOC information resources and activities across air, space, and cyber domains. Applications include the development of battlespace visualization technologies that will improve warfighters' decision-making response time and provide enhanced flexibility for mission planning by efficiently revealing affordances for leveraging, disrupting, or enhancing network connectivity.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5651192/","LOCKED","5651192","Charles River Analytics","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38557234400","1","J.

"Since its inception, the field of visual analytics has undergone tremendous growth in understanding how to create interactive visual tools to solve analytical problems. However, with few exceptions, most of these tools have been designed for single users in desktop environments. While often effective on their own, most single-user systems do not reflect the collaborative nature of solving real-world analytical tasks. Many intelligence analysts, for example, have been observed to switch repeatedly between working alone and collaborating with members of a small team. In this paper, we propose that a complete visual analytical system designed for solving real-world tasks ought to have two integrated components: a single-user desktop system and a mirroring system suitable for a collaborative environment.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652958/","LOCKED","5652958","Univ. of the District of Columbia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37400451800","1","Dong Hyun Jeong","37400451800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Univ. of Southern California","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37297278600","2","Evan Suma","37297278600","Univ. of North Carolina at Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591215700","3","Thomas Butkiewicz","37591215700","Univ. of North Carolina at Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300425000","4","William Ribarsky","37300425000","Tufts University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592409400","5","Remco Chang","37592409400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","0","25-26 Oct. 2010","Salt Lake City, UT, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2010.5652958","232","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652958/","","","","","","","","Collaboration","Visual analytics","Mice","Switches","Rendering (computer graphics)","Collaborative work","","5649053","978-1-4244-9488-0","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9488-0","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9487-3","10EX4986","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652958","25-26 Oct. 2010","5638583","2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2010","IEEE","2","231","A continuous analysis process between desktop and collaborative visual analytics environments"
"In command and control (C2) environments, decision makers must rapidly understand and address key temporal relationships that exist between critical tasks as conditions fluctuate. However, traditional temporal displays, such as mission timelines, fail to support user understanding of and reasoning about critical relationships. We have developed visualization methods to compactly and effectively convey key temporal constraints. In this paper, we present examples of our visualization approach and describe how we are exploring interaction methods within an integrated visualization workspace to support user awareness of temporal constraints.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5651617/","LOCKED","5651617","Charles River Analytics","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38557545000","1","Stephanie Dudzic","38557545000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Charles River Analytics","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38557234400","2","J.

"We present a unified framework for data processing, mining and interactive visualization of large-scale neuroanatomical databases. The input data is assumed to lie in a specific atlas space, or simply exist as a separate collection. Users can specify their own atlas for comparative analyses. The original data exist as MRI images in standard formats. It is uploaded to a remote server and processed offline by a parallelized pipeline workflow. This workflow transforms the data to represent it as both volumetric and triangular mesh cortical surfaces. We use multiresolution representations to scale complexity to data storage availability as well as graphical processing performance. Our workflow implements predefined metrics for clustering and classification, and data projection schemes to aid in visualization. Additionally the system provides a visual query interface for performing selection requests based on user-defined search criteria.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652532/","LOCKED","5652532","Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, Department of Neurology, UCLA School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, CA 90034","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37288595800","1","Shantanu H.

"The visual analysis of video content is an important research topic due to the huge amount of video data that is generated every day. Annotating this data will become a major problem since the amount of videos further increases. With this work we introduce a system that combines a visualization tool with automatic video segmentation techniques and a characteristic key-frame extraction. A summary of the content of a whole video in one view is realized. Furthermore, the user can interactively browse through the video via our visualization interface to get more detailed information.

"Every year since the article “How Will Big Pictures Emerge From a Sea of Biological Data?” appeared in Science, the question becomes more compelling. We are now accumulating information about biological sequences, structures, and interactions faster than we have the power to make sense of them. For hundreds of years prior to this, practical considerations coerced biological research into reductionism. There are simply too many components in a biological system for a biologist to examine the whole picture with the tools formerly available. Over the past decade this has rapidly changed as biological information has become cheap and plentiful due to the advent of high-throughput tools, making it possible for the frst time to ask questions on time and length scales that were previously intractable. The relaxation of the practical limitations on systems-level analysis has also brought a change in the philosophy of how we regard biology, moving towards a holistic method of research and interpretation. This places systems biology in stark contrast to traditional biological research, and for good reason. In the words of Denis Noble, “Systems biology is about putting together rather than taking apart, integration rather than reduction. It starts with what we have learned from the reductionist approach; and then it goes further.” This shift from reductionism is essential, for as we know from studying complex systems, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. With this new approach we are able to explore scientifc territory that has previously been untouched due to physical impossibility and philosophical differences. The complexity of the tangled web of nonlinear interactions between genes, proteins, and the environment necessitates the development of simplifed models to illuminate biological functions. Merely generating networks of interactions is not enough, providing us with far too much information in a single view without emphasizing the important features of the map. When we use Google maps and look at a picture of the United States it doesn't show us every city, we would never see Evanston, Illinois being shown at that level of detail. Only large and recognizable cities are shown to help us orient the map. Once we zoom in other smaller cities and features become visible, giving us more relevant information in a manner that is usable. Simply generating networks without any type of analysis or visualization is akin to showing a map of the United States with every state, city, and town marked on it. In my talk, I will describe the advances we have made in developing new visualization methods and the challenges still remaining.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652365/","LOCKED","5652365","Northwestern University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37603965400","1","Luis A.

"We present a custom visual analytics system developed in conjunction with the test and evaluation community of the US Army. We designed and implemented a visual programming environment for configuring a variety of interactive visual analysis capabilities. Our abstraction of the visualization process is based on insights gained from interviews conducted with expert users. We show that this model allowed analysts to implement multiple visual analysis capabilities for network performance, anomalous sensor activity, and engagement results. Long-term interaction with expert users led to development of several custom visual analysis techniques. We have conducted training sessions with expert users, and are working to evaluate the success of our work based on performance metrics captured in a semi-automated fashion during these training sessions. We have also integrated collaborative analysis features such as annotations and shared content.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5650219/","LOCKED","5650219","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Texas A&M University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586886600","1","Derek Overby","37586886600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Texas A&M University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282588300","2","John Keyser","37282588300","Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Texas A&M University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38225331100","3","Jim Wall","38225331100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","25-26 Oct. 2010","Salt Lake City, UT, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2010.5650219","248","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5650219/","Visualization system and toolkit design","","","","","","","Data visualization","Visual analytics","Communities","Analytical models","Training","Data models","","5649053","978-1-4244-9488-0","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9488-0","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9487-3","10EX4986","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5650219","25-26 Oct. 2010","5638583","2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2010","IEEE","9","247","ProDV — A case study in delivering visual analytics"

"We present an iterative strategy for finding a relevant subset of attributes for the purpose of classification in high-dimensional, heterogeneous data sets. The attribute subset is used for the construction of a classifier function. In order to cope with the challenge of scalability, the analysis is split into an overview of all attributes and a detailed analysis of small groups of attributes. The overview provides generic information on statistical dependencies between attributes. With this information the user can select groups of attributes and an analytical method for their detailed analysis. The detailed analysis involves the identification of redundant attributes (via classification or regression) and the creation of summarizing attributes (via clustering or dimension reduction). Our strategy does not prescribe specific analytical methods. Instead, we recursively combine the results of different methods to find or generate a subset of attributes to use for classification.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5654445/","LOCKED","5654445","Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics Research","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37603783600","1","Thorsten May","37603783600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics Research","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37603822500","2","James Davey","37603822500","Fraunhofer Institute for, Computer Graphics, Research","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37449689200","3","Jörn Kohlhammer","37449689200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","0","25-26 Oct. 2010","Salt Lake City, UT, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2010.5654445","240","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5654445/","High-Dimensional Data","Dimensionality Reduction","Data Clustering","Data Filtering","","","","Visualization","Data visualization","Clustering methods","Testing","USA Councils","Electronic mail","","5649053","978-1-4244-9488-0","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9488-0","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9487-3","10EX4986","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5654445","25-26 Oct. 2010","5638583","2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2010","IEEE","11","239","Combining statistical independence testing, visual attribute selection and automated analysis to find relevant attributes for classification"
"The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm is a popular and widely used cluster algorithm. Its constraint to organize clusters on a grid structure makes it very amenable to visualization. On the other hand, the grid constraint may lead to reduced cluster accuracy and reliability, compared to other clustering methods not implementing this restriction. We propose a visual cluster analysis system that allows to validate the output of the SOM algorithm by comparison with alternative clustering methods. Specifically, visual mappings overlaying alternative clustering results onto the SOM are proposed. We apply our system on an example data set, and outline main analytical use cases.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5651676/","LOCKED","5651676","Interactive Graphics Systems Group, TU Darmstadt, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606179600","1","Jürgen Bernard","37606179600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Interactive Graphics Systems Group, TU Darmstadt, Germany, and, Fraunhofer IGD, Darmstadt","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586276100","2","Tatiana von Landesberger","37586276100","Interactive Graphics Systems Group, TU Darmstadt, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586274500","3","Sebastian Bremm","37586274500","Interactive Graphics Systems Group, TU Darmstadt, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282557600","4","Tobias Schreck","37282557600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","0","25-26 Oct. 2010","Salt Lake City, UT, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2010.5651676","218","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5651676/","H.4 [Information Systems]: Information Systems Applications","I.3.6 [Computing Methodologies]: Methodology and Techniques","","","","","","Clustering algorithms","Data visualization","Trajectory","Visualization","Image color analysis","Clustering methods","Algorithm design and analysis","5649053","978-1-4244-9488-0","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9488-0","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9487-3","10EX4986","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5651676","25-26 Oct. 2010","5638583","2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2010","IEEE","12","217","Cluster correspondence views for enhanced analysis of SOM displays"

"Predicting protein structures has long been a grand-challenge problem. Fine-grained computational simulation of folding events from a protein's synthesis to its final stable structure remains computationally intractable. Therefore, methods which derive constraints from other sources are attractive. To date, constraints derived from known structures have proven to be highly successful. However, these cannot be applied to molecules with no identifiable neighbors having already-determined structures. For such molecules, structural constraints must be derived in other ways. One popular approach has been the statistical analysis of large families of proteins, with the hope that residues that “change together” (co-evolve) imply that those residues are in contact. Unfortunately, despite repeated attempts to use this data to deduce structural constraints, this approach has met with minimal success. The consensus of current literature concludes that there is simply too little information contained within the correlated mutations of many protein families to reliably and generally predict structural constraints. Recent work in my laboratory challenges this conclusion. For some time we have been developing methods (MAVL/StickWRLD) to visualize the pattern of co-evolved mutations within sequence families. While our analysis of individual correlations agrees with the literature consensus, we have recently discovered that the visualized pattern of correlations is highly suggestive of structural relationships. In our preliminary test cases, human researchers can unambiguously determine many positive structural constraints by visual analysis of statistical sequence information alone, often with no training on interpretation of the visualization results. Herein we report the visualization design that supports this Visual Analytics approach to identifying high-confidence hypotheses about protein folding from protein sequence, and illustrate preliminary results from this research. Our approach entails a higher-dimensional extension of parallel coordinates which illuminates distant shared sub-tuples of the vectors representing each protein sequence when these sub-tuples occur with an over abundance compared to expectations. It simultaneously eliminates all representations of tuples which occur with frequency near the expected norm. The result is a minimally-occluded representation of outlier, and only outlier co-occurrences within the sequence families.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5650199/","LOCKED","5650199","The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, The Ohio State University Biophysics Program","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37270070300","1","William C.

"Optimization problems are typically addressed by purely automatic approaches. For multi-objective problems, however, a single best solution often does not exist. In this case, it is necessary to analyze trade-offs between many conflicting goals within a given application context. This poster describes an approach that tightly integrates automatic algorithms for multi-objective optimization and interactive multivariate visualizations. Ad-hoc selections support a flexible definition of input data for subsequent algorithms. These algorithms in turn represent their result as derived data attributes that can be assigned to visualizations or be used as a basis for further selections (e.g., to constrain the result set). This enables a guided search that still involves the knowledge of domain experts. We describe our approach in the context of multi-run simulation data from the application domain of car engine design.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5651694/","LOCKED","5651694","VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546977900","1","Wolfgang Berger","37546977900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282562500","2","Harald Piringer","37282562500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5","1","25-26 Oct. 2010","Salt Lake City, UT, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2010.5651694","216","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5651694/","H.1.2 [Models and Principles]: User/Machine Systems-Human factors","H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: User Interfaces-Interaction Styles","","","","","","Optimization","Engines","Data visualization","Context","Load modeling","Visual analytics","","5649053","978-1-4244-9488-0","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9488-0","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9487-3","10EX4986","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5651694","25-26 Oct. 2010","5638583","2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2010","IEEE","18","215","Interactive visual analysis of multiobjective optimizations"
"In this paper, we introduce ALIDA, an Active Learning Intent Discerning Agent for visual analytics interfaces. As users interact with and explore data in a visual analytics environment they are each developing their own unique analytic process. The goal of ALIDA is to observe and record the human-computer interactions and utilize these observations as a means of supporting user exploration; ALIDA does this by using interaction to make decision about user interest. As such, ALIDA is designed to track the decision history (interactions) of a user. This history is then utilized to enhance the user's decision-making process by allowing the user to return to previously visited search states, as well as providing suggestions of other search states that may be of interest based on past exploration modalities. The agent passes these suggestions (or decisions) back to an interactive visualization prototype, and these suggestions are used to guide the user, either by suggesting searches or changes to the visualization view. Current work has tested ALIDA under the exploration of homonyms for users wishing to explore word linkages within a dictionary. Ongoing work includes using ALIDA to guide users in transfer function design for volume rendering within scientific gateways.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5650854/","LOCKED","5650854","School of Interactive Arts + Technology - Simon Fraser University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403562900","1","Tera Marie Green","37403562900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Purdue Visual Analytics Center - Purdue University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396008400","2","Ross Maciejewski","37396008400","School of Interactive Arts + Technology - Simon Fraser University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37326092700","3","Steve DiPaola","37326092700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2","0","25-26 Oct. 2010","Salt Lake City, UT, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2010.5650854","224","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5650854/","artificial intelligence","cognition","intent discernment","volume rendering","","","","Cognition","Humans","Visual analytics","History","Data visualization","Rendering (computer graphics)","Transfer functions","5649053","978-1-4244-9488-0","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9488-0","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9487-3","10EX4986","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5650854","25-26 Oct. 2010","5638583","2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2010","IEEE","19","223","ALIDA: Using machine learning for intent discernment in visual analytics interfaces"
"The 5th VAST Challenge consisted of three mini-challenges that involved both intelligence analysis and bioinformatics. Teams could solve one, two or all three mini-challenges and assess the overall situation to enter the Grand Challenge. Mini-challenge one involved text reports about people and events giving information about arms dealers, situations in various countries and linkages between different countries. Mini-challenge two involved hospital admission and death records from various countries providing information about the spread of a world wide pandemic. Mini-challenge three involved genetic data to be used to identify the origin of the pandemic and the most dangerous viral mutations. The Grand Challenge was to determine how these various mini-challenges were connected. As always the goal was to analyze the data and provide novel interactive visualizations useful in the analytic process.

"Complex combinations of coordinated multiple views are increasingly used to design tools for highly interactive visual exploration and analysis of multidimensional data. While complex coordination patterns provide substantial utility through expressive querying, they also exhibit usability problems for users when learning required interaction sequences, recalling past queries, and interpreting visual states. As visual analysis tools grow more sophisticated, there is a growing need to make them more understandable as well. Our long-term goal is to exploit natural language familiarity and literacy to directly facilitate individual and collaborative use of visual analysis tools. In this poster, we present work in progress on an automatically generated query-to-question user interface to translate interactive states during visual analysis into an accompanying visual log of formatted text. Our effort currently focuses on a symmetric and thus relatively simple coordination pattern: cross-filtered views. We describe our current thinking about query-to-question translation in a typical cross-filtered visualization of movies, people, and genres in the Internet Movie Database.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5650251/","LOCKED","5650251","School of Computer Science and Center for Spatial Analysis The University of Oklahoma","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593329400","1","Maryam Nafari","37593329400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","School of Computer Science and Center for Spatial Analysis The University of Oklahoma","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564883300","2","Chris Weaver","37564883300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","25-26 Oct. 2010","Salt Lake City, UT, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2010.5650251","246","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5650251/","Coordinated multiple views","cross-filtered queries","interaction states","natural language generation","visual provenance","","","Visualization","Data visualization","Natural languages","Motion pictures","Weaving","Internet","Encoding","5649053","978-1-4244-9488-0","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9488-0","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9487-3","10EX4986","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5650251","25-26 Oct. 2010","5638583","2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2010","IEEE","21","245","Poster: Translating cross-filtered queries into questions"

"The detection of previously unknown, frequently occurring patterns in time series, often called motifs, has been recognized as an important task. To find these motifs, we use an advanced temporal data mining algorithm. Since our algorithm usually finds hundreds of motifs, we need to analyze and access the discovered motifs. For this purpose, we introduce three novel visual analytics methods: (1) motif layout, using colored rectangles for visualizing the occurrences and hierarchical relationships of motifs in a multivariate time series, (2) motif distortion, for enlarging or shrinking motifs as appropriate for easy analysis and (3) motif merging, to combine a number of identical adjacent motif instances without cluttering the display. We have applied and evaluated our methods using two real-world data sets: data center cooling and oil well production.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5650766/","LOCKED","5650766","Hewlett Packard Laboratories, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274264300","1","M.

"The massive amount of financial time series data that originates from the stock market generates large amounts of complex data of high interest. However, adequate solutions that can effectively handle the information in order to gain insight and to understand the market mechanisms are rare. In this paper, we present two techniques and applications that enable the user to interactively analyze large amounts of time series data in real-time in order to get insight into the development of assets, market sectors, countries, and the financial market as a whole. The first technique allows users to quickly analyze combinations of single assets, market sectors as well as countries, compare them to each other, and to visually discover the periods of time where market sectors and countries get into turbulence. The second application clusters a selection of large amounts of financial time series data according to their similarity, and analyzes the distribution of the assets among market sectors. This allows users to identify the characteristic graphs which are representative for the development of a particular market sector, and also to identify the assets which behave considerably differently compared to other assets in the same sector. Both applications allow the user to perform investigative exploration techniques and interactive visual analysis in real-time.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652530/","LOCKED","5652530","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606028000","1","Hartmut Ziegler","37606028000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37589560900","2","Marco Jenny","37589560900","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37589560700","3","Tino Gruse","37589560700","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","4","Daniel A.

"DimStiller is a system for dimensionality reduction and analysis. It frames the task of understanding and transforming input dimensions as a series of analysis steps where users transform data tables by chaining together different techniques, called operators, into pipelines of expressions. The individual operators have controls and views that are linked together based on the structure of the expression. Users interact with the operator controls to tune parameter choices, with immediate visual feedback guiding the exploration of local neighborhoods of the space of possible data tables. DimStiller also provides global guidance for navigating data-table space through expression templates called workflows, which permit re-use of common patterns of analysis.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652392/","LOCKED","5652392","University of British Columbia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37587716200","1","Stephen Ingram","37587716200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of British Columbia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349490300","2","Tamara Munzner","37349490300","University of Victoria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37589529600","3","Veronika Irvine","37589529600","University of Victoria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275861300","4","Melanie Tory","37275861300","Simon Fraser University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37418878100","5","Steven Bergner","37418878100","Simon Fraser University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275858700","6","Torsten Möller","37275858700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","43","0","25-26 Oct. 2010","Salt Lake City, UT, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2010.5652392","10","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652392/","","","","","","","","Pipelines","Image color analysis","Visualization","Algorithm design and analysis","Correlation","Aerospace electronics","Noise","5649053","978-1-4244-9488-0","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9488-0","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9487-3","10EX4986","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652392","25-26 Oct. 2010","5638583","2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2010","IEEE","28","3","DimStiller: Workflows for dimensional analysis and reduction"
"Text visualization becomes an increasingly more important research topic as the need to understand massive-scale textual information is proven to be imperative for many people and businesses. However, it is still very challenging to design effective visual metaphors to represent large corpora of text due to the unstructured and high-dimensional nature of text. In this paper, we propose a data model that can be used to represent most of the text corpora. Such a data model contains four basic types of facets: time, category, content (unstructured), and structured facet. To understand the corpus with such a data model, we develop a hybrid visualization by combining the trend graph with tag-clouds. We encode the four types of data facets with four separate visual dimensions. To help people discover evolutionary and correlation patterns, we also develop several visual interaction methods that allow people to interactively analyze text by one or more facets. Finally, we present two case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution in support of multi-faceted visual analysis of text corpora.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652931/","LOCKED","5652931","IBM Research - China, 19 Zhongguancun Software Park, Beijing 100193, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37287511900","1","Lei Shi","37287511900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IBM Research - China, 19 Zhongguancun Software Park, Beijing 100193, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396839900","2","Furu Wei","37396839900","IBM Research - China, 19 Zhongguancun Software Park, Beijing 100193, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406039100","3","Shixia Liu","37406039100","IBM Research - China, 19 Zhongguancun Software Park, Beijing 100193, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37597343100","4","Li Tan","37597343100","IBM Research - China, 19 Zhongguancun Software Park, Beijing 100193, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604004300","5","Xiaoxiao Lian","37604004300","IBM Research - Almaden, 650 Harry Road San Jose, CA 95120, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399569300","6","Michelle X.

"Information foraging and sensemaking with heterogeneous information are context-dependent activities. Thus visual analytics tools to support these activities must incorporate context. But, context is a difficult concept to define, model, and represent. Creating and representing context in support of visually-enabled reasoning about complex problems with complex information is a complementary but different challenge than that addressed in context-aware computing. In the latter, the goal is automated adaptation of the system to meet user needs for applications such as mobile location-based services where information about the location, the user, and the user goals filters what gets presented on a small mobile device. In contrast, for visual analytics-enabled information foraging and sensemaking, the user is likely to take an active role in foraging for the contextual information needed to support sensemaking in relation to some multifaceted problem. In this paper, we address the challenges of constructing and representing context within visual interfaces that support analytical reasoning in crisis management and humanitarian relief. The challenges stem from the diverse forms of information that can provide context and difficulty in defining and operationalizing context itself. Here, we pay particular attention to document foraging to support construction of the geographic and historical context within which monitoring and sensemaking can be carried out. Specifically, we present the concept of geo-historical context (GHC) and outline an empirical assessment of both the concept and its implementation in the Context Discovery Application, a web-based tool that supports document foraging and sensemaking.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652895/","LOCKED","5652895","Department of Information Sciences and Technologies, Rochester Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591184300","1","Brian Tomaszewski","37591184300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GeoVISTA Center, Dept. of Geography, The Pennsylvania State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37374699000","2","Alan M.

"Modern machine learning techniques provide robust approaches for data-driven modeling and critical information extraction, while human experts hold the advantage of possessing high-level intelligence and domain-specific expertise. We combine the power of the two for anomaly detection in GPS data by integrating them through a visualization and human-computer interaction interface. In this paper we introduce GPSvas (GPS Visual Analytics System), a system that detects anomalies in GPS data using the approach of visual analytics: a conditional random field (CRF) model is used as the machine learning component for anomaly detection in streaming GPS traces. A visualization component and an interactive user interface are built to visualize the data stream, display significant analysis results (i.e., anomalies or uncertain predications) and hidden information extracted by the anomaly detection model, which enable human experts to observe the real-time data behavior and gain insights into the data flow. Human experts further provide guidance to the machine learning model through the interaction tools; the learning model is then incrementally improved through an active learning procedure.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652467/","LOCKED","5652467","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591746700","1","Zicheng Liao","37591746700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37578164900","2","Yizhou Yu","37578164900","Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37600013700","3","Baoquan Chen","37600013700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","45","17","25-26 Oct. 2010","Salt Lake City, UT, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2010.5652467","58","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652467/","H.1.2 [Models and Principles]: User/Machine Systems-Human information processing","H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: User Interfaces-Graphics user interfaces","I.5.2 [Pattern Recognition]: Design Methodology-Pattern analysis","Feature evaluation and selection","","","","Global Positioning System","Data visualization","Data models","Histograms","Training","Humans","Machine learning","5649053","978-1-4244-9488-0","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9488-0","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9487-3","10EX4986","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652467","25-26 Oct. 2010","5638583","2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2010","IEEE","31","51","Anomaly detection in GPS data based on visual analytics"
"In risk assessment applications well informed decisions are made based on huge amounts of multi-dimensional data. In many domains not only the risk of a wrong decision, but in particular the trade-off between the costs of possible decisions are of utmost importance. In this paper we describe a framework tightly integrating interactive visual exploration with machine learning to support the decision making process. The proposed approach uses a series of interactive 2D visualizations of numeric and ordinal data combined with visualization of classification models. These series of visual elements are further linked to the classifier's performance visualized using an interactive performance curve. An interactive decision point on the performance curve allows the decision maker to steer the classification model and instantly identify the critical, cost changing data elements, in the various linked visualizations. The critical data elements are represented as images in order to trigger associations related to the knowledge of the expert. In this context the data visualization and classification results are not only linked together, but are also linked back to the classification model. Such a visual analytics framework allows the user to interactively explore the costs of his decisions for different settings of the model and accordingly use the most suitable classification model and make more informed and reliable decisions. A case study on data from the Forensic Psychiatry domain reveals the usefulness of the suggested approach.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652398/","LOCKED","5652398","Intelligent Systems Lab Amsterdam, University of Amsterdam","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37589528300","1","Malgorzata Migut","37589528300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Intelligent Systems Lab Amsterdam, University of Amsterdam","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267865600","2","Marcel Worring","37267865600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","18","1","25-26 Oct. 2010","Salt Lake City, UT, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2010.5652398","18","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652398/","Visual Analytics","Interactive Visual Exploration","Decision Boundary Visualization","Multi-dimensional Space","Classification","","","Data visualization","Risk management","Visualization","Data models","Image color analysis","Context","Forensics","5649053","978-1-4244-9488-0","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9488-0","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9487-3","10EX4986","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652398","25-26 Oct. 2010","5638583","2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2010","IEEE","32","11","Visual exploration of classification models for risk assessment"
"The final product of an analyst's investigation using a visualization is often a report of the discovered knowledge, as well as the methods employed and reasoning behind the discovery. We believe that analysts may have difficulty keeping track of their knowledge discovery process and will require tools to assist in accurately recovering their reasoning. We first report on a study examining analysts' recall of their strategies and methods, demonstrating their lack of memory of the path of knowledge discovery. We then explore whether a tool visualizing the steps of the visual analysis can aid users in recalling their reasoning process. The results of our second study indicate that visualizations of interaction logs can serve as an effective memory aid, allowing analysts to recall additional details of their strategies and decisions.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5653598/","LOCKED","5653598","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601288800","1","Heather Richter Lipford","37601288800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601289000","2","Felesia Stukes","37601289000","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606064200","3","Wenwen Dou","37606064200","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601287300","4","Matthew E.

"Diagnosing faults in an operational computer network is a frustrating, time-consuming exercise. Despite advances, automatic diagnostic tools are far from perfect: they occasionally miss the true culprit and are mostly only good at narrowing down the search to a few potential culprits. This uncertainty and the inability to extract useful sense from tool output renders most tools not usable to administrators. To bridge this gap, we present NetClinic, a visual analytics system that couples interactive visualization with an automated diagnostic tool for enterprise networks. It enables administrators to verify the output of the automatic analysis at different levels of detail and to move seamlessly across levels while retaining appropriate context. A qualitative user study shows that NetClinic users can accurately identify the culprit, even when it is not present in the suggestions made by the automated component. We also find that supporting a variety of sensemaking strategies is a key to the success of systems that enhance automated diagnosis.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652910/","LOCKED","5652910","Microsoft Research, Georgia Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592993600","1","Zhicheng Liu","37592993600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Microsoft Research","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37293389400","2","Bongshin Lee","37293389400","Microsoft Research","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591286400","3","Srikanth Kandula","37591286400","Microsoft Research","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37603074200","4","Ratul Mahajan","37603074200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","9","0","25-26 Oct. 2010","Salt Lake City, UT, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2010.5652910","138","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652910/","Sensemaking","Semantic Graph Layout","Visual Analytics","Network Diagnosis","Information Visualization","","","Layout","Radiation detectors","Visualization","Cognition","Electronic mail","Semantics","Servers","5649053","978-1-4244-9488-0","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9488-0","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9487-3","10EX4986","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652910","25-26 Oct. 2010","5638583","2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2010","IEEE","34","131","NetClinic: Interactive visualization to enhance automated fault diagnosis in enterprise networks"
"Co-located collaboration can be extremely valuable during complex visual analytics tasks. This paper presents an exploratory study of a system designed to support collaborative visual analysis tasks on a digital tabletop display. Fifteen participant pairs employed Cam-biera, a visual analytics system, to solve a problem involving 240 digital documents. Our analysis, supported by observations, system logs, questionnaires, and interview data, explores how pairs approached the problem around the table. We contribute a unique, rich understanding of how users worked together around the table and identify eight types of collaboration styles that can be used to identify how closely people work together while problem solving. We show how the closeness of teams' collaboration influenced how well they performed on the task overall. We further discuss the role of the tabletop for visual analytics tasks and derive novel design implications for future co-located collaborative tabletop problem solving systems.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652880/","LOCKED","5652880","INRIA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591317800","1","Petra Isenberg","37591317800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Microsoft Research","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37542391000","2","Danyel Fisher","37542391000","Microsoft Research","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37600344900","3","Meredith Ringel Morris","37600344900","Microsoft Research","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37562971500","4","Kori Inkpen","37562971500","Microsoft Research","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37563799500","5","Mary Czerwinski","37563799500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","43","2","25-26 Oct. 2010","Salt Lake City, UT, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2010.5652880","186","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652880/","K.5.3 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: Group and Organization Interfaces","","","","","","","Collaboration","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Problem-solving","Image color analysis","Context","Video coding","5649053","978-1-4244-9488-0","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9488-0","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9487-3","10EX4986","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652880","25-26 Oct. 2010","5638583","2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2010","IEEE","35","179","An exploratory study of co-located collaborative visual analytics around a tabletop display"
"Data sets in astronomy are growing to enormous sizes. Modern astronomical surveys provide not only image data but also catalogues of millions of objects (stars, galaxies), each object with hundreds of associated parameters. Exploration of this very high-dimensional data space poses a huge challenge. Subspace clustering is one among several approaches which have been proposed for this purpose in recent years. However, many clustering algorithms require the user to set a large number of parameters without any guidelines. Some methods also do not provide a concise summary of the datasets, or, if they do, they lack additional important information such as the number of clusters present or the significance of the clusters. In this paper, we propose a method for ranking subspaces for clustering which overcomes many of the above limitations. First we carry out a transformation from parametric space to discrete image space where the data are represented by a grid-based density field. Then we apply so-called connected morphological operators on this density field of astronomical objects that provides visual support for the analysis of the important subspaces. Clusters in subspaces correspond to high-intensity regions in the density image. The importance of a cluster is measured by a new quality criterion based on the dynamics of local maxima of the density. Connected operators are able to extract such regions with an indication of the number of clusters present. The subspaces are visualized during computation of the quality measure, so that the user can interact with the system to improve the results. In the result stage, we use three visualization toolkits linked within a graphical user interface so that the user can perform an in-depth exploration of the ranked subspaces. Evaluation based on synthetic as well as real astronomical datasets demonstrates the power of the new method. We recover various known astronomical relations directly from the data with little or no a priori assumptions. Hence, our method holds good prospects for discovering new relations as well.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652450/","LOCKED","5652450","Johann Bernoulli Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Groningen","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37589434200","1","Bilkis J.

"Journalists increasingly turn to social media sources such as Facebook or Twitter to support their coverage of various news events. For large-scale events such as televised debates and speeches, the amount of content on social media can easily become overwhelming, yet still contain information that may aid and augment reporting via individual content items as well as via aggregate information from the crowd's response. In this work we present a visual analytic tool, Vox Civitas, designed to help journalists and media professionals extract news value from large-scale aggregations of social media content around broadcast events. We discuss the design of the tool, present the text analysis techniques used to enable the presentation, and provide details on the visual and interaction design. We provide an exploratory evaluation based on a user study in which journalists interacted with the system to explore and report on a dataset of over one hundred thousand twitter messages collected during the U.S. State of the Union presidential address in 2010.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652922/","LOCKED","5652922","Rutgers University, School of Communication and Information","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591165700","1","Nicholas Diakopoulos","37591165700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Rutgers University, School of Communication and Information","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282106600","2","Mor Naaman","37282106600","Rutgers University, School of Communication and Information","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38276630800","3","Funda Kivran-Swaine","38276630800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","95","2","25-26 Oct. 2010","Salt Lake City, UT, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2010.5652922","122","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652922/","Computational Journalism","Computer Assisted Reporting","Social Media","Sensemaking","","","","Media","Twitter","Aggregates","Context","Classification algorithms","Filtering","Visual analytics","5649053","978-1-4244-9488-0","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9488-0","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9487-3","10EX4986","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652922","25-26 Oct. 2010","5638583","2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2010","IEEE","37","115","Diamonds in the rough: Social media visual analytics for journalistic inquiry"
"Finding patterns in temporal data is an important data analysis task in many domains. Static visualizations can help users easily see certain instances of patterns, but are not specially designed to support systematic analysis tasks, such as finding all instances of a pattern automatically. VizPattern is an interactive visual query environment that uses a comic strip metaphor to enable users to easily and quickly define and locate complex temporal patterns. Evaluations provide evidence that VizPattern is applicable in many domains, and that it enables a wide variety of users to answer questions about temporal data faster and with fewer errors than existing state-of-the-art visual analysis systems.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652890/","LOCKED","5652890","Information Sciences Institute University of Southern California","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37600357600","1","Jing Jin","37600357600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Information Sciences Institute University of Southern California","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591247400","2","Pedro Szekely","37591247400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","14","0","25-26 Oct. 2010","Salt Lake City, UT, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2010.5652890","170","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652890/","H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: User Interface-User-centered design","H.3.3 [Information Systems]: Information Search and Retrieval-Query formulation","","","","","","Strips","Data visualization","Pain","Time series analysis","Visualization","Stomach","Data analysis","5649053","978-1-4244-9488-0","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9488-0","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9487-3","10EX4986","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652890","25-26 Oct. 2010","5638583","2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2010","IEEE","38","163","Interactive querying of temporal data using a comic strip metaphor"
"Visualization of multi-dimensional data is challenging due to the number of complex correlations that may be present in the data but that are difficult to be visually identified. One of the main causes for this problem is the inherent loss of information that occurs when high-dimensional data is projected into 2D or 3D. Although 2D scatterplots are ubiquitous due to their simplicity and familiarity, there are not a lot of variations on their basic metaphor. In this paper, we present a new way of visualizing multidimensional data using scatterplots. We extend 2D scatterplots using sensitivity coefficients to highlight local variation of one variable with respect to another. When applied to a scatterplot, these sensitivities can be understood as velocities, and the resulting visualization resembles a flow field. We also present a number of operations, based on flow-field analysis, that help users navigate, select and cluster points in an efficient manner. We show the flexibility and generality of this approach using a number of multidimensional data sets across different domains.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652460/","LOCKED","5652460","University of California at Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593323300","1","Yu-Hsuan Chan","37593323300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of California at Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282925900","2","Carlos D.

"We present a tool that is specifically designed to support a writer in revising a draft-version of a document. In addition to showing which paragraphs and sentences are difficult to read and understand, we assist the reader in understanding why this is the case. This requires features that are expressive predictors of readability, and are also semantically understandable. In the first part of the paper, we therefore discuss a semi-automatic feature selection approach that is used to choose appropriate measures from a collection of 141 candidate readability features. In the second part, we present the visual analysis tool VisRA, which allows the user to analyze the feature values across the text and within single sentences. The user can choose different visual representations accounting for differences in the size of the documents and the availability of information about the physical and logical layout of the documents. We put special emphasis on providing as much transparency as possible to ensure that the user can purposefully improve the readability of a sentence. Several case-studies are presented that show the wide range of applicability of our tool.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652926/","LOCKED","5652926","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591207400","1","Daniela Oelke","37591207400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601354600","2","David Spretke","37601354600","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592880100","3","Andreas Stoffel","37592880100","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","4","Daniel A.

"In this paper, we present a new web-based visual analytics system, VizCept, which is designed to support fluid, collaborative analysis of large textual intelligence datasets. The main approach of the design is to combine individual workspace and shared visualization in an integrated environment. Collaborating analysts will be able to identify concepts and relationships from the dataset based on keyword searches in their own workspace and collaborate visually with other analysts using visualization tools such as a concept map view and a timeline view. The system allows analysts to parallelize the work by dividing initial sets of concepts, investigating them on their own workspace, and then integrating individual findings automatically on shared visualizations with support for interaction and personal graph layout in real time, in order to develop a unified plot. We highlight several design considerations that promote communication and analytic performance in small team synchronous collaboration. We report the result of a pair of case study applications including collaboration and communication methods, analysis strategies, and user behaviors under a competition setting in the same location at the same time. The results of these demonstrate the tool's effectiveness for synchronous collaborative construction and use of visualizations in intelligence data analysis.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652932/","LOCKED","5652932","Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37597408500","1","Haeyong Chung","37597408500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37598427300","2","Seungwon Yang","37598427300","Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591135300","3","Naveed Massjouni","37591135300","Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37587847300","4","Christopher Andrews","37587847300","Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591136300","5","Rahul Kanna","37591136300","Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37419565900","6","Chris North","37419565900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15","5","25-26 Oct. 2010","Salt Lake City, UT, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2010.5652932","114","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652932/","Collaborative visualization","text and document data","intelligence analysis","","","","","Collaboration","Data visualization","Visual analytics","Layout","Servers","Keyword search","Text analysis","5649053","978-1-4244-9488-0","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9488-0","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9487-3","10EX4986","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652932","25-26 Oct. 2010","5638583","2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2010","IEEE","42","107","VizCept: Supporting synchronous collaboration for constructing visualizations in intelligence analysis"
"Wikipedia has been built to gather encyclopedic knowledge using a collaborative social process that has proved its effectiveness. However, the workload required for raising the quality and increasing the coverage of Wikipedia is exhausting the community. Based on several participatory design sessions with active Wikipedia contributors (a.k.a. Wikipedians), we have collected a set of measures related to Wikipedia activity that, if available and visualized effectively, could spare a lot of monitoring time to these Wikipedians, allowing them to focus on quality and coverage of Wikipedia instead of spending their time navigating heavily to track vandals and copyright infringements. However, most of these measures cannot be computed on the fly using the available Wikipedia API. Therefore, we have designed an open architecture called WikiReactive to compute incrementally and maintain several aggregated measures on the French Wikipedia. This aggregated data is available as a Web Service and can be used to overlay information on Wikipedia articles through Wikipedia Skins or for new services for Wikipedians or people studying Wikipedia.

"Modern visualization methods are needed to cope with very high-dimensional data. Efficient visual analytical techniques are required to extract the information content in these data. The large number of possible projections for each method, which usually grow quadrat-ically or even exponentially with the number of dimensions, urges the necessity to employ automatic reduction techniques, automatic sorting or selecting the projections, based on their information-bearing content. Different quality measures have been successfully applied for several specified user tasks and established visualization techniques, like Scatterplots, Scatterplot Matrices or Parallel Coordinates. Many other popular visualization techniques exist, but due to the structural differences, the measures are not directly applicable to them and new approaches are needed. In this paper we propose new quality measures for three popular visualization methods: Radviz, Pixel-Oriented Displays and Table Lenses. Our experiments show that these measures efficiently guide the visual analysis task.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652433/","LOCKED","5652433","TU Braunschweig, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37603943800","1","Georgia Albuquerque","37603943800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TU Braunschweig, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546817000","2","Martin Eisemann","37546817000","University of Magdeburg, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601992200","3","Dirk J.

"During the last decades, electronic textual information has become the world's largest and most important information source. Daily newspapers, books, scientific and governmental publications, blogs and private messages have grown into a wellspring of endless information and knowledge. Since neither existing nor new information can be read in its entirety, we rely increasingly on computers to extract and visualize meaningful or interesting topics and documents from this huge information reservoir. In this paper, we extend, improve and combine existing individual approaches into an overall framework that supports topologi-cal analysis of high dimensional document point clouds given by the well-known tf-idf document-term weighting method. We show that traditional distance-based approaches fail in very high dimensional spaces, and we describe an improved two-stage method for topology-based projections from the original high dimensional information space to both two dimensional (2-D) and three dimensional (3-D) visualizations. To demonstrate the accuracy and usability of this framework, we compare it to methods introduced recently and apply it to complex document and patent collections.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652940/","LOCKED","5652940","University of Leipzig","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403135200","1","Patrick Oesterling","37403135200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Leipzig","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282574800","2","Gerik Scheuermann","37282574800","University of Leipzig","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591211600","3","Sven Teresniak","37591211600","University of Leipzig","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591211200","4","Gerhard Heyer","37591211200","University of Stuttgart","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593029700","5","Steffen Koch","37593029700","University of Stuttgart","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268023800","6","Thomas Ertl","37268023800","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37411444100","7","Gunther H.

"Interaction and manual manipulation have been shown in the cognitive science literature to play a critical role in problem solving. Given different types of interactions or constraints on interactions, a problem can appear to have different degrees of difficulty. While this relationship between interaction and problem solving has been well studied in the cognitive science literatures, the visual analytics community has yet to exploit this understanding for analytical problem solving. In this paper, we hypothesize that constraints on interactions and constraints encoded in visual representations can lead to strategies of varying effectiveness during problem solving. To test our hypothesis, we conducted a user study in which participants were given different levels of interaction constraints when solving a simple math game called Number Scrabble. Number Scrabble is known to have an optimal visual problem isomorph, and the goal of this study is to learn if and how the participants could derive the isomorph and to analyze the strategies that the participants utilize in solving the problem. Our results indicate that constraints on interactions do affect problem solving, and that while the optimal visual isomorph is difficult to derive, certain interaction constraints can lead to a higher chance of deriving the isomorph.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5653599/","LOCKED","5653599","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606064200","1","Wenwen Dou","37606064200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37548028800","2","Caroline Ziemkiewicz","37548028800","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546111900","3","Lane Harrison","37546111900","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37400451800","4","Dong Hyun Jeong","37400451800","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37603814100","5","Roxanne Ryan","37603814100","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300425000","6","William Ribarsky","37300425000","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601069300","7","Xiaoyu Wang","37601069300","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592409400","8","Remco Chang","37592409400","","","","","","","","","","","4","0","25-26 Oct. 2010","Salt Lake City, UT, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2010.5653599","202","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5653599/","Interaction","Visual Isomorph","Problem Solving","","","","","Visualization","Games","Problem-solving","Time factors","Cognition","Computers","","5649053","978-1-4244-9488-0","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9488-0","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9487-3","10EX4986","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5653599","25-26 Oct. 2010","5638583","2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2010","IEEE","46","195","Comparing different levels of interaction constraints for deriving visual problem isomorphs"
"We present an interactive visual analytics system for classification, iVisClassifier, based on a supervised dimension reduction method, linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Given high-dimensional data and associated cluster labels, LDA gives their reduced dimensional representation, which provides a good overview about the cluster structure. Instead of a single two- or three-dimensional scatter plot, iVisClassifier fully interacts with all the reduced dimensions obtained by LDA through parallel coordinates and a scatter plot. Furthermore, it significantly improves the interactivity and interpretability of LDA. LDA enables users to understand each of the reduced dimensions and how they influence the data by reconstructing the basis vector into the original data domain. By using heat maps, iVisClassifier gives an overview about the cluster relationship in terms of pairwise distances between cluster centroids both in the original space and in the reduced dimensional space. Equipped with these functionalities, iVisClassifier supports users' classification tasks in an efficient way. Using several facial image data, we show how the above analysis is performed.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652443/","LOCKED","5652443","School of Computational Science and Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37602784600","1","Jaegul Choo","37602784600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37599320600","2","Hanseung Lee","37599320600","School of Interactive, Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592890600","3","Jaeyeon Kihm","37592890600","School of Computational Science and Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37277119500","4","Haesun Park","37277119500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","66","1","25-26 Oct. 2010","Salt Lake City, UT, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2010.5652443","34","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652443/","H.5.2 [INFORMATION INTERFACES AND PRESENTATION]: User Interfaces-Theory and methods","","","","","","","Data visualization","Image color analysis","Principal component analysis","Space heating","Pixel","Clustering algorithms","","5649053","978-1-4244-9488-0","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9488-0","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9487-3","10EX4986","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652443","25-26 Oct. 2010","5638583","2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2010","IEEE","47","27","iVisClassifier: An interactive visual analytics system for classification based on supervised dimension reduction"
"Events that happened in the past are important for understanding the ongoing processes, predicting future developments, and making informed decisions. Significant and/or interesting events tend to attract many people. Some people leave traces of their attendance in the form of computer-processable data, such as records in the databases of mobile phone operators or photos on photo sharing web sites. We developed a suite of visual analytics methods for reconstructing past events from these activity traces. Our tools combine geocomputations, interactive geovisualizations and statistical methods to enable integrated analysis of the spatial, temporal, and thematic components of the data, including numeric attributes and texts. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on two large real data sets, mobile phone calls in Milano during 9 days and flickr photos made on British Isles during 5 years.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652478/","LOCKED","5652478","Fraunhofer Institute IAIS (Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems), Sankt Augustin, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047100","1","Gennady Andrienko","37283047100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Fraunhofer Institute IAIS (Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems), Sankt Augustin, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047700","2","Natalia Andrienko","37283047700","Fraunhofer Institute IAIS (Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems), Sankt Augustin, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37545515700","3","Martin Mladenov","37545515700","Fraunhofer Institute IAIS (Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems), Sankt Augustin, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279597900","4","Michael Mock","37279597900","Fraunhofer Institute IAIS (Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems), Sankt Augustin, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37589346900","5","Christian Pölitz","37589346900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","20","0","25-26 Oct. 2010","Salt Lake City, UT, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2010.5652478","66","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652478/","event detection","spatio-temporal data","time series analysis","scalable visualization","geovisualization","","","Time series analysis","Correlation","Mobile handsets","Databases","Games","Shape","Visual analytics","5649053","978-1-4244-9488-0","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9488-0","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9487-3","10EX4986","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652478","25-26 Oct. 2010","5638583","2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2010","IEEE","48","59","Discovering bits of place histories from people's activity traces"
"Visual exploration and analysis is a process of discovering and dissecting the abundant and complex attribute relationships that pervade multidimensional data. Recent research has identified and characterized patterns of multiple coordinated views, such as cross-filtered views, in which rapid sequences of simple interactions can be used to express queries on subsets of attribute values. In visualizations designed around these patterns, for the most part, distinct views serve to visually isolate each attribute from the others. Although the brush-and-click simplicity of visual isolation facilitates discovery of many-to-many relationships between attributes, dissecting these relationships into more fine-grained one-to-many relationships is interactively tedious and, worse, visually fragmented over prolonged sequences of queries. This paper describes: (1) a method for interactively dissecting multidimensional data by iteratively slicing and manipulating a multigraph representation of data values and value co-occurrences; and (2) design strategies for extending the construction of coordinated multiple view interfaces for dissection as well as discovery of attribute relationships in multidimensional data sets. Using examples from different domains, we describe how attribute relationship graphs can be combined with cross-filtered views, modularized for reuse across designs, and integrated into broader visual analysis tools. The exploratory and analytic utility of these examples suggests that an attribute relationship graph would be a useful addition to a wide variety of visual analysis tools.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652520/","LOCKED","5652520","School of Computer Science and Center for Spatial Analysis The University of Oklahoma","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564883300","1","Chris Weaver","37564883300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10","3","25-26 Oct. 2010","Salt Lake City, UT, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2010.5652520","82","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652520/","D.2.2 [Software Engineering]: Design Tools and Techniques-[User Interfaces]","H.2.3 [Information Systems]: Database Management-[Languages]","H.5.2 [Information Systems]: Information Interfaces and Presentation-[User Interfaces]","","","","","Visualization","Awards activities","Motion pictures","Data visualization","Pipelines","Layout","Encoding","5649053","978-1-4244-9488-0","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9488-0","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9487-3","10EX4986","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652520","25-26 Oct. 2010","5638583","2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2010","IEEE","49","75","Multidimensional data dissection using attribute relationship graphs"
"The process of learning models from raw data typically requires a substantial amount of user input during the model initialization phase. We present an assistive visualization system which greatly reduces the load on the users and makes the process of model initialization and refinement more efficient, problem-driven, and engaging. Utilizing a sequence segmentation task with a Hidden Markov Model as an example, we assign each token in the sequence a feature vector based on its various properties within the sequence. These vectors are then clustered according to similarity, generating a layout of the individual tokens in form of a node link diagram where the length of the links is determined by the feature vector similarity. Users may then tune the weights of the feature vector components to improve the segmentation, which is visualized as a better separation of the clusters. Also, as individual clusters represent different classes, the user can now work at the cluster level to define token classes, instead of labelling one entry at time. Inconsistent entries visually identify themselves by locating at the periphery of clusters, and the user then helps refine the model by resolving these inconsistencies. Our system therefore makes efficient use of the knowledge of its users, only requesting user assistance for non-trivial data items. It so allows users to visually analyse data at a higher, more abstract level, improving scalability.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652484/","LOCKED","5652484","Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592970300","1","Supriya Garg","37592970300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284911300","2","I.

"This paper highlights the important role that record-keeping (i.e. taking notes and saving charts) plays in collaborative data analysis within the business domain. The discussion of record-keeping is based on observations from a user study in which co-located teams worked on collaborative visual analytics tasks using large interactive wall and tabletop displays. Part of our findings is a collaborative data analysis framework that encompasses note taking as one of the main activities. We observed that record-keeping was a critical activity within the analysis process. Based on our observations, we characterize notes according to their content, scope, and usage, and describe how they fit into a process of collaborative data analysis. We then discuss suggestions for the design of collaborative visual analytics tools.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652879/","LOCKED","5652879","University of Victoria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591344800","1","Narges Mahyar","37591344800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Victoria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591344300","2","Ali Sarvghad","37591344300","University of Victoria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275861300","3","Melanie Tory","37275861300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8","0","25-26 Oct. 2010","Salt Lake City, UT, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2010.5652879","178","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652879/","note taking","recording","collaboration","tabletop","wall display","history","provenance","Collaboration","Data visualization","Visual analytics","Software","Marketing and sales","Business","","5649053","978-1-4244-9488-0","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9488-0","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9487-3","10EX4986","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652879","25-26 Oct. 2010","5638583","2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2010","IEEE","51","171","A closer look at note taking in the co-located collaborative visual analytics process"
"Insight Externalization (IE) refers to the process of capturing and recording the semantics of insights in decision making and problem solving. To reduce human effort, Automated Insight Externalization (AIE) is desired. Most existing IE approaches achieve automation by capturing events (e.g., clicks and key presses) or actions (e.g., panning and zooming). In this paper, we propose a novel AIE approach named Click2Annotate. It allows semi-automatic insight annotation that captures low-level analytics task results (e.g., clusters and outliers), which have higher semantic richness and abstraction levels than actions and events. Click2Annotate has two significant benefits. First, it reduces human effort required in IE and generates annotations easy to understand. Second, the rich semantic information encoded in the annotations enables various insight management activities, such as insight browsing and insight retrieval. We present a formal user study that proved this first benefit.

"CZSaw is a visual analytics tool for sense-making across entities, documents, and relations with a focus on supporting the analysis process. It uses a variety of flexible data visualizations to represent and explore networks of entities and relations from different perspectives. CZSaw supports clustering documents and entities into smaller groups to make sense of them and weave individual facts into a complete picture. CZSaw also provides entity refinement functions to support interactive data cleaning. Its dependency propagation mechanism speeds the analysis sense-making loop by automatically synchronizing data and views, and propagating changes to the whole system.","","EPHEMERA","5653060","School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38182637400","1","Victor Chen","38182637400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601085600","2","Dustin Dunsmuir","37601085600","School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601001100","3","Saba Alimadadi","37601001100","School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37596074400","4","Eric Lee","37596074400","School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37605316500","5","Jeffrey Guenther","37605316500","School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37278563100","6","John Dill","37278563100","School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38585310400","7","Cheryl Qian","38585310400","School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37358198200","8","Chris D.

"Jim was born in Spokane, WA. He received his Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Eastern Washington University and his master's degree in Computer Science from Washington State University. Jim's infuence on our feld started in 1971 when he joined the General Motors Research Laboratories. He became a computer graphics researcher and worked on computer graphics systems to support the then new computer-aided design process. In retrospect, this early work and an ACM SIGGRAPH publication on creating interactive graphical systems for CAD foreshadowed Jim's effort to create new ways to use visualization to understand complex data.","","EPHEMERA","5652375","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604974900","1","David S.

"The VAST 2010 Challenge consisted of three separate datasets which we investigated with three student teams using three different tools in order to solve each Mini Challenge (MC1-3). The teams met to share findings, request supporting evidence from the other mini challenges, and raise questions for other teams to investigate further. We used CZSaw to investigate the MC1 arms dealer reports by organizing an overview before drilling down to investigate each country's activities. We used Tableau for MC2 to summarize the spread of the Drafa virus within each country and compare the times at which it occurred. We used the IMAS genomics tool for MC3 to discover the origin and initial spread of the virus.","","EPHEMERA","5653035","School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601085600","1","Dustin Dunsmuir","37601085600","School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38181028300","11","Robert Woodbury","38181028300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086796096","2","Mahshid Z.

"In response to the 2010 VAST Grand Challenge our team developed an analytical pipeline combining manual analysis with automated entity extraction and visualization tools to gain insight into the complex source documents associated with a fictional illegal arms dealing network spanning multiple countries. This data was then integrated with data hospital records information and genetic data from the associated virus to determine the origin of the outbreak, and to identify how it was spread to various countries. Using our methodologies we surmised that a Ukrainian group served as the central mediators for a variety of deals, and that these deals culminated in a meeting that was attended by representatives from most of the identified countries in this network. One of the early attendees of these meetings was infected with this Drafa Fever virus and subsequently spread it to other attendees who then spread the disease in their respective countries upon returning home. While this scenario was fictitious, the methods developed could be applied to real-world scenarios, and with some improvements, in near real-time which could potentially allow decision makers to prevent a future pandemic.","","EPHEMERA","5653004","Noblis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37594019600","1","C.

"In this paper, automated medical data analysis and visualisation are discussed. The task of the VAST 2010 Mini Challenge 2 was to characterize the spread of an epidemic outbreak. The analysis should take into consideration symptoms, mortality rates and temporal patterns of the disease. Finally, the outbreak should be compared across different locations searching for anomalies. For the preprocessing and the automated analysis of the data we used the Konstanz Information Miner (KINME), which is a modular data exploration platform that enables the user to visually create dataflows, the R software for statistical computing and some selfwritten Java programs for data preprocessing. For conducting the visual investigations we applied Many Eyes and Protovis, which compose scalable and customized views for datasets of interest.","","EPHEMERA","5653071","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601352900","1","Andrada Astefanoaie","37601352900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085934030","2","Rodica Bozianu","37085934030","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601356300","3","Marc Broghammer","37601356300","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601356600","4","Roland Jungnickel","37601356600","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601356700","5","Christian Rohrdantz","37601356700","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601355400","6","Juergen Schniertshauer","37601355400","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601354600","7","David Spretke","37601354600","IBM Haifa Research Lab Israel","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37392085400","8","Peter Bak","37392085400","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","25-26 Oct. 2010","Salt Lake City, UT, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2010.5653071","278","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5653071/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5649053","978-1-4244-9488-0","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9488-0","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-9487-3","10EX4986","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5653071","25-26 Oct. 2010","5638583","2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2010","IEEE","75","277","Visual analytics of a pandemic spread: VAST 2010 Mini Challenge 2 award: Thorough description of analytic process"
"Given a set of hospital admittance and death records, the challenge was to characterize the spread of a pandemic in terms of the attack and mortality rates, spatiotemporal patterns of onset and the recovery time. We began the analysis by preprocessing the hospital admittance records using the University of Pittsburgh's CoCo classifier. CoCo is a text classification software that takes hospital admittance fields and classifies them into chief complaint categories (Botulinic, Constitutional, Gastrointestinal, Hemorrhagic, Neurological, Rash, Respiratory, and Other). The choice of the CoCo classifier was based on its online availability as well as its well documented classification performance metrics, see. Once the data was classified, we utilized and extended work done by the Purdue University Visual Analytics Center on healthcare analysis. Our system consists of a combination of linked views, showing time series views of syndromes and death rates through line graph views (Figure 1 - Top), stacked graph views showing deaths (Figure 1 - Bottom), geographical map views showing the impact by country (not illustrated in this paper), and summary windows providing statistical breakdowns of the data (not illustrated in this paper). All views are linked through an interactive time slider that allows users to explore the data over time. Extensions to our previous work include the stacked graph view, summary windows, new control chart methods, and an interactive `tape measure' tool.","","EPHEMERA","5652661","Purdue Visual Analytics Center - Purdue University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37397435000","1","Abish Malik","37397435000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Purdue Visual Analytics Center - Purdue University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601862300","2","Shehzad Afzal","37601862300","University of Houston - Downtown","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37845855700","3","Erin Hodgess","37845855700","Purdue Visual Analytics Center - Purdue University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282598900","4","David S.

"In the 2005 publication ""Illuminating the Path"" visual analytics was defined as ""the science of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual interfaces."" A lot of work has been done in visual analytics over the intervening five years. While visual analytics started in the United States with a focus on security, it is now a worldwide research agenda with a broad range of application domains. This is evidenced by efforts like the European VisMaster program and the upcoming Visual Analytics and Knowledge Discovery (VAKD) workshop, just to name two.There are still questions concerning where and how visual analytics fits in the large body of research and applications represented by the VisWeek community. This panel will present distinct viewpoints on what visual analytics is and its role in understanding complex information in a complex world. The goal of this panel is to engender discussion from the audience on the emergence and continued advancement of visual analytics and its role relative to fields of related research. Four distinguished panelists will provide their perspective on visual analytics focusing on what it is, what it should be, and thoughts about a development path between these two states. The purpose of the presentations is not to give a critical review of the literature but rather to give a review on the field and to provide a contextual perspective based on the panelists' years of experience and accumulated knowledge.","","EPHEMERA","5649078","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","","1","Richard May","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Stanford University","","2","Pat Hanrahan","","University of Konstanz","","3","Daniel A.
