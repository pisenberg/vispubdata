"Integral surfaces are ideal tools to illustrate vector fields and fluid flow structures. However, these surfaces can be visually complex and exhibit difficult geometric properties, owing to strong stretching, shearing and folding of the flow from which they are derived. Many techniques for non-photorealistic rendering have been presented previously. It is, however, unclear how these techniques can be applied to integral surfaces. In this paper, we examine how transparency and texturing techniques can be used with integral surfaces to convey both shape and directional information. We present a rendering pipeline that combines these techniques aimed at faithfully and accurately representing integral surfaces while improving visualization insight. The presented pipeline is implemented directly on the GPU, providing real-time interaction for all rendering modes, and does not require expensive preprocessing of integral surfaces after computation.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613472/","LOCKED","5613472","University of Kaiserslautern","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37587428300","1","Mathias Hummel","37587428300","University of California, Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282573700","2","Christoph Garth","37282573700","University of California, Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282068700","3","Bernd Hamann","37282068700","University of Kaiserslautern","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282578800","4","Hans Hagen","37282578800","University of California, Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267811400","5","Kenneth I.

"Shading is an important feature for the comprehension of volume datasets, but is difficult to implement accurately. Current techniques based on pre-integrated direct volume rendering approximate the volume rendering integral by ignoring non-linear gradient variations between front and back samples, which might result in cumulated shading errors when gradient variations are important and / or when the illumination function features high frequencies. In this paper, we explore a simple approach for pre-integrated volume rendering with non-linear gradient interpolation between front and back samples. We consider that the gradient smoothly varies along a quadratic curve instead of a segment in-between consecutive samples. This not only allows us to compute more accurate shaded pre-integrated look-up tables, but also allows us to more efficiently process shading amplifying effects, based on gradient filtering. An interesting property is that the pre-integration tables we use remain two-dimensional as for usual pre-integrated classification. We conduct experiments using a full hardware approach with the Blinn-Phong illumination model as well as with a non-photorealistic illumination model.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613490/","LOCKED","5613490","University of Strasbourg","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590980200","1","Amel Guetat","37590980200","University of Strasbourg","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590983400","2","Alexandre Ancel","37590983400","UC Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284319100","3","Stephane Marchesin","37284319100","University of Strasbourg","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284320600","4","Jean-Michel Dischler","37284320600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.187","1494","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=5613490","direct volume rendering","pre-integration","gradient interpolation","","","","","","","Interpolation","Rendering (computer graphics)","Lighting","Mathematical model","Niobium","Computational modeling","Equations","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613490","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","2","1487","Pre-Integrated Volume Rendering with Non-Linear Gradient Interpolation","16"
"A (3D) scalar grid is a regular n1 × n2 × n3 grid of vertices where each vertex v is associated with some scalar value sv. Applying trilinear interpolation, the scalar grid determines a scalar function g where g(v) = sv for each grid vertex v. An isosurface with isovalue σ is a triangular mesh which approximates the level set g-1 (σ). The fractal dimension of an isosurface represents the growth in the isosurface as the number of grid cubes increases. We define and discuss the fractal isosurface dimension. Plotting the fractal dimension as a function of the isovalues in a data set provides information about the isosurfaces determined by the data set. We present statistics on the average fractal dimension of 60 publicly available benchmark data sets. We also show the fractal dimension is highly correlated with topological noise in the benchmark data sets, measuring the topological noise by the number of connected components in the isosurface. Lastly, we present a formula predicting the fractal dimension as a function of noise and validate the formula with experimental results.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613459/","LOCKED","5613459","Computer and Information Science Department at The Ohio State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604590700","1","Marc Khoury","37604590700","Computer and Information Science Department at The Ohio State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284274100","2","Rephael Wenger","37284274100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.182","1205","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613459/","Isosurfaces","scalar data","fractal dimension","","","","","","","Fractals","Isosurfaces","Noise","Noise measurement","Benchmark testing","Correlation","Area measurement","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613459","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","3","1198","On the Fractal Dimension of Isosurfaces","16"
"Electronic test and measurement systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated in order to match the increased complexity and ultra-high speed of the devices under test. A key feature in many such instruments is a vastly increased capacity for storage of digital signals. Storage of 109 time points or more is now possible. At the same time, the typical screens on such measurement devices are relatively small. Therefore, these instruments can only render an extremely small fraction of the complete signal at any time. SignalLens uses a Focus+Context approach to provide a means of navigating to and inspecting low-level signal details in the context of the entire signal trace. This approach provides a compact visualization suitable for embedding into the small displays typically provided by electronic measurement instruments. We further augment this display with computed tracks which display time-aligned computed properties of the signal. By combining and filtering these computed tracks it is possible to easily and quickly find computationally detected features in the data which are often obscured by the visual compression required to render the large data sets on a small screen. Further, these tracks can be viewed in the context of the entire signal trace as well as visible high-level signal features. Several examples using real-world electronic measurement data are presented, which demonstrate typical use cases and the effectiveness of the design.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613426/","LOCKED","5613426","Agilent Laboratories","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37587984100","1","Robert Kincaid","37587984100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","36","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.193","907","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613426/","Focus+Context","Lens","Test and Measurement","Electronic Signal","Signal Processing","","","","","Lenses","Context","Time series analysis","Navigation","Visualization","Instruments","Data visualization","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613426","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","4","900","SignalLens: Focus+Context Applied to Electronic Time Series","16"
"An important goal of scientific data analysis is to understand the behavior of a system or process based on a sample of the system. In many instances it is possible to observe both input parameters and system outputs, and characterize the system as a high-dimensional function. Such data sets arise, for instance, in large numerical simulations, as energy landscapes in optimization problems, or in the analysis of image data relating to biological or medical parameters. This paper proposes an approach to analyze and visualizing such data sets. The proposed method combines topological and geometric techniques to provide interactive visualizations of discretely sampled high-dimensional scalar fields. The method relies on a segmentation of the parameter space using an approximate Morse-Smale complex on the cloud of point samples. For each crystal of the Morse-Smale complex, a regression of the system parameters with respect to the output yields a curve in the parameter space. The result is a simplified geometric representation of the Morse-Smale complex in the high dimensional input domain. Finally, the geometric representation is embedded in 2D, using dimension reduction, to provide a visualization platform. The geometric properties of the regression curves enable the visualization of additional information about each crystal such as local and global shape, width, length, and sampling densities. The method is illustrated on several synthetic examples of two dimensional functions. Two use cases, using data sets from the UCI machine learning repository, demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach on real data. Finally, in collaboration with domain experts the proposed method is applied to two scientific challenges. The analysis of parameters of climate simulations and their relationship to predicted global energy flux and the concentrations of chemical species in a combustion simulation and their integration with temperature.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613467/","LOCKED","5613467","University of Utah","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37390992900","1","Samuel Gerber","37390992900","Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564112000","2","Peer-Timo Bremer","37564112000","University of Utah","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284312600","3","Valerio Pascucci","37284312600","University of Utah","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267322600","4","Ross Whitaker","37267322600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","48","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.213","1280","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613467/","Morse theory","High-dimensional visualization","Morse-Smale complex","","","","","","","Crystals","Manifolds","Approximation methods","Data visualization","Kernel","Geometry","Concrete","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613467","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","5","1271","Visual Exploration of High Dimensional Scalar Functions","16"
"In this paper, we introduce a novel application of volume modeling techniques on laser Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) therapy simulation. The core technique in our system is an algorithm for simulating the tissue vaporization process by laser heating. Different from classical volume CSG operations, our technique takes experimental data as the guidance to determine the vaporization amount so that only a specified amount of tissue is vaporized in each time. Our algorithm uses a predictor-corrector strategy. First, we apply the classical CSG algorithm on a tetrahedral grid based distance field to estimate the vaporized tissue amount. Then, a volume-correction phase is applied on the distance field. To improve the performance, we further propose optimization approaches for efficient implementation.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613481/","LOCKED","5613481","University of Minnesota","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273740800","1","Nan Zhang","37273740800","University of Minnesota","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37599791400","2","Xiangmin Zhou","37599791400","University of Minnesota","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592889500","3","Yunhe Shen","37592889500","University of Minnesota","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37587454000","4","Robert Sweet","37587454000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.221","1412","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613481/","Volume modeling","volume CSG","controlled-volume vaporization","medical simulation","laser BPH simulator","","","","","Laser modes","Laser beams","Laser ablation","Computational modeling","Solid modeling","Surface emitting lasers","Surgery","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613481","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","6","1405","Volumetric Modeling in Laser BPH Therapy Simulation","16"
"High quality volume rendering of SPH data requires a complex order-dependent resampling of particle quantities along the view rays. In this paper we present an efficient approach to perform this task using a novel view-space discretization of the simulation domain. Our method draws upon recent work on GPU-based particle voxelization for the efficient resampling of particles into uniform grids. We propose a new technique that leverages a perspective grid to adaptively discretize the view-volume, giving rise to a continuous level-of-detail sampling structure and reducing memory requirements compared to a uniform grid. In combination with a level-of-detail representation of the particle set, the perspective grid allows effectively reducing the amount of primitives to be processed at run-time. We demonstrate the quality and performance of our method for the rendering of fluid and gas dynamics SPH simulations consisting of many millions of particles.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613495/","LOCKED","5613495","Technische Universität München","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590979700","1","Roland Fraedrich","37590979700","Technische Universität München","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37411079300","2","Stefan Auer","37411079300","Technische Universität München","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37444424000","3","Rudiger Westermann","37444424000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","39","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.148","1540","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613495/","Particle visualization","volume rendering","ray-casting","GPU resampling","","","","","","Rendering (computer graphics)","Graphics processing unit","Three dimensional displays","Interpolation","Adaptation model","Slabs","Kernel","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613495","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","7","1533","Efficient High-Quality Volume Rendering of SPH Data","16"
"Among the multifarious tag-clouding techniques, Wordle stands out to the community by providing an aesthetic layout, eliciting the emergence of the participatory culture and usage of tag-clouding in the artistic creations. In this paper, we introduce ManiWordle, a Wordle-based visualization tool that revamps interactions with the layout by supporting custom manipulations. ManiWordle allows people to manipulate typography, color, and composition not only for the layout as a whole, but also for the individual words, enabling them to have better control over the layout result. We first describe our design rationale along with the interaction techniques for tweaking the layout. We then present the results both from the preliminary usability study and from the comparative study between ManiWordle and Wordle. The results suggest that ManiWordle provides higher user satisfaction and an efficient method of creating the desired ""art work,"" harnessing the power behind the ever-increasing popularity of Wordle.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613458/","LOCKED","5613458","Seoul National University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37587908000","1","Kyle Koh","37587908000","Microsoft Research","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37293389400","2","Bongshin Lee","37293389400","Seoul National University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37594632900","3","Bohyoung Kim","37594632900","Seoul National University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37422552700","4","Jinwook Seo","37422552700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","63","3","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.175","1197","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613458/","Interaction design","direct manipulation","flexibilty-usability tradeoff","tag-cloud","participatory visualization","user study.","","","","Layout","Tag clouds","Visualization","Color","Instruction sets","Spirals","Usability","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613458","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","8","1190","ManiWordle: Providing Flexible Control over Wordle","16"
"Characteristic curves of vector fields include stream, path, and streak lines. Stream and path lines can be obtained by a simple vector field integration of an autonomous ODE system, i.e., they can be described as tangent curves of a vector field. This facilitates their mathematical analysis including the extraction of core lines around which stream or path lines exhibit swirling motion, or the computation of their curvature for every point in the domain without actually integrating them. Such a description of streak lines is not yet available, which excludes them from most of the feature extraction and analysis tools that have been developed in our community. In this paper, we develop the first description of streak lines as tangent curves of a derived vector field - the streak line vector field - and show how it can be computed from the spatial and temporal gradients of the flow map, i.e., a dense path line integration is required. We demonstrate the high accuracy of our approach by comparing it to solutions where the ground truth is analytically known and to solutions where the ground truth has been obtained using the classic streak line computation. Furthermore, we apply a number of feature extraction and analysis tools to the new streak line vector field including the extraction of cores of swirling streak lines and the computation of streak line curvature fields. These first applications foreshadow the large variety of possible future research directions based on our new mathematical description of streak lines.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613462/","LOCKED","5613462","New York University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282635100","1","Tino Weinkauf","37282635100","University of Magdeburg","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266875400","2","Holger Theisel","37266875400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","43","2","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.198","1234","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613462/","unsteady flow visualization","streak lines","streak surfaces","feature extraction","","","","","","Visualization","Feature extraction","Accuracy","Three dimensional displays","Vectors","Spatial resolution","Complexity theory","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613462","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","9","1225","Streak Lines as Tangent Curves of a Derived Vector Field","16"
"Interactivity is key to exploration of volume data. Interactivity may be hindered due to many factors, e.g. large data size,high resolution or complexity of a data set, or an expensive rendering algorithm. We present a novel framework for visualizing volumedata that enables interactive exploration using proxy images, without accessing the original 3D data. Data exploration using directvolume rendering requires multiple (often redundant) accesses to possibly large amounts of data. The notion of visualization by proxyrelies on the ability to defer operations traditionally used for exploring 3D data to a more suitable intermediate representation forinteraction - proxy images. Such operations include view changes, transfer function exploration, and relighting. While previous workhas addressed specific interaction needs, we provide a complete solution that enables real-time interaction with large data sets andhas low hardware and storage requirements.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613497/","LOCKED","5613497","Univ. of California, Davis, CA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37404049100","1","Anna Tikhonova","37404049100","Univ. of California, Davis, CA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282925900","2","Carlos D.

"This design paper presents new guidance for creating map legends in a dynamic environment. Our contribution is a set ofguidelines for legend design in a visualization context and a series of illustrative themes through which they may be expressed. Theseare demonstrated in an applications context through interactive software prototypes. The guidelines are derived from cartographicliterature and in liaison with EDINA who provide digital mapping services for UK tertiary education. They enhance approaches tolegend design that have evolved for static media with visualization by considering: selection, layout, symbols, position, dynamismand design and process. Broad visualization legend themes include: The Ground Truth Legend, The Legend as Statistical Graphicand The Map is the Legend. Together, these concepts enable us to augment legends with dynamic properties that address specificneeds, rethink their nature and role and contribute to a wider re-evaluation of maps as artifacts of usage rather than statements offact. EDINA has acquired funding to enhance their clients with visualization legends that use these concepts as a consequence ofthis work. The guidance applies to the design of a wide range of legends and keys used in cartography and information visualization.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613425/","LOCKED","5613425","Dept. of Inf.

"This paper introduces a new streamline placement and selection algorithm for 3D vector fields. Instead of considering the problem as a simple feature search in data space, we base our work on the observation that most streamline fields generate a lot of self-occlusion which prevents proper visualization. In order to avoid this issue, we approach the problem in a view-dependent fashion and dynamically determine a set of streamlines which contributes to data understanding without cluttering the view. Since our technique couples flow characteristic criteria and view-dependent streamline selection we are able achieve the best of both worlds: relevant flow description and intelligible, uncluttered pictures. We detail an efficient GPU implementation of our algorithm, show comprehensive visual results on multiple datasets and compare our method with existing flow depiction techniques. Our results show that our technique greatly improves the readability of streamline visualizations on different datasets without requiring user intervention.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613500/","LOCKED","5613500","UC Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284319100","1","Stephane Marchesin","37284319100","UC Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406743400","2","Cheng-Kai Chen","37406743400","UC Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37599717800","3","Chris Ho","37599717800","UC Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275869400","4","Kwan-Liu Ma","37275869400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","46","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.212","1586","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613500/","Streamlines","Vector fields","View-dependent.","","","","","","","Three dimensional displays","Streaming media","Entropy","Measurement","Visualization","Rendering (computer graphics)","","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613500","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","12","1578","View-Dependent Streamlines for 3D Vector Fields","16"
"Special relativistic visualization offers the possibility of experiencing the optical effects of traveling near the speed of light, including apparent geometric distortions as well as Doppler and searchlight effects. Early high-quality computer graphics images of relativistic scenes were created using offline, computationally expensive CPU-side 4D ray tracing. Alternate approaches such as image-based rendering and polygon-distortion methods are able to achieve interactivity, but exhibit inferior visual quality due to sampling artifacts. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid rendering technique based on polygon distortion and local ray tracing that facilitates interactive high-quality visualization of multiple objects moving at relativistic speeds in arbitrary directions. The method starts by calculating tight image-space footprints for the apparent triangles of the 3D scene objects. The final image is generated using a single image-space ray tracing step incorporating Doppler and searchlight effects. Our implementation uses GPU shader programming and hardware texture filtering to achieve high rendering speed.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613464/","LOCKED","5613464","VISUS","","1","Thomas Müller","","VISUS","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086989668","2","Sebastian Grottel","37086989668","VISUS","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268045000","3","Daniel Weiskopf","37268045000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.196","1250","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613464/","Poincare transformation","aberration of light","Doppler effect","illumination","searchlight effect","special relativity","GPU ray tracing","","","Ray tracing","Observers","Geometry","Visualization","Rendering (computer graphics)","Doppler effect","Color","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613464","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","13","1243","Special Relativistic Visualization by Local Ray Tracing","16"
"Streak surfaces are among the most important features to support 3D unsteady flow exploration, but they are also among the computationally most demanding. Furthermore, to enable a feature driven analysis of the flow, one is mainly interested in streak surfaces that show separation profiles and thus detect unstable manifolds in the flow. The computation of such separation surfaces requires to place seeding structures at the separation locations and to let the structures move correspondingly to these locations in the unsteady flow. Since only little knowledge exists about the time evolution of separating streak surfaces, at this time, an automated exploration of 3D unsteady flows using such surfaces is not feasible. Therefore, in this paper we present an interactive approach for the visual analysis of separating streak surfaces. Our method draws upon recent work on the extraction of Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) and the real-time visualization of streak surfaces on the GPU. We propose an interactive technique for computing ridges in the finite time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) field at each time step, and we use these ridges as seeding structures to track streak surfaces in the time-varying flow. By showing separation surfaces in combination with particle trajectories, and by letting the user interactively change seeding parameters such as particle density and position, visually guided exploration of separation profiles in 3D is provided. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the reconstruction and display of semantic separable surfaces in 3D unsteady flows can be performed interactively, giving rise to new possibilities for gaining insight into complex flow phenomena.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613499/","LOCKED","5613499","Technische Universität München","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606419000","1","Florian Ferstl","37606419000","Technische Universität München","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37587634700","2","Kai Burger","37587634700","University of Magdeburg","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266875400","3","Holger Theisel","37266875400","Technische Universität München","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37444424000","4","Rudiger Westermann","37444424000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","14","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.169","1577","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613499/","Unsteady flow visualization","feature extraction","streak surface generation","GPUs","","","","","","Three dimensional displays","Pixel","Graphics processing unit","Skeleton","Feature extraction","Surface reconstruction","","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613499","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","14","1569","Interactive Separating Streak Surfaces","16"
"Cells in an organism share the same genetic information in their DNA, but have very different forms and behavior because of the selective expression of subsets of their genes. The widely used approach of measuring gene expression over time from a tissue sample using techniques such as microarrays or sequencing do not provide information about the spatial position with in the tissue where these genes are expressed. In contrast, we are working with biologists who use techniques that measure gene expression in every individual cell of entire fruitfly embryos over an hour of their development, and do so for multiple closely-related subspecies of Drosophila. These scientists are faced with the challenge of integrating temporal gene expression data with the spatial location of cells and, moreover, comparing this data across multiple related species. We have worked with these biologists over the past two years to develop MulteeSum, a visualization system that supports inspection and curation of data sets showing gene expression over time, in conjunction with the spatial location of the cells where the genes are expressed - it is the first tool to support comparisons across multiple such data sets. MulteeSum is part of a general and flexible framework we developed with our collaborators that is built around multiple summaries for each cell, allowing the biologists to explore the results of computations that mix spatial information, gene expression measurements over time, and data from multiple related species or organisms. We justify our design decisions based on specific descriptions of the analysis needs of our collaborators, and provide anecdotal evidence of the efficacy of MulteeSum through a series of case studies.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613427/","LOCKED","5613427","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564728700","1","Miriah Meyer","37564728700","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349490300","2","Tamara Munzner","37349490300","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590943800","3","Angela DePace","37590943800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275698100","4","Hanspeter Pfister","37275698100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","33","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.137","917","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613427/","spatial data","temporal data","gene expression","","","","","","","Embryo","Gene expression","Cells (biology)","Data visualization","Image color analysis","Rendering (computer graphics)","","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613427","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","15","908","MulteeSum: A Tool for Comparative Spatial and Temporal Gene Expression Data","16"
"It remains challenging for information visualization novices to rapidly construct visualizations during exploratory data analysis. We conducted an exploratory laboratory study in which information visualization novices explored fictitious sales data by communicating visualization specifications to a human mediator, who rapidly constructed the visualizations using commercial visualization software. We found that three activities were central to the iterative visualization construction process: data attribute selection, visual template selection, and visual mapping specification. The major barriers faced by the participants were translating questions into data attributes, designing visual mappings, and interpreting the visualizations. Partial specification was common, and the participants used simple heuristics and preferred visualizations they were already familiar with, such as bar, line and pie charts. We derived abstract models from our observations that describe barriers in the data exploration process and uncovered how information visualization novices think about visualization specifications. Our findings support the need for tools that suggest potential visualizations and support iterative refinement, that provide explanations and help with learning, and that are tightly integrated into tool support for the overall visual analytics process.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613431/","LOCKED","5613431","University of Victoria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37322138200","1","Lars Grammel","37322138200","University of Victoria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275861300","2","Melanie Tory","37275861300","University of Victoria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268043300","3","Margaret-Anne Storey","37268043300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","80","3","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.164","952","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613431/","Empirical study","visualization","visualization construction","visual analytics","visual mapping","novices","","","","Decision support systems","Visualization","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613431","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","16","943","How Information Visualization Novices Construct Visualizations","16"
"Symmetric second-order tensor fields play a central role in scientific and biomedical studies as well as in image analysis and feature-extraction methods. The utility of displaying tensor field samples has driven the development of visualization techniques that encode the tensor shape and orientation into the geometry of a tensor glyph. With some exceptions, these methods work only for positive-definite tensors (i.e. having positive eigenvalues, such as diffusion tensors). We expand the scope of tensor glyphs to all symmetric second-order tensors in two and three dimensions, gracefully and unambiguously depicting any combination of positive and negative eigenvalues. We generalize a previous method of superquadric glyphs for positive-definite tensors by drawing upon a larger portion of the superquadric shape space, supplemented with a coloring that indicates the tensor's quadratic form. We show that encoding arbitrary eigenvalue sign combinations requires design choices that differ fundamentally from those in previous work on traceless tensors (arising in the study of liquid crystals). Our method starts with a design of 2-D tensor glyphs guided by principles of symmetry and continuity, and creates 3-D glyphs that include the 2-D glyphs in their axis-aligned cross-sections. A key ingredient of our method is a novel way of mapping from the shape space of three-dimensional symmetric second-order tensors to the unit square. We apply our new glyphs to stress tensors from mechanics, geometry tensors and Hessians from image analysis, and rate-of-deformation tensors in computational fluid dynamics.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613502/","LOCKED","5613502","Computer Science Department and the Computation Institute, University of Chicago","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606352800","1","Thomas Schultz","37606352800","Computer Science Department and the Computation Institute, University of Chicago","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282742400","2","Gordon L.

"Conventional browsing of image collections use mechanisms such as thumbnails arranged on a regular grid or on a line, often mounted over a scrollable panel. However, this approach does not scale well with the size of the datasets (number of images). In this paper, we propose a new thumbnail-based interface to browse large collections of images. Our approach is based on weighted centroidal anisotropic Voronoi diagrams. A dynamically changing subset of images is represented by thumbnails and shown on the screen. Thumbnails are shaped like general polygons, to better cover screen space, while still reflecting the original aspect ratios or orientation of the represented images. During the browsing process, thumbnails are dynamically rearranged, reshaped and rescaled. The objective is to devote more screen space (more numerous and larger thumbnails) to the parts of the dataset closer to the current region of interest, and progressively lesser away from it, while still making the dataset visible as a whole. During the entire process, temporal coherence is always maintained. GPU implementation easily guarantees the frame rates needed for fully smooth interactivity.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613466/","LOCKED","5613466","Univ. of Insubria, Varese, Italy","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586785100","1","Paolo Brivio","37586785100","Univ. of Insubria, Varese, Italy","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591264000","2","Marco Tarini","37591264000","ISTI, CNR, Pisa, Italy","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37265783400","3","Paolo Cignoni","37265783400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","20","2","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.136","1270","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613466/","visualization System and Toolkit Design","Scalability Issues","User Interfaces","Zooming and Navigation Techniques","","","","","","Shape","Calibration","Navigation","Browsers","Coherence","Three dimensional displays","Visualization","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613466","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","18","1261","Browsing Large Image Datasets through Voronoi Diagrams","16"
"In many applications of Direct Volume Rendering (DVR) the importance of a certain material or feature is highly dependent on its relative spatial location. For instance, in the medical diagnostic procedure, the patient's symptoms often lead to specification of features, tissues and organs of particular interest. One such example is pockets of gas which, if found inside the body at abnormal locations, are a crucial part of a diagnostic visualization. This paper presents an approach that enhances DVR transfer function design with spatial localization based on user specified material dependencies. Semantic expressions are used to define conditions based on relations between different materials, such as only render iodine uptake when close to liver. The underlying methods rely on estimations of material distributions which are acquired by weighing local neighborhoods of the data against approximations of material likelihood functions. This information is encoded and used to influence rendering according to the user's specifications. The result is improved focus on important features by allowing the user to suppress spatially less-important data. In line with requirements from actual clinical DVR practice, the methods do not require explicit material segmentation that would be impossible or prohibitively time-consuming to achieve in most real cases. The scheme scales well to higher dimensions which accounts for multi-dimensional transfer functions and multivariate data. Dual-Energy Computed Tomography, an important new modality in radiology, is used to demonstrate this scalability. In several examples we show significantly improved focus on clinically important aspects in the rendered images.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613470/","LOCKED","5613470","C-Research - Linköping University, Sweden and Siemens Corporate Research, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591265100","1","Stefan Lindholm","37591265100","Siemens Corporate Research, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284208400","2","Patric Ljung","37284208400","Sectra Imtec AB, Sweden","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284209100","3","Claes Lundström","37284209100","CMIV - Link öping University - Linköping University Hospital, Sweden","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604521200","4","Anders Persson","37604521200","C-Research - Linköping University, Sweden","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284192000","5","Anders Ynnerman","37284192000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","13","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.195","1310","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613470/","Direct Volume Rendering","Transfer Function","Spatial Conditioning","Neighborhood Meta-Data.","","","","","","Materials","Histograms","Rendering (computer graphics)","Blood","Semantics","Transfer functions","Probes","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613470","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","19","1301","Spatial Conditioning of Transfer Functions Using Local Material Distributions","16"
"Line graphs have been the visualization of choice for temporal data ever since the days of William Playfair (1759-1823), but realistic temporal analysis tasks often include multiple simultaneous time series. In this work, we explore user performance for comparison, slope, and discrimination tasks for different line graph techniques involving multiple time series. Our results show that techniques that create separate charts for each time series--such as small multiples and horizon graphs--are generally more efficient for comparisons across time series with a large visual span. On the other hand, shared-space techniques--like standard line graphs--are typically more efficient for comparisons over smaller visual spans where the impact of overlap and clutter is reduced.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613429/","LOCKED","5613429","Purdue University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399152800","1","Waqas Javed","37399152800","Purdue University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590945700","2","Bryan McDonnel","37590945700","Purdue University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295438200","3","Niklas Elmqvist","37295438200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","105","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.162","934","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613429/","line graphs","braided graphs","horizon graphs","small multiples","stacked graphs","evaluation","design guidelines","","","Time series analysis","Visualization","Data visualization","Clutter","Pixel","Image color analysis","Training","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613429","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","20","927","Graphical Perception of Multiple Time Series","16"
"Pixel-based visualization is a popular method of conveying large amounts of numerical data graphically. Application scenarios include business and finance, bioinformatics and remote sensing. In this work, we examined how the usability of such visual representations varied across different tasks and block resolutions. The main stimuli consisted of temporal pixel-based visualization with a white-red color map, simulating monthly temperature variation over a six-year period. In the first study, we included 5 separate tasks to exert different perceptual loads. We found that performance varied considerably as a function of task, ranging from 75% correct in low-load tasks to below 40% in high-load tasks. There was a small but consistent effect of resolution, with the uniform patch improving performance by around 6% relative to higher block resolution. In the second user study, we focused on a high-load task for evaluating month-to-month changes across different regions of the temperature range. We tested both CIE L*u*v* and RGB color spaces. We found that the nature of the change-evaluation errors related directly to the distance between the compared regions in the mapped color space. We were able to reduce such errors by using multiple color bands for the same data range. In a final study, we examined more fully the influence of block resolution on performance, and found block resolution had a limited impact on the effectiveness of pixel-based visualization.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613433/","LOCKED","5613433","Swansea University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591074800","1","Rita Borgo","37591074800","Swansea University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591072200","2","Karl Proctor","37591072200","Swansea University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37280982800","3","Min Chen","37280982800","Heidelberg University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37393638200","4","Heike Jänicke","37393638200","Swansea University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274098800","5","Tavi Murray","37274098800","Swansea University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591073500","6","Ian Thornton","37591073500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","14","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.150","972","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613433/","Pixel-based visualization","evaluation","user study","visual search","change detection.","","","","","Pixel","Image color analysis","Data visualization","Accuracy","Visualization","Image resolution","Time series analysis","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613433","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","21","963","Evaluating the impact of task demands and block resolution on the effectiveness of pixel-based visualization","16"
"We present the design and evaluation of FI3D, a direct-touch data exploration technique for 3D visualization spaces. The exploration of three-dimensional data is core to many tasks and domains involving scientific visualizations. Thus, effective data navigation techniques are essential to enable comprehension, understanding, and analysis of the information space. While evidence exists that touch can provide higher-bandwidth input, somesthetic information that is valuable when interacting with virtual worlds, and awareness when working in collaboration, scientific data exploration in 3D poses unique challenges to the development of effective data manipulations. We present a technique that provides touch interaction with 3D scientific data spaces in 7 DOF. This interaction does not require the presence of dedicated objects to constrain the mapping, a design decision important for many scientific datasets such as particle simulations in astronomy or physics. We report on an evaluation that compares the technique to conventional mouse-based interaction. Our results show that touch interaction is competitive in interaction speed for translation and integrated interaction, is easy to learn and use, and is preferred for exploration and wayfinding tasks. To further explore the applicability of our basic technique for other types of scientific visualizations we present a second case study, adjusting the interaction to the illustrative visualization of fiber tracts of the brain and the manipulation of cutting planes in this context.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613504/","LOCKED","5613504","University of Groningen","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593898200","1","Lingyun Yu","37593898200","University of Groningen","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591151000","2","Pjotr Svetachov","37591151000","INRIA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591317800","3","Petra Isenberg","37591317800","University of Groningen","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591149600","4","Maarten H.

"Most multidimensional projection techniques rely on distance (dissimilarity) information between data instances to embed high-dimensional data into a visual space. When data are endowed with Cartesian coordinates, an extra computational effort is necessary to compute the needed distances, making multidimensional projection prohibitive in applications dealing with interactivity and massive data. The novel multidimensional projection technique proposed in this work, called Part-Linear Multidimensional Projection (PLMP), has been tailored to handle multivariate data represented in Cartesian high-dimensional spaces, requiring only distance information between pairs of representative samples. This characteristic renders PLMP faster than previous methods when processing large data sets while still being competitive in terms of precision. Moreover, knowing the range of variation for data instances in the high-dimensional space, we can make PLMP a truly streaming data projection technique, a trait absent in previous methods.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613468/","LOCKED","5613468","Universidade de São Paulo (USP)","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590969400","1","Fernando V.

"Conveying data uncertainty in visualizations is crucial for preventing viewers from drawing conclusions based on untrustworthy data points. This paper proposes a methodology for efficiently generating density plots of uncertain multivariate data sets that draws viewers to preattentively identify values of high certainty while not calling attention to uncertain values. We demonstrate how to augment scatter plots and parallel coordinates plots to incorporate statistically modeled uncertainty and show how to integrate them with existing multivariate analysis techniques, including outlier detection and interactive brushing. Computing high quality density plots can be expensive for large data sets, so we also describe a probabilistic plotting technique that summarizes the data without requiring explicit density plot computation. These techniques have been useful for identifying brain tumors in multivariate magnetic resonance spectroscopy data and we describe how to extend them to visualize ensemble data sets.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613435/","LOCKED","5613435","UNC Chapel Hill","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593630400","1","David Feng","37593630400","UNC Chapel Hill","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590983500","2","Lester Kwock","37590983500","UNC Chapel Hill","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37600714800","3","Yueh Lee","37600714800","UNC Chapel Hill","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38183525100","4","Russell Taylor","38183525100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","39","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.176","989","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613435/","Uncertainty visualization","brushing","scatter plots","parallel coordinates","multivariate data","","","","","Data visualization","Uncertainty","Gaussian distribution","Visualization","Correlation","Spectroscopy","","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613435","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","24","980","Matching Visual Saliency to Confidence in Plots of Uncertain Data","16"
"Many visualization applications benefit from displaying content on real-world objects rather than on a traditional display (e.g., a monitor). This type of visualization display is achieved by projecting precisely controlled illumination from multiple projectors onto the real-world colored objects. For such a task, the placement of the projectors is critical in assuring that the desired visualization is possible. Using ad hoc projector placement may cause some appearances to suffer from color shifting due to insufficient projector light radiance being exposed onto the physical surface. This leads to an incorrect appearance and ultimately to a false and potentially misleading visualization. In this paper, we present a framework to discover the optimal position and orientation of the projectors for such projection-based visualization displays. An optimal projector placement should be able to achieve the desired visualization with minimal projector light radiance. When determining optimal projector placement, object visibility, surface reflectance properties, and projector-surface distance and orientation need to be considered. We first formalize a theory for appearance editing image formation and construct a constrained linear system of equations that express when a desired novel appearance or visualization is possible given a geometric and surface reflectance model of the physical surface. Then, we show how to apply this constrained system in an adaptive search to efficiently discover the optimal projector placement which achieves the desired appearance. Constraints can be imposed on the maximum radiance allowed by the projectors and the projectors' placement to support specific goals of various visualization applications. We perform several real-world and simulated appearance edits and visualizations to demonstrate the improvement obtained by our discovered projector placement over ad hoc projector placement.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613506/","LOCKED","5613506","Dept. of Comput.

"Insight into the dynamics of blood-flow considerably improves the understanding of the complex cardiovascular system and its pathologies. Advances in MRI technology enable acquisition of 4D blood-flow data, providing quantitative blood-flow velocities over time. The currently typical slice-by-slice analysis requires a full mental reconstruction of the unsteady blood-flow field, which is a tedious and highly challenging task, even for skilled physicians. We endeavor to alleviate this task by means of comprehensive visualization and interaction techniques. In this paper we present a framework for pre-clinical cardiovascular research, providing tools to both interactively explore the 4D blood-flow data and depict the essential blood-flow characteristics. The framework encompasses a variety of visualization styles, comprising illustrative techniques as well as improved methods from the established field of flow visualization. Each of the incorporated styles, including exploded planar reformats, flow-direction highlights, and arrow-trails, locally captures the blood-flow dynamics and may be initiated by an interactively probed vessel cross-section. Additionally, we present the results of an evaluation with domain experts, measuring the value of each of the visualization styles and related rendering parameters.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613474/","LOCKED","5613474","Eindhoven University of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37390973400","1","Roy van Pelt","37390973400","Philips Healthcare","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591606800","2","Javier Oliván Bescós","37591606800","Philips Healthcare","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37374875300","3","Marcel Breeuwer","37374875300","King's College London; Guy's and St Thomas' NHS foundation","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37603313200","4","Rachel E.

"Although previous research has suggested that examining the interplay between internal and external representations can benefit our understanding of the role of information visualization (InfoVis) in human cognitive activities, there has been little work detailing the nature of internal representations, the relationship between internal and external representations and how interaction is related to these representations. In this paper, we identify and illustrate a specific kind of internal representation, mental models, and outline the high-level relationships between mental models and external visualizations. We present a top-down perspective of reasoning as model construction and simulation, and discuss the role of visualization in model based reasoning. From this perspective, interaction can be understood as active modeling for three primary purposes: external anchoring, information foraging, and cognitive offloading. Finally we discuss the implications of our approach for design, evaluation and theory development.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613437/","LOCKED","5613437","Georgia Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592993600","1","Zhicheng Liu","37592993600","Georgia Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267736900","2","John Stasko","37267736900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","90","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.177","1008","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613437/","mental model","model-based reasoning","distributed cognition","interaction","theory","information visualization","","","","Cognitive science","Cognition","Visualization","Data visualization","Computational modeling","Brain modeling","Humans","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613437","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","27","999","Mental Models, Visual Reasoning and Interaction in Information Visualization: A Top-down Perspective","16"
"The non-data components of a visualization, such as axes and legends, can often be just as important as the data itself. They provide contextual information essential to interpreting the data. In this paper, we describe an automated system for choosing positions and labels for axis tick marks. Our system extends Wilkinson's optimization-based labeling approach to create a more robust, full-featured axis labeler. We define an expanded space of axis labelings by automatically generating additional nice numbers as needed and by permitting the extreme labels to occur inside the data range. These changes provide flexibility in problematic cases, without degrading quality elsewhere. We also propose an additional optimization criterion, legibility, which allows us to simultaneously optimize over label formatting, font size, and orientation. To solve this revised optimization problem, we describe the optimization function and an efficient search algorithm. Finally, we compare our method to previous work using both quantitative and qualitative metrics. This paper is a good example of how ideas from automated graphic design can be applied to information visualization.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613441/","LOCKED","5613441","Stanford University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604514900","1","Justin Talbot","37604514900","Stanford University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37594968800","2","Sharon Lin","37594968800","Stanford University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349803800","3","Pat Hanrahan","37349803800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","14","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.130","1043","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613441/","axis labeling","nice numbers","","","","","","","","Labeling","Optimization","Measurement","Visualization","Search problems","Layout","","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613441","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","28","1036","An Extension of Wilkinson’s Algorithm for Positioning Tick Labels on Axes","16"
"Although direct volume rendering is established as a powerful tool for the visualization of volumetric data, efficient and reliable feature detection is still an open topic. Usually, a tradeoff between fast but imprecise classification schemes and accurate but time-consuming segmentation techniques has to be made. Furthermore, the issue of uncertainty introduced with the feature detection process is completely neglected by the majority of existing approaches.In this paper we propose a guided probabilistic volume segmentation approach that focuses on the minimization of uncertainty. In an iterative process, our system continuously assesses uncertainty of a random walker-based segmentation in order to detect regions with high ambiguity, to which the user's attention is directed to support the correction of potential misclassifications. This reduces the risk of critical segmentation errors and ensures that information about the segmentation's reliability is conveyed to the user in a dependable way. In order to improve the efficiency of the segmentation process, our technique does not only take into account the volume data to be segmented, but also enables the user to incorporate classification information. An interactive workflow has been achieved by implementing the presented system on the GPU using the OpenCL API. Our results obtained for several medical data sets of different modalities, including brain MRI and abdominal CT, demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of our approach.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613476/","LOCKED","5613476","University of Münster","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591258700","1","Jorg-Stefan Prassni","37591258700","University of Münster","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295281400","2","Timo Ropinski","37295281400","University of Münster","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267218300","3","Klaus Hinrichs","37267218300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","40","2","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.208","1365","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613476/","volume segmentation","uncertainty","classification","random walker","","","","","","Uncertainty","Image segmentation","Three dimensional displays","Probabilistic logic","Visualization","Data visualization","Transfer functions","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613476","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","29","1358","Uncertainty-Aware Guided Volume Segmentation","16"
"The analysis of multi-timepoint whole-body small animal CT data is greatly complicated by the varying posture of the subject at different timepoints. Due to these variations, correctly relating and comparing corresponding regions of interest is challenging.In addition, occlusion may prevent effective visualization of these regions of interest. To address these problems, we have developed a method that fully automatically maps the data to a standardized layout of sub-volumes, based on an articulated atlas registration.We have dubbed this process articulated planar reformation, or APR. A sub-volume can be interactively selected for closer inspection and can be compared with the corresponding sub-volume at the other timepoints, employing a number of different comparative visualization approaches. We provide an additional tool that highlights possibly interesting areas based on the change of bone density between timepoints. Furthermore we allow visualization of the local registration error, to give an indication of the accuracy of the registration. We have evaluated our approach on a case that exhibits cancer-induced bone resorption.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613480/","LOCKED","5613480","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604050900","1","Peter Kok","37604050900","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294120400","2","Martin Baiker","37294120400","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37270169100","3","Emile A.

"Interactive visualization requires the translation of data into a screen space of limited resolution. While currently ignored by most visualization models, this translation entails a loss of information and the introduction of a number of artifacts that can be useful, (e.g., aggregation, structures) or distracting (e.g., over-plotting, clutter) for the analysis. This phenomenon is observed in parallel coordinates, where overlapping lines between adjacent axes form distinct patterns, representing the relation between variables they connect. However, even for a small number of dimensions, the challenge is to effectively convey the relationships for all combinations of dimensions. The size of the dataset and a large number of dimensions only add to the complexity of this problem. To address these issues, we propose Pargnostics, parallel coordinates diagnostics, a model based on screen-space metrics that quantify the different visual structures. Pargnostics metrics are calculated for pairs of axes and take into account the resolution of the display as well as potential axis inversions. Metrics include the number of line crossings, crossing angles, convergence, overplotting, etc. To construct a visualization view, the user can pick from a ranked display showing pairs of coordinate axes and the structures between them, or examine all possible combinations of axes at once in a matrix display. Picking the best axes layout is an NP-complete problem in general, but we provide a way of automatically optimizing the display according to the user's preferences based on our metrics and model.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613439/","LOCKED","5613439","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593202500","1","Aritra Dasgupta","37593202500","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282563400","2","Robert Kosara","37282563400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","76","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.184","1026","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613439/","Parallel Coordinates","metrics","display optimization","visualization models.","","","","","","Measurement","Data visualization","Histograms","Clutter","Optimization","Visualization","Pixel","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613439","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","31","1017","Pargnostics: Screen-Space Metrics for Parallel Coordinates","16"
"Understanding the diversity of a set of multivariate objects is an important problem in many domains, including ecology, college admissions, investing, machine learning, and others. However, to date, very little work has been done to help users achieve this kind of understanding. Visual representation is especially appealing for this task because it offers the potential to allow users to efficiently observe the objects of interest in a direct and holistic way. Thus, in this paper, we attempt to formalize the problem of visualizing the diversity of a large (more than 1000 objects), multivariate (more than 5 attributes) data set as one worth deeper investigation by the information visualization community. In doing so, we contribute a precise definition of diversity, a set of requirements for diversity visualizations based on this definition, and a formal user study design intended to evaluate the capacity of a visual representation for communicating diversity information. Our primary contribution, however, is a visual representation, called the Diversity Map, for visualizing diversity. An evaluation of the Diversity Map using our study design shows that users can judge elements of diversity consistently and as or more accurately than when using the only other representation specifically designed to visualize diversity.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613443/","LOCKED","5613443","Oregon State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37589653500","1","Tuan Pham","37589653500","Oregon State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592340500","2","Rob Hess","37592340500","Oregon State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593037400","3","Crystal Ju","37593037400","Oregon State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37398562200","4","Eugene Zhang","37398562200","Oregon State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37375030300","5","Ronald Metoyer","37375030300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","17","8","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.216","1062","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613443/","information visualization","diversity","categorical data","multivariate data","evaluation","","","","","Data visualization","Visualization","Encoding","Histograms","Image color analysis","Three dimensional displays","Particle measurements","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613443","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","32","1053","Visualization of Diversity in Large Multivariate Data Sets","16"
"In this paper we present a novel anisotropic diffusion model targeted for 3D scalar field data. Our model preserves material boundaries as well as fine tubular structures while noise is smoothed out. One of the major novelties is the use of the directional second derivative to define material boundaries instead of the gradient magnitude for thresholding. This results in a diffusion model that has much lower sensitivity to the diffusion parameter and smoothes material boundaries consistently compared to gradient magnitude based techniques. We empirically analyze the stability and convergence of the proposed diffusion and demonstrate its de-noising capabilities for both analytic and real data. We also discuss applications in the context of volume rendering.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613478/","LOCKED","5613478","Simon Fraser University","","1","Zahid Hosssain","","Simon Fraser University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086891378","2","Torsten Moller","37086891378","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","13","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.147","1385","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613478/","Anisotropic diffusion","PDE","De-noising","Scale-Space","Principle Curvatures","","","","","Mathematical model","Three dimensional displays","Equations","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Noise","Noise reduction","Rendering (computer graphics)","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613478","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","33","1376","Edge Aware Anisotropic Diffusion for 3D Scalar Data","16"
"Over the past few years, large human populations around the world have been affected by an increase in significant seismic activities. For both conducting basic scientific research and for setting critical government policies, it is crucial to be able to explore and understand seismic and geographical information obtained through all scientific instruments. In this work, we present a visual analytics system that enables explorative visualization of seismic data together with satellite-based observational data, and introduce a suite of visual analytical tools. Seismic and satellite data are integrated temporally and spatially. Users can select temporal ;and spatial ranges to zoom in on specific seismic events, as well as to inspect changes both during and after the events. Tools for designing high dimensional transfer functions have been developed to enable efficient and intuitive comprehension of the multi-modal data. Spread-sheet style comparisons are used for data drill-down as well as presentation. Comparisons between distinct seismic events are also provided for characterizing event-wise differences. Our system has been designed for scalability in terms of data size, complexity (i.e. number of modalities), and varying form factors of display environments.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613482/","LOCKED","5613482","Peking University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403856700","1","Xiaoru Yuan","37403856700","Peking University","","2","He Xiao","","Peking University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37595201300","3","Hanqi Guo","37595201300","Peking University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37411096400","4","Peihong Guo","37411096400","University of Tennessee","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37585370900","5","Wesley Kendall","37585370900","University of Tennessee","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37281262900","6","Jian Huang","37281262900","China Earthquake Networks Center","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37599086100","7","Yongxian Zhang","37599086100","","","","","","","","","","","11","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.192","1420","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613482/","Earth Science Visualization","Multivariate Visualization","Seismic Data","Scalable Visualization","","","","","","Earthquakes","Data visualization","Transfer functions","Satellites","Three dimensional displays","Catalogs","Image color analysis","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613482","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","34","1413","Scalable Multi-variate Analytics of Seismic and Satellite-based Observational Data","16"

"In the development of magnetic confinement fusion which will potentially be a future source for low cost power, physicists must be able to analyze the magnetic field that confines the burning plasma. While the magnetic field can be described as a vector field, traditional techniques for analyzing the field's topology cannot be used because of its Hamiltonian nature. In this paper we describe a technique developed as a collaboration between physicists and computer scientists that determines the topology of a toroidal magnetic field using fieldlines with near minimal lengths. More specifically, we analyze the Poincaré map of the sampled fieldlines in a Poincaré section including identifying critical points and other topological features of interest to physicists. The technique has been deployed into an interactiveparallel visualization tool which physicists are using to gain new insight into simulations of magnetically confined burning plasmas.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613484/","LOCKED","5613484","SCI Institute, University of Utah","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283733200","1","Allen Sanderson","37283733200","SCI Institute, University of Utah","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37069800000","2","Guoning Chen","37069800000","Purdue University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282575100","3","Xavier Tricoche","37282575100","Oak Ridge National Laboratory","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37394779900","4","David Pugmire","37394779900","Tech-X Corporation","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37411319500","5","Scott Kruger","37411319500","Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591115800","6","Joshua Breslau","37591115800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","22","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.133","1440","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=5613484","Confined magnetic fusion","magnetic field visualization","Poincaré","map","periodic magnetic fieldlines","recurrent patterns","","","","Toroidal magnetic fields","Windings","Magnetic separation","Orbits","Feature extraction","Plasmas","Visualization","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613484","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","36","1431","Analysis of Recurrent Patterns in Toroidal Magnetic Fields","16"
"In many common data analysis scenarios the data elements are logically grouped into sets. Venn and Euler style diagrams are a common visual representation of such set membership where the data elements are represented by labels or glyphs and sets are indicated by boundaries surrounding their members. Generating such diagrams automatically such that set regions do not intersect unless the corresponding sets have a non-empty intersection is a difficult problem. Further, it may be impossible in some cases if regions are required to be continuous and convex. Several approaches exist to draw such set regions using more complex shapes, however, the resulting diagrams can be difficult to interpret. In this paper we present two novel approaches for simplifying a complex collection of intersecting sets into a strict hierarchy that can be more easily automatically arranged and drawn (Figure 1). In the first approach, we use compact rectangular shapes for drawing each set, attempting to improve the readability of the set intersections. In the second approach, we avoid drawing intersecting set regions by duplicating elements belonging to multiple sets. We compared both of our techniques to the traditional non-convex region technique using five readability tasks. Our results show that the compact rectangular shapes technique was often preferred by experimental subjects even though the use of duplications dramatically improves the accuracy and performance time for most of our tasks. In addition to general set representation our techniques are also applicable to visualization of networks with intersecting clusters of nodes.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613447/","LOCKED","5613447","Microsoft Research","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590950700","1","Nathalie Henry Riche","37590950700","Microsoft Corporation Microsoft Corporation","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37326161000","2","Tim Dwyer","37326161000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","78","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.210","1099","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613447/","Information Visualization","Euler diagrams","Set Visualization","Graph Visualization.","","","","","","Shape","Layout","Complexity theory","Visualization","Data visualization","Social network services","Semantics","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613447","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","37","1090","Untangling Euler Diagrams","16"
"We introduce the concept of a Visual Backchannel as a novel way of following and exploring online conversations about large-scale events. Microblogging communities, such as Twitter, are increasingly used as digital backchannels for timely exchange of brief comments and impressions during political speeches, sport competitions, natural disasters, and other large events. Currently, shared updates are typically displayed in the form of a simple list, making it difficult to get an overview of the fast-paced discussions as it happens in the moment and how it evolves over time. In contrast, our Visual Backchannel design provides an evolving, interactive, and multi-faceted visual overview of large-scale ongoing conversations on Twitter. To visualize a continuously updating information stream, we include visual saliency for what is happening now and what has just happened, set in the context of the evolving conversation. As part of a fully web-based coordinated-view system we introduce Topic Streams, a temporally adjustable stacked graph visualizing topics over time, a People Spiral representing participants and their activity, and an Image Cloud encoding the popularity of event photos by size. Together with a post listing, these mutually linked views support cross-filtering along topics, participants, and time ranges. We discuss our design considerations, in particular with respect to evolving visualizations of dynamically changing data. Initial feedback indicates significant interest and suggests several unanticipated uses.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613451/","LOCKED","5613451","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590950400","1","Marian Dörk","37590950400","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37603901200","2","Daniel Gruen","37603901200","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37276124700","3","Carey Williamson","37276124700","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37285000100","4","Sheelagh Carpendale","37285000100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","108","3","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.129","1138","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613451/","backchannel","information visualization","events","multiple views","microblogging","information retrieval","World Wide Web","","","Visualization","Twitter","Data visualization","Shape","Context","Real time systems","Streaming media","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613451","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","38","1129","A Visual Backchannel for Large-Scale Events","16"
"Multiple simulation runs using the same simulation model with different values of control parameters generate a large data set that captures the behavior of the modeled phenomenon. However, there is a conceptual and visual gap between the simulation model behavior and the data set that makes data analysis more difficult. We propose a simulation model view that helps to bridge that gap by visually combining the simulation model description and the generated data. The simulation model view provides a visual outline of the simulation process and the corresponding simulation model. The view is integrated in a Coordinated Multiple Views; (CMV) system. As the simulation model view provides a limited display space, we use three levels of details. We explored the use of the simulation model view, in close collaboration with a domain expert, to understand and tune an electronic unit injector (EUI). We also developed analysis procedures based on the view. The EUI is mostly used in heavy duty Diesel engines. We were mainly interested in understanding the model and how to tune it for three different operation modes: low emission, low consumption, and high power. Very positive feedback from the domain expert shows that the use of the simulation model view and the corresponding ;analysis procedures within a CMV system represents an effective technique for interactive visual analysis of multiple simulation runs.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613486/","LOCKED","5613486","VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38220979200","1","Krešimir Matković","38220979200","Virginia Tech","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272650400","2","Denis Gračanin","37272650400","AVL AST Croatia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38230314200","3","Mario Jelović","38230314200","VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38230294200","4","Andreas Ammer","38230294200","VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38227888900","5","Alan Lež","38227888900","University of Bergen, Norway","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274158800","6","Helwig Hauser","37274158800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","23","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.171","1457","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613486/","visualization in physical sciences and engineering","time series data","coordinated multiple views","","","","","","","Computational modeling","Data models","Analytical models","Fuels","Visualization","Engines","Needles","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613486","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","39","1449","Interactive Visual Analysis of Multiple Simulation Runs Using the Simulation Model View: Understanding and Tuning of an Electronic Unit Injector","16"
"The rapid development of Web technology has resulted in an increasing number of hotel customers sharing their opinions on the hotel services. Effective visual analysis of online customer opinions is needed, as it has a significant impact on building a successful business. In this paper, we present OpinionSeer, an interactive visualization system that could visually analyze a large collection of online hotel customer reviews. The system is built on a new visualization-centric opinion mining technique that considers uncertainty for faithfully modeling and analyzing customer opinions. A new visual representation is developed to convey customer opinions by augmenting well-established scatterplots and radial visualization. To provide multiple-level exploration, we introduce subjective logic to handle and organize subjective opinions with degrees of uncertainty. Several case studies illustrate the effectiveness and usefulness of OpinionSeer on analyzing relationships among multiple data dimensions and comparing opinions of different groups. Aside from data on hotel customer feedback, OpinionSeer could also be applied to visually analyze customer opinions on other products or services.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613449/","LOCKED","5613449","Dept. of Comput.

"We investigate the design of declarative, domain-specific languages for constructing interactive visualizations. By separating specification from execution, declarative languages can simplify development, enable unobtrusive optimization, and support retargeting across platforms. We describe the design of the Protovis specification language and its implementation within an object-oriented, statically-typed programming language (Java). We demonstrate how to support rich visualizations without requiring a toolkit-specific data model and extend Protovis to enable declarative specification of animated transitions. To support cross-platform deployment, we introduce rendering and event-handling infrastructures decoupled from the runtime platform, letting designers retarget visualization specifications (e.g., from desktop to mobile phone) with reduced effort. We also explore optimizations such as runtime compilation of visualization specifications, parallelized execution, and hardware-accelerated rendering. We present benchmark studies measuring the performance gains provided by these optimizations and compare performance to existing Java-based visualization tools, demonstrating scalability improvements exceeding an order of magnitude.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613453/","LOCKED","5613453","Comput.

"Graphics artists commonly employ physically-based simulation for the generation of effects such as smoke, explosions, and similar phenomena. The task of finding the correct parameters for a desired result, however, is difficult and time-consuming as current tools provide little to no guidance. In this paper, we present a new approach for the visual exploration of such parameter spaces. Given a three-dimensional scene description, we utilize sampling and spatio-temporal clustering techniques to generate a concise overview of the achievable variations and their temporal evolution. Our visualization system then allows the user to explore the simulation space in a goal-oriented manner. Animation sequences with a set of desired characteristics can be composed using a novel search-by-example approach and interactive direct volume rendering is employed to provide instant visual feedback.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613488/","LOCKED","5613488","Simon Fraser University, Canada","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37265895700","1","Stefan Bruckner","37265895700","Simon Fraser University, Canada","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275858700","2","Torsten Möller","37275858700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","64","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.190","1476","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613488/","Visual exploration","visual effects","clustering","time-dependent volume data","","","","","","Computational modeling","Visualization","Animation","Data visualization","Rendering (computer graphics)","Clustering algorithms","Image segmentation","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613488","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","42","1468","Result-Driven Exploration of Simulation Parameter Spaces for Visual Effects Design","16"
"We extend direct volume rendering with a unified model for generalized isosurfaces, also called interval volumes, allowing a wider spectrum of visual classification. We generalize the concept of scale-invariant opacity-typical for isosurface rendering-to semi-transparent interval volumes. Scale-invariant rendering is independent of physical space dimensions and therefore directly facilitates the analysis of data characteristics. Our model represents sharp isosurfaces as limits of interval volumes and combines them with features of direct volume rendering. Our objective is accurate rendering, guaranteeing that all isosurfaces and interval volumes are visualized in a crack-free way with correct spatial ordering. We achieve simultaneous direct and interval volume rendering by extending preintegration and explicit peak finding with data-driven splitting of ray integration and hybrid computation in physical and data domains. Our algorithm is suitable for efficient parallel processing for interactive applications as demonstrated by our CUDA implementation.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613492/","LOCKED","5613492","VISUS","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37393968500","1","Marco Ament","37393968500","VISUS","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268045000","2","Daniel Weiskopf","37268045000","University of Leeds","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282624500","3","Hamish Carr","37282624500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","14","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.145","1514","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=5613492","direct volume rendering","interval volume","isosurface","ray casting","preintegration","scale-invariant opacity","","","","Isosurfaces","Rendering (computer graphics)","Mathematical model","Polynomials","Transfer functions","","","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613492","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","43","1505","Direct Interval Volume Visualization","16"
"While a number of information visualization software frameworks exist, creating new visualizations, especially those that involve novel visualization metaphors, interaction techniques, data analysis strategies, and specialized rendering algorithms, is still often a difficult process. To facilitate the creation of novel visualizations we present a new software framework, behaviorism, which provides a wide range of flexibility when working with dynamic information on visual, temporal, and ontological levels, but at the same time providing appropriate abstractions which allow developers to create prototypes quickly which can then easily be turned into robust systems. The core of the framework is a set of three interconnected graphs, each with associated operators: a scene graph for high-performance 3D rendering, a data graph for different layers of semantically-linked heterogeneous data, and a timing graph for sophisticated control of scheduling, interaction, and animation. In particular, the timing graph provides a unified system to add behaviors to both data and visual elements, as well as to the behaviors themselves. To evaluate the framework we look briefly at three different projects all of which required novel visualizations in different domains, and all of which worked with dynamic data in different ways: an interactive ecological simulation, an information art installation, and an information visualization technique.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613455/","LOCKED","5613455","UCSB","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38180697500","1","Angus Forbes","38180697500","UCSB","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37265602700","2","Tobias Höllerer","37265602700","UCSB","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590949900","3","George Legrady","37590949900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","17","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.126","1171","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613455/","Visualization System and Toolkit Design (primary keyword)","Time-varying Data","Streaming Data","Animation","Visual Design","","","","","Data visualization","Visualization","Rendering (computer graphics)","Timing","Data models","Animation","Programming","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613455","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","44","1164","behaviorism: a framework for dynamic data visualization","16"
"Volume ray-casting with a higher order reconstruction filter and/or a higher sampling rate has been adopted in direct volume rendering frameworks to provide a smooth reconstruction of the volume scalar and/or to reduce artifacts when the combined frequency of the volume and transfer function is high. While it enables high-quality volume rendering, it cannot support interactive rendering due to its high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a fast high-quality volume ray-casting algorithm which effectively increases the sampling rate. While a ray traverses the volume, intensity values are uniformly reconstructed using a high-order convolution filter. Additional samplings, referred to as virtual samplings, are carried out within a ray segment from a cubic spline curve interpolating those uniformly reconstructed intensities. These virtual samplings are performed by evaluating the polynomial function of the cubic spline curve via simple arithmetic operations. The min max blocks are refined accordingly for accurate empty space skipping in the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm, also exploiting fast cubic texture filtering supported by programmable GPUs, offers renderings as good as a conventional ray-casting algorithm using high-order reconstruction filtering at the same sampling rate, while delivering 2.5x to 3.3x rendering speed-up.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613494/","LOCKED","5613494","Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37600709600","1","Byeonghun Lee","37600709600","Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37599808200","2","Jihye Yun","37599808200","Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37422552700","3","Jinwook Seo","37422552700","Korea University, Seoul, Korea","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37277951300","4","Byonghyo Shim","37277951300","Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37366743500","5","Yeong-Gil Shin","37366743500","Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37594632900","6","Bohyoung Kim","37594632900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.155","1532","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613494/","direct volume rendering","GPU","high quality","curve interpolation.","","","","","","Rendering (computer graphics)","Spline","Transfer functions","Image reconstruction","Interpolation","Filtering","Polynomials","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613494","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","45","1525","Fast High-Quality Volume Ray Casting with Virtual Samplings","16"
"Tag clouds have proliferated over the web over the last decade. They provide a visual summary of a collection of texts by visually depicting the tag frequency by font size. In use, tag clouds can evolve as the associated data source changes over time. Interesting discussions around tag clouds often include a series of tag clouds and consider how they evolve over time. However, since tag clouds do not explicitly represent trends or support comparisons, the cognitive demands placed on the person for perceiving trends in multiple tag clouds are high. In this paper, we introduce SparkClouds, which integrate sparklines into a tag cloud to convey trends between multiple tag clouds. We present results from a controlled study that compares SparkClouds with two traditional trend visualizations-multiple line graphs and stacked bar charts-as well as Parallel Tag Clouds. Results show that SparkClouds' ability to show trends compares favourably to the alternative visualizations.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613457/","LOCKED","5613457","Microsoft Research","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37293389400","1","Bongshin Lee","37293389400","Microsoft Research","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590950700","2","Nathalie Henry Riche","37590950700","Microsoft Research","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590950600","3","Amy K.

"The process of visualization can be seen as a visual communication channel where the input to the channel is the raw data, and the output is the result of a visualization algorithm. From this point of view, we can evaluate the effectiveness of visualization by measuring how much information in the original data is being communicated through the visual communication channel. In this paper, we present an information-theoretic framework for flow visualization with a special focus on streamline generation. In our framework, a vector field is modeled as a distribution of directions from which Shannon's entropy is used to measure the information content in the field. The effectiveness of the streamlines displayed in visualization can be measured by first constructing a new distribution of vectors derived from the existing streamlines, and then comparing this distribution with that of the original data set using the conditional entropy. The conditional entropy between these two distributions indicates how much information in the original data remains hidden after the selected streamlines are displayed. The quality of the visualization can be improved by progressively introducing new streamlines until the conditional entropy converges to a small value. We describe the key components of our framework with detailed analysis, and show that the framework can effectively visualize 2D and 3D flow data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613461/","LOCKED","5613461","The Ohio State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37598369700","1","Lijie Xu","37598369700","The Ohio State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403060100","2","Teng-Yok Lee","37403060100","The Ohio State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279493500","3","Han-Wei Shen","37279493500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","73","2","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.131","1224","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613461/","Flow field visualization","information theory","streamline generation.","","","","","","","Entropy","Histograms","Data visualization","Information theory","Three dimensional displays","Visualization","Streaming media","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613461","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","47","1216","An Information-Theoretic Framework for Flow Visualization","16"
"Applying certain visualization techniques to datasets described on unstructured grids requires the interpolation of variables of interest at arbitrary locations within the dataset's domain of definition. Typical solutions to the problem of finding the grid element enclosing a given interpolation point make use of a variety of spatial subdivision schemes. However, existing solutions are memory- intensive, do not scale well to large grids, or do not work reliably on grids describing complex geometries. In this paper, we propose a data structure and associated construction algorithm for fast cell location in unstructured grids, and apply it to the interpolation problem. Based on the concept of bounding interval hierarchies, the proposed approach is memory-efficient, fast and numerically robust.

"Statistical data associated with geographic regions is nowadays globally available in large amounts and hence automated methods to visually display these data are in high demand. There are several well-established thematic map types for quantitative data on the ratio-scale associated with regions: choropleth maps, cartograms, and proportional symbol maps. However, all these maps suffer from limitations, especially if large data values are associated with small regions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel type of quantitative thematic map, the necklace map. In a necklace map, the regions of the underlying two-dimensional map are projected onto intervals on a one-dimensional curve (the necklace) that surrounds the map regions. Symbols are scaled such that their area corresponds to the data of their region and placed without overlap inside the corresponding interval on the necklace. Necklace maps appear clear and uncluttered and allow for comparatively large symbol sizes. They visualize data sets well which are not proportional to region sizes. The linear ordering of the symbols along the necklace facilitates an easy comparison of symbol sizes. One map can contain several nested or disjoint necklaces to visualize clustered data. The advantages of necklace maps come at a price: the association between a symbol and its region is weaker than with other types of maps. Interactivity can help to strengthen this association if necessary. We present an automated approach to generate necklace maps which allows the user to interactively control the final symbol placement. We validate our approach with experiments using various data sets and maps.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613424/","LOCKED","5613424","Tech. Univ.

"Most images used in visualization are computed with the planar pinhole camera. This classic camera model has important advantages such as simplicity, which enables efficient software and hardware implementations, and similarity to the human eye, which yields images familiar to the user. However, the planar pinhole camera has only a single viewpoint, which limits images to parts of the scene to which there is direct line of sight. In this paper we introduce the curved ray camera to address the single viewpoint limitation. Rays are C1-continuous curves that bend to circumvent occluders. Our camera is designed to provide a fast 3-D point projection operation, which enables interactive visualization. The camera supports both 3-D surface and volume datasets. The camera is a powerful tool that enables seamless integration of multiple perspectives for overcoming occlusions in visualization while minimizing distortions.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613463/","LOCKED","5613463","Purdue University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593526600","1","Jian Cui","37593526600","University of Utah","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37398611400","2","Paul Rosen","37398611400","Purdue University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272425500","3","Voicu Popescu","37272425500","Purdue University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37359029500","4","Christoph Hoffmann","37359029500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","21","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.127","1242","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613463/","Alleviating occlusions","camera model","curved rays","multiperspective visualization","interactive visualization","","","","","Cameras","Rendering (computer graphics)","Data visualization","Visualization","Mathematical model","Computational modeling","Context","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613463","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","50","1235","A Curved Ray Camera for Handling Occlusions through Continuous Multiperspective Visualization","16"
"We introduce a flexible technique for interactive exploration of vector field data through classification derived from user-specified feature templates. Our method is founded on the observation that, while similar features within the vector field may be spatially disparate, they share similar neighborhood characteristics. Users generate feature-based visualizations by interactively highlighting well-accepted and domain specific representative feature points. Feature exploration begins with the computation of attributes that describe the neighborhood of each sample within the input vector field. Compilation of these attributes forms a representation of the vector field samples in the attribute space. We project the attribute points onto the canonical 2D plane to enable interactive exploration of the vector field using a painting interface. The projection encodes the similarities between vector field points within the distances computed between their associated attribute points. The proposed method is performed at interactive rates for enhanced user experience and is completely flexible as showcased by the simultaneous identification of diverse feature types.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613498/","LOCKED","5613498","Sch. of Comput. & Sci.

"Radial visualizations play an important role in the information visualization community. But the decision to choose a radial coordinate system is rather based on intuition than on scientific foundations. The empirical approach presented in this paper aims at uncovering strengths and weaknesses of radial visualizations by comparing them to equivalent ones in Cartesian coordinate systems. We identified memorizing positions of visual elements as a generic task when working with visualizations. A first study with 674 participants provides a broad data spectrum for exploring differences between the two visualization types. A second, complementing study with fewer participants focuses on further questions raised by the first study. Our findings document that Cartesian visualizations tend to outperform their radial counterparts especially with respect to answer times. Nonetheless, radial visualization seem to be more appropriate for focusing on a particular data dimension.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613430/","LOCKED","5613430","University of Trier","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275546500","1","Stephan Diehl","37275546500","University of Trier","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586060300","2","Fabian Beck","37586060300","University of Stuttgart","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586953400","3","Michael Burch","37586953400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","33","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.209","942","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613430/","radial visualization","user study","visual memory","","","","","","","Visualization","Data visualization","Context","Accuracy","Shape","Color","Electronic mail","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613430","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","52","935","Uncovering Strengths and Weaknesses of Radial Visualizations---an Empirical Approach","16"
"In flow simulations the behavior and properties of particle trajectories often depend on the physical geometry contained in the simulated environment. Understanding the flow in and around the geometry itself is an important part of analyzing the data. Previous work has often utilized focus+context rendering techniques, with an emphasis on showing trajectories while simplifying or illustratively rendering the physical areas. Our research instead emphasizes the local relationship between particle paths and geometry by using a projected multi-field visualization technique. The correlation between a particle path and its surrounding area is calculated on-the-fly and displayed in a non-intrusive manner. In addition, we support visual exploration and comparative analysis through the use of linked information visualization, such as manipulatable curve plots and one-on-one similarity plots. Our technique is demonstrated on particle trajectories from a groundwater simulation and a computer room airflow simulation, where the flow of particles is highly influenced by the dense geometry.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613501/","LOCKED","5613501","Univ. of California, Davis, CA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37598134900","1","Chad Jones","37598134900","Univ. of California, Davis, CA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275869400","2","Kwan-Liu Ma","37275869400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.218","1594","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613501/","flow visualization","multi-field visualization","focus+context visualization","coordinated linked views","","","","","","Trajectory","Rendering (computer graphics)","Geometry","Data visualization","Solids","Context","Image color analysis","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613501","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","53","1587","Visualizing Flow Trajectories Using Locality-based Rendering and Warped Curve Plots","16"
"We are interested in 3-dimensional images given as arrays of voxels with intensity values. Extending these values to a continuous function, we study the robustness of homology classes in its level and interlevel sets, that is, the amount of perturbation needed to destroy these classes. The structure of the homology classes and their robustness, over all level and interlevel sets, can be visualized by a triangular diagram of dots obtained by computing the extended persistence of the function. We give a fast hierarchical algorithm using the dual complexes of oct-tree approximations of the function. In addition, we show that for balanced oct-trees, the dual complexes are geometrically realized in R3 and can thus be used to construct level and interlevel sets. We apply these tools to study 3-dimensional images of plant root systems.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613465/","LOCKED","5613465","IST Austria, Klosterneuburg, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590978100","1","Paul Bendich","37590978100","IST Austria, Klosterneuburg, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282291100","2","Herbert Edelsbrunner","37282291100","IST Austria, Klosterneuburg, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37605935300","3","Michael Kerber","37605935300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","48","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.139","1260","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=5613465","voxel arrays","oct-trees","persistent homology","persistence diagrams","level sets","robustness","approximations","plant roots","","Level set","Robustness","Approximation methods","Approximation algorithms","Diamond-like carbon","Software algorithms","Piecewise linear approximation","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613465","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","54","1251","Computing Robustness and Persistence for Images","16"
"In this work we present, apply, and evaluate a novel, interactive visualization model for comparative analysis of structural variants and rearrangements in human and cancer genomes, with emphasis on data integration and uncertainty visualization. To support both global trend analysis and local feature detection, this model enables explorations continuously scaled from the high-level, complete genome perspective, down to the low-level, structural rearrangement view, while preserving global context at all times. We have implemented these techniques in Gremlin, a genomic rearrangement explorer with multi-scale, linked interactions, which we apply to four human cancer genome data sets for evaluation. Using an insight-based evaluation methodology, we compare Gremlin to Circos, the state-of-the-art in genomic rearrangement visualization, through a small user study with computational biologists working in rearrangement analysis. Results from user study evaluations demonstrate that this visualization model enables more total insights, more insights per minute, and more complex insights than the current state-of-the-art for visual analysis and exploration of genome rearrangements.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613428/","LOCKED","5613428","Brown University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37587217600","1","Trevor O'Brien","37587217600","Brown University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591075900","2","Anna Ritz","37591075900","Brown University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271723100","3","Benjamin Raphael","37271723100","Brown University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275712600","4","David Laidlaw","37275712600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","18","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.163","926","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613428/","Information visualization","bioinformatics","insight-based evaluation.","","","","","","","Bioinformatics","Genomics","Biological cells","Humans","Data visualization","Visualization","Computational modeling","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613428","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","55","918","Gremlin: An Interactive Visualization Model for Analyzing Genomic Rearrangements","16"
"We introduce eSeeTrack, an eye-tracking visualization prototype that facilitates exploration and comparison of sequential gaze orderings in a static or a dynamic scene. It extends current eye-tracking data visualizations by extracting patterns of sequential gaze orderings, displaying these patterns in a way that does not depend on the number of fixations on a scene, and enabling users to compare patterns from two or more sets of eye-gaze data. Extracting such patterns was very difficult with previous visualization techniques. eSeeTrack combines a timeline and a tree-structured visual representation to embody three aspects of eye-tracking data that users are interested in: duration, frequency and orderings of fixations. We demonstrate the usefulness of eSeeTrack via two case studies on surgical simulation and retail store chain data. We found that eSeeTrack allows ordering of fixations to be rapidly queried, explored and compared. Furthermore, our tool provides an effective and efficient mechanism to determine pattern outliers. This approach can be effective for behavior analysis in a variety of domains that are described at the end of this paper.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613432/","LOCKED","5613432","University of Victoria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38258838800","1","Hoi Ying Tsang","38258838800","University of Victoria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275861300","2","Melanie Tory","37275861300","University of Victoria, Locarna Systems","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267462600","3","Colin Swindells","37267462600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","36","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.149","962","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613432/","eye-tracking","fixation pattern","timeline","tree-structured visualization","","","","","","Data visualization","Surgery","Image color analysis","Visualization","Promotion - marketing","Data models","Heating","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613432","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","56","953","eSeeTrack—Visualizing Sequential Fixation Patterns","16"
"We present TanGeoMS, a tangible geospatial modeling visualization system that couples a laser scanner, projector, and a flexible physical three-dimensional model with a standard geospatial information system (GIS) to create a tangible user interface for terrain data. TanGeoMS projects an image of real-world data onto a physical terrain model. Users can alter the topography of the model by modifying the clay surface or placing additional objects on the surface. The modified model is captured by an overhead laser scanner then imported into a GIS for analysis and simulation of real-world processes. The results are projected back onto the surface of the model providing feedback on the impact of the modifications on terrain parameters and simulated processes. Interaction with a physical model is highly intuitive, allowing users to base initial design decisions on geospatial data, test the impact of these decisions in GIS simulations, and use the feedback to improve their design. We demonstrate the system on three applications: investigating runoff management within a watershed, assessing the impact of storm surge on barrier islands, and exploring landscape rehabilitation in military training areas.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613503/","LOCKED","5613503","North Carolina State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550412000","1","Laura Tateosian","37550412000","North Carolina State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564680200","2","Helena Mitasova","37564680200","University of Oxford","","3","Brendan Harmon","","North Carolina State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37589580700","4","Brent Fogleman","37589580700","North Carolina State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37603897600","5","Katherine Weaver","37603897600","US Army Research Office","","6","Russel Harmon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","21","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.202","1612","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613503/","visualization system","geographic/geospatial visualization","terrain visualization","tangible user interface","collaborative visualization","human-computer interaction","","","","Solid modeling","Computational modeling","Analytical models","Data models","Surface topography","Geospatial analysis","","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613503","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","57","1605","TanGeoMS: Tangible Geospatial Modeling System","16"
"We present a technique for visualizing complicated mathematical surfaces that is inspired by hand-designed topological illustrations. Our approach generates exploded views that expose the internal structure of such a surface by partitioning it into parallel slices, which are separated from each other along a single linear explosion axis. Our contributions include a set of simple, prescriptive design rules for choosing an explosion axis and placing cutting planes, as well as automatic algorithms for applying these rules. First we analyze the input shape to select the explosion axis based on the detected rotational and reflective symmetries of the input model. We then partition the shape into slices that are designed to help viewers better understand how the shape of the surface and its cross-sections vary along the explosion axis. Our algorithms work directly on triangle meshes, and do not depend on any specific parameterization of the surface. We generate exploded views for a variety of mathematical surfaces using our system.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613471/","LOCKED","5613471","UC Berkeley","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37603800800","1","Olga Karpenko","37603800800","Adobe Systems","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37597594400","2","Wilmot Li","37597594400","KAUST / IIT Delhi","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591261000","3","Niloy Mitra","37591261000","UC Berkeley","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282718200","4","Maneesh Agrawala","37282718200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.151","1318","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=5613471","exploded view diagrams","mathematical visualization","symmetry","","","","","","","Explosions","Shape","Rendering (computer graphics)","Geometry","Three dimensional displays","Visualization","Algorithm design and analysis","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613471","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","58","1311","Exploded View Diagrams of Mathematical Surfaces","16"

"We present the first distributed paradigm for multiple users to interact simultaneously with large tiled rear projection display walls. Unlike earlier works, our paradigm allows easy scalability across different applications, interaction modalities, displays and users. The novelty of the design lies in its distributed nature allowing well-compartmented, application independent, and application specific modules. This enables adapting to different 2D applications and interaction modalities easily by changing a few application specific modules. We demonstrate four challenging 2D applications on a nine projector display to demonstrate the application scalability of our method: map visualization, virtual graffiti, virtual bulletin board and an emergency management system. We demonstrate the scalability of our method to multiple interaction modalities by showing both gesture-based and laser-based user interfaces. Finally, we improve earlier distributed methods to register multiple projectors. Previous works need multiple patterns to identify the neighbors, the configuration of the display and the registration across multiple projectors in logarithmic time with respect to the number of projectors in the display. We propose a new approach that achieves this using a single pattern based on specially augmented QR codes in constant time. Further, previous distributed registration algorithms are prone to large misregistrations. We propose a novel radially cascading geometric registration technique that yields significantly better accuracy. Thus, our improvements allow a significantly more efficient and accurate technique for distributed self-registration of multi-projector display walls.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613505/","LOCKED","5613505","University of California Irvine UCI","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37605184700","1","Pablo Roman","37605184700","University of California Irvine UCI","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37541336800","2","Maxim Lazarov","37541336800","University of California Irvine UCI","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37408075400","3","Aditi Majumder","37408075400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","21","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.128","1632","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613505/","Tiled Displays","Human-Computer Interaction","Gesture-Based Interaction","Multi-user interaction","Distributed algorithms","","","","","Cameras","Servers","History","Arrays","Algorithm design and analysis","Tracking","","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613505","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","60","1623","A Scalable Distributed Paradigm for Multi-User Interaction with Tiled Rear Projection Display Walls","16"
"The concept of continuous scatterplot (CSP) is a modern visualization technique. The idea is to define a scalar density value based on the map between an n-dimensional spatial domain and an m-dimensional data domain, which describe the CSP space. Usually the data domain is two-dimensional to visually convey the underlying, density coded, data. In this paper we investigate kinds of map-based discontinuities, especially for the practical cases n = m = 2 and n = 3 | m = 2, and we depict relations between them and attributes of the resulting CSP itself. Additionally, we show that discontinuities build critical line structures, and we introduce algorithms to detect them. Further, we introduce a discontinuity-based visualization approach - called contribution map (CM) -which establishes a relationship between the CSP's data domain and the number of connected components in the spatial domain.

"Stream surfaces are an intuitive approach to represent 3D vector fields. In many cases, however, they are challenging objects to visualize and to understand, due to a high degree of self-occlusion. Despite the need for adequate rendering methods, little work has been done so far in this important research area. In this paper, we present an illustrative rendering strategy for stream surfaces. In our approach, we apply various rendering techniques, which are inspired by the traditional flow illustrations drawn by Dallmann and Abraham & Shaw in the early 1980s. Among these techniques are contour lines and halftoning to show the overall surface shape. Flow direction as well as singularities on the stream surface are depicted by illustrative surface streamlines. ;To go beyond reproducing static text book images, we provide several interaction features, such as movable cuts and slabs allowing an interactive exploration of the flow and insights into subjacent structures, e.g., the inner windings of vortex breakdown bubbles. These methods take only the parameterized stream surface as input, require no further preprocessing, and can be freely combined by the user. We explain the design, GPU-implementation, and combination of the different illustrative rendering and interaction methods and demonstrate the potential of our approach by applying it to stream surfaces from various flow simulations.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613473/","LOCKED","5613473","Universität Leipzig","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590924500","1","Silvia Born","37590924500","Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37565763400","2","Alexander Wiebel","37565763400","Universität Leipzig","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37587961900","3","Jan Friedrich","37587961900","Universität Leipzig","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282574800","4","Gerik Scheuermann","37282574800","Universität Leipzig","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37448237300","5","Dirk Bartz","37448237300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","27","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.166","1338","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613473/","flow visualization","stream surfaces","illustrative rendering","silhouettes","GPU technique","3D vector fields","","","","Rendering (computer graphics)","Shape","Visualization","Streaming media","Pixel","Data visualization","Surface texture","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613473","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","62","1329","Illustrative Stream Surfaces","16"
"Treemaps are space-filling visualizations that make efficient use of limited display space to depict large amounts of hierarchical data. Creating perceptually effective treemaps requires carefully managing a number of design parameters including the aspect ratio and luminance of rectangles. Moreover, treemaps encode values using area, which has been found to be less accurate than judgments of other visual encodings, such as length. We conduct a series of controlled experiments aimed at producing a set of design guidelines for creating effective rectangular treemaps. We find no evidence that luminance affects area judgments, but observe that aspect ratio does have an effect. Specifically, we find that the accuracy of area comparisons suffers when the compared rectangles have extreme aspect ratios or when both are squares. Contrary to common assumptions, the optimal distribution of rectangle aspect ratios within a treemap should include non-squares, but should avoid extremes. We then compare treemaps with hierarchical bar chart displays to identify the data densities at which length-encoded bar charts become less effective than area-encoded treemaps. We report the transition points at which treemaps exhibit judgment accuracy on par with bar charts for both leaf and non-leaf tree nodes. We also find that even at relatively low data densities treemaps result in faster comparisons than bar charts. Based on these results, we present a set of guidelines for the effective use of treemaps and suggest alternate approaches for treemap layout.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613436/","LOCKED","5613436","University of California, Berkeley","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37599492800","1","Nicholas Kong","37599492800","Stanford University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550791300","2","Jeffrey Heer","37550791300","University of California, Berkeley","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282718200","3","Maneesh Agrawala","37282718200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","46","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.186","998","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613436/","Graphical Perception","Visualization","Treemaps","Rectangular Area","Visual Encoding","Experiment","Mechanical Turk","","","Encoding","Accuracy","Data visualization","Visualization","Layout","Bars","Guidelines","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613436","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","63","990","Perceptual Guidelines for Creating Rectangular Treemaps","16"
"When analyzing multidimensional, quantitative data, the comparison of two or more groups of dimensions is a common task. Typical sources of such data are experiments in biology, physics or engineering, which are conducted in different configurations and use replicates to ensure statistically significant results. One common way to analyze this data is to filter it using statistical methods and then run clustering algorithms to group similar values. The clustering results can be visualized using heat maps, which show differences between groups as changes in color. However, in cases where groups of dimensions have an a priori meaning, it is not desirable to cluster all dimensions combined, since a clustering algorithm can fragment continuous blocks of records. Furthermore, identifying relevant elements in heat maps becomes more difficult as the number of dimensions increases. To aid in such situations, we have developed Matchmaker, a visualization technique that allows researchers to arbitrarily arrange and compare multiple groups of dimensions at the same time. We create separate groups of dimensions which can be clustered individually, and place them in an arrangement of heat maps reminiscent of parallel coordinates. To identify relations, we render bundled curves and ribbons between related records in different groups. We then allow interactive drill-downs using enlarged detail views of the data, which enable in-depth comparisons of clusters between groups. To reduce visual clutter, we minimize crossings between the views. This paper concludes with two case studies. The first demonstrates the value of our technique for the comparison of clustering algorithms. In the second, biologists use our system to investigate why certain strains of mice develop liver disease while others remain healthy, informally showing the efficacy of our system when analyzing multidimensional data containing distinct groups of dimensions.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613440/","LOCKED","5613440","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37395933400","1","Alexander Lex","37395933400","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403918900","2","Marc Streit","37403918900","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591066400","3","Christian Partl","37591066400","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591065600","4","Karl Kashofer","37591065600","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37297103800","5","Dieter Schmalstieg","37297103800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","48","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.138","1035","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613440/","multidimensional data","cluster comparison","bioinformatics visualization.","","","","","","","Data visualization","Clustering algorithms","Image color analysis","Heating","Biological cells","Joining processes","","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613440","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","64","1027","Comparative Analysis of Multidimensional, Quantitative Data","16"
"In virtual colonoscopy, CT scans are typically acquired with the patient in both supine (facing up) and prone (facing down) positions. The registration of these two scans is desirable so that the user can clarify situations or confirm polyp findings at a location in one scan with the same location in the other, thereby improving polyp detection rates and reducing false positives. However, this supine-prone registration is challenging because of the substantial distortions in the colon shape due to the patient's change in position. We present an efficient algorithm and framework for performing this registration through the use of conformal geometry to guarantee that the registration is a diffeomorphism (a one-to-one and onto mapping). The taeniae coli and colon flexures are automatically extracted for each supine and prone surface, employing the colon geometry. The two colon surfaces are then divided into several segments using the flexures, and each segment is cut along a taenia coli and conformally flattened to the rectangular domain using holomorphic differentials. The mean curvature is color encoded as texture images, from which feature points are automatically detected using graph cut segmentation, mathematic morphological operations, and principal component analysis. Corresponding feature points are found between supine and prone and are used to adjust the conformal flattening to be quasi-conformal, such that the features become aligned. We present multiple methods of visualizing our results, including 2D flattened rendering, corresponding 3D endoluminal views, and rendering of distortion measurements. We demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of our registration method by illustrating matched views on both the 2D flattened colon images and in the 3D volume rendered colon endoluminal view. We analytically evaluate the correctness of the results by measuring the distance between features on the registered colons.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613475/","LOCKED","5613475","Stony Brook University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37393948000","1","Wei Zeng","37393948000","Stony Brook University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37605959300","2","Joseph Marino","37605959300","Stony Brook University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590931000","3","Krishna Chaitanya Gurijala","37590931000","Stony Brook University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37276603700","4","Xianfeng Gu","37276603700","Stony Brook University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268052800","5","Arie Kaufman","37268052800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","51","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.200","1357","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613475/","Data registration","geometry-based techniques","medical visualization","mathematical foundations for visualization.","","","","","","Colon","Conformal mapping","Feature extraction","Surface morphology","Visualization","Three dimensional displays","Harmonic analysis","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613475","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","65","1348","Supine and Prone Colon Registration Using Quasi-Conformal Mapping","16"
"Many of the pressing questions in information visualization deal with how exactly a user reads a collection of visual marks as information about relationships between entities. Previous research has suggested that people see parts of a visualization as objects, and may metaphorically interpret apparent physical relationships between these objects as suggestive of data relationships. We explored this hypothesis in detail in a series of user experiments. Inspired by the concept of implied dynamics in psychology, we first studied whether perceived gravity acting on a mark in a scatterplot can lead to errors in a participant's recall of the mark's position. The results of this study suggested that such position errors exist, but may be more strongly influenced by attraction between marks. We hypothesized that such apparent attraction may be influenced by elements used to suggest relationship between objects, such as connecting lines, grouping elements, and visual similarity. We further studied what visual elements are most likely to cause this attraction effect, and whether the elements that best predicted attraction errors were also those which suggested conceptual relationships most strongly. Our findings show a correlation between attraction errors and intuitions about relatedness, pointing towards a possible mechanism by which the perception of visual marks becomes an interpretation of data relationships.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613438/","LOCKED","5613438","UNC Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37548028800","1","Caroline Ziemkiewicz","37548028800","UNC Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282563400","2","Robert Kosara","37282563400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.174","1016","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613438/","Perceptual cognition","visualization models","laboratory studies","cognition theory","","","","","","Visualization","Gravity","Image color analysis","Layout","Joining processes","Data visualization","Dynamics","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613438","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","66","1009","Laws of Attraction: From Perceptual Forces to Conceptual Similarity","16"
"An ongoing challenge for information visualization is how to deal with over-plotting forced by ties or the relatively limited visual field of display devices. A popular solution is to represent local data density with area (bubble plots, treemaps), color(heatmaps), or aggregation (histograms, kernel densities, pixel displays). All of these methods have at least one of three deficiencies:1) magnitude judgments are biased because area and color have convex downward perceptual functions, 2) area, hue, and brightnesshave relatively restricted ranges of perceptual intensity compared to length representations, and/or 3) it is difficult to brush or link toindividual cases when viewing aggregations. In this paper, we introduce a new technique for visualizing and interacting with datasets that preserves density information by stacking overlapping cases. The overlapping data can be points or lines or other geometric elements, depending on the type of plot. We show real-dataset applications of this stacking paradigm and compare them to other techniques that deal with over-plotting in high-dimensional displays.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613442/","LOCKED","5613442","Dept. of Comput.

"Public genealogical databases are becoming increasingly populated with historical data and records of the current population's ancestors. As this increasing amount of available information is used to link individuals to their ancestors, the resulting trees become deeper and more dense, which justifies the need for using organized, space-efficient layouts to display the data. Existing layouts are often only able to show a small subset of the data at a time. As a result, it is easy to become lost when navigating through the data or to lose sight of the overall tree structure. On the contrary, leaving space for unknown ancestors allows one to better understand the tree's structure, but leaving this space becomes expensive and allows fewer generations to be displayed at a time. In this work, we propose that the H-tree based layout be used in genealogical software to display ancestral trees. We will show that this layout presents an increase in the number of displayable generations, provides a nicely arranged, symmetrical, intuitive and organized fractal structure, increases the user's ability to understand and navigate through the data, and accounts for the visualization requirements necessary for displaying such trees. Finally, user-study results indicate potential for user acceptance of the new layout.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613444/","LOCKED","5613444","University of Utah","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37605477900","1","Claurissa Tuttle","37605477900","Universidade do Sao Paulo, Brazil","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590974800","2","Luis Gustavo Nonato","37590974800","University of Utah","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275249200","3","Claudio Silva","37275249200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","16","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.185","1072","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613444/","Genealogy","Pedigree","H-Tree","","","","","","","Layout","Data visualization","Binary trees","Navigation","Software","Shape","Context","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613444","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","69","1063","PedVis: A Structured, Space-Efficient Technique for Pedigree Visualization","16"

In this paper we present a visualization framework that specifically targets interactive examination of arbitrarily large image stacks. Our framework is built upon two core techniques: display-aware processing and GPU-accelerated texture compression. With display-aware processing, only the currently visible image tiles are fetched and aligned on-the-fly, reducing memory bandwidth and minimizing the need for time-consuming global pre-processing. Our novel texture compression scheme for GPUs is tailored for quick browsing of image stacks.

"Numerical weather prediction ensembles are routinely used for operational weather forecasting. The members of these ensembles are individual simulations with either slightly perturbed initial conditions or different model parameterizations, or occasionally both. Multi-member ensemble output is usually large, multivariate, and challenging to interpret interactively. Forecast meteorologists are interested in understanding the uncertainties associated with numerical weather prediction; specifically variability between the ensemble members. Currently, visualization of ensemble members is mostly accomplished through spaghetti plots of a single midtroposphere pressure surface height contour. In order to explore new uncertainty visualization methods, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was used to create a 48-hour, 18 member parameterization ensemble of the 13 March 1993 ""Superstorm"". A tool was designed to interactively explore the ensemble uncertainty of three important weather variables: water-vapor mixing ratio, perturbation potential temperature, and perturbation pressure. Uncertainty was quantified using individual ensemble member standard deviation, inter-quartile range, and the width of the 95% confidence interval. Bootstrapping was employed to overcome the dependence on normality in the uncertainty metrics. A coordinated view of ribbon and glyph-based uncertainty visualization, spaghetti plots, iso-pressure colormaps, and data transect plots was provided to two meteorologists for expert evaluation. They found it useful in assessing uncertainty in the data, especially in finding outliers in the ensemble run and therefore avoiding the WRF parameterizations that lead to these outliers. Additionally, the meteorologists could identify spatial regions where the uncertainty was significantly high, allowing for identification of poorly simulated storm environments and physical interpretation of these model issues.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613483/","LOCKED","5613483","Mississippi State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37567906800","1","Jibonananda Sanyal","37567906800","Mississippi State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37277708500","2","Song Zhang","37277708500","Mississippi State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37408980300","3","Jamie Dyer","37408980300","Mississippi State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590976900","4","Andrew Mercer","37590976900","Mississippi State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37411386700","5","Philip Amburn","37411386700","Mississippi State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282559500","6","Robert Moorhead","37282559500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","135","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.181","1430","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613483/","Uncertainty visualization","weather ensemble","geographic/geospatial visualization","glyph-based techniques","timevarying data","qualitative evaluation","","","","Uncertainty","Data visualization","Weather forecasting","Numerical models","Atmospheric modeling","Predictive models","","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613483","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","71","1421","Noodles: A Tool for Visualization of Numerical Weather Model Ensemble Uncertainty","16"
"Graphs are a versatile structure and abstraction for binary relationships between objects. To gain insight into such relationships, their corresponding graph can be visualized. In the past, many classes of graphs have been defined, e.g. trees, planar graphs, directed acyclic graphs, and visualization algorithms were proposed for these classes. Although many graphs may only be classified as ""general"" graphs, they can contain substructures that belong to a certain class. Archambault proposed the TopoLayout framework: rather than draw any arbitrary graph using one method, split the graph into components that are homogeneous with respect to one graph class and then draw each component with an algorithm best suited for this class. Graph products constitute a class that arises frequently in graph theory, but for which no visualization algorithm has been proposed until now. In this paper, we present an algorithm for drawing graph products and the aesthetic criterion graph product's drawings are subject to. We show that the popular High-Dimensional Embedder approach applied to cartesian products already respects this aestetic criterion, but has disadvantages. We also present how our method is integrated as a new component into the TopoLayout framework. Our implementation is used for further research of graph products in a biological context.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613446/","LOCKED","5613446","Institute for Computer Science, University of Leipzig, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38243241100","1","Stefan Jänicke","38243241100","Institute for Computer Science, University of Leipzig, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37410427900","2","Christian Heine","37410427900","Institute for Computer Science, University of Leipzig, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590949800","3","Marc Hellmuth","37590949800","Institute for Computer Science, University of Leipzig, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271818100","4","Peter F.

Existing solutions operate at a very abstract level and only produce statistics. By applying techniques from information visualization to this problem, we were able to provide average people with a detailed and powerful tool for accessing their own musical past. LastHistory is an interactive visualization for displaying music listening histories, along with contextual information from personal photos and calendar entries. Its two main user tasks are (1) analysis, with an emphasis on temporal patterns and hypotheses related to musical genre and sequences, and (2) reminiscing, where listening histories and context represent part of one's past. In this design study paper we give an overview of the field of music listening histories and explain their unique characteristics as a type of personal data. We then describe the design rationale, data and view transformations of LastHistory and present the results from both a laband a large-scale online study. We also put listening histories in contrast to other lifelogging data. The resonant and enthusiastic feedback that we received from average users shows a need for making their personal data accessible. We hope to stimulate such developments through this research.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613450/","LOCKED","5613450","University of Munich (LMU)","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590949400","1","Dominikus Baur","37590949400","University of Munich (LMU)","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590946700","2","Frederik Seiffert","37590946700","University of Munich (LMU)","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590945600","3","Michael Sedlmair","37590945600","University of Munich (LMU)","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37299647500","4","Sebastian Boring","37299647500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","25","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.206","1128","","Information visualization","lifelogging","design study","music","listening history","timelines","photos","calendars","","History","Data visualization","Calendars","Context","Noise","Psychology","Image color analysis","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613450","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","73","1119","The Streams of Our Lives: Visualizing Listening Histories in Context","16"
"This paper presents an interactive visualization tool to study and analyze hyperspectral images (HSI) of historical documents. This work is part of a collaborative effort with the Nationaal Archief of the Netherlands (NAN) and Art Innovation, a manufacturer of hyperspectral imaging hardware designed for old and fragile documents. The NAN is actively capturing HSI of historical documents for use in a variety of tasks related to the analysis and management of archival collections, from ink and paper analysis to monitoring the effects of environmental aging. To assist their work, we have developed a comprehensive visualization tool that offers an assortment of visualization and analysis methods, including interactive spectral selection, spectral similarity analysis, time-varying data analysis and visualization, and selective spectral band fusion. This paper describes our visualization software and how it is used to facilitate the tasks needed by our collaborators. Evaluation feedback from our collaborators on how this tool benefits their work is included.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613485/","LOCKED","5613485","National University of Singapore","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37598033500","1","Seon Joo Kim","37598033500","National University of Singapore","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37531677100","2","Shaojie Zhuo","37531677100","National University of Singapore","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37589876300","3","Fanbo Deng","37589876300","Nanyang Technological University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37336329800","4","Chi-Wing Fu","37336329800","National University of Singapore","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37277811200","5","Michael Brown","37277811200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","18","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.172","1448","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613485/","Hyperspectral visualization","data exploration","image fusion","document processing and analysis","","","","","","Aging","Data visualization","Hyperspectral imaging","Strips","Lighting","Humidity","","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613485","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","74","1441","Interactive Visualization of Hyperspectral Images of Historical Documents","16"
"A standard approach for visualizing multivariate networks is to use one or more multidimensional views (for example, scatterplots) for selecting nodes by various metrics, possibly coordinated with a node-link view of the network. In this paper, we present three novel approaches for achieving a tighter integration of these views through hybrid techniques for multidimensional visualization, graph selection and layout. First, we present the FlowVizMenu, a radial menu containing a scatterplot that can be popped up transiently and manipulated with rapid, fluid gestures to select and modify the axes of its scatterplot. Second, the FlowVizMenu can be used to steer an attribute-driven layout of the network, causing certain nodes of a node-link diagram to move toward their corresponding positions in a scatterplot while others can be positioned manually or by force-directed layout. Third, we describe a novel hybrid approach that combines a scatterplot matrix (SPLOM) and parallel coordinates called the Parallel Scatterplot Matrix (P-SPLOM), which can be used to visualize and select features within the network. We also describe a novel arrangement of scatterplots called the Scatterplot Staircase (SPLOS) that requires less space than a traditional scatterplot matrix. Initial user feedback is reported.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613448/","LOCKED","5613448","École de technologie supérieure","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590930300","1","Christophe Viau","37590930300","École de technologie supérieure","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38526446600","2","Michael J.

"Data visualization is regularly promoted for its ability to reveal stories within data, yet these “data stories” differ in important ways from traditional forms of storytelling. Storytellers, especially online journalists, have increasingly been integrating visualizations into their narratives, in some cases allowing the visualization to function in place of a written story. In this paper, we systematically review the design space of this emerging class of visualizations. Drawing on case studies from news media to visualization research, we identify distinct genres of narrative visualization. We characterize these design differences, together with interactivity and messaging, in terms of the balance between the narrative flow intended by the author (imposed by graphical elements and the interface) and story discovery on the part of the reader (often through interactive exploration). Our framework suggests design strategies for narrative visualization, including promising under-explored approaches to journalistic storytelling and educational media.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613452/","LOCKED","5613452","Stanford University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590964100","1","Edward Segel","37590964100","Stanford University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550791300","2","Jeffrey Heer","37550791300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","319","2","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.179","1148","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613452/","Narrative visualization","storytelling","design methods","case study","journalism","social data analysis","","","","Data visualization","Visualization","Media","Image color analysis","Engineering profession","Economics","","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613452","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","76","1139","Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data","16"
"In this paper we present World Lines as a novel interactive visualization that provides complete control over multiple heterogeneous simulation runs. In many application areas, decisions can only be made by exploring alternative scenarios. The goal of the suggested approach is to support users in this decision making process. In this setting, the data domain is extended to a set of alternative worlds where only one outcome will actually happen. World Lines integrate simulation, visualization and computational steering into a single unified system that is capable of dealing with the extended solution space. World Lines represent simulation runs as causally connected tracks that share a common time axis. This setup enables users to interfere and add new information quickly. A World Line is introduced as a visual combination of user events and their effects in order to present a possible future. To quickly find the most attractive outcome, we suggest World Lines as the governing component in a system of multiple linked views and a simulation component. World Lines employ linking and brushing to enable comparative visual analysis of multiple simulations in linked views. Analysis results can be mapped to various visual variables that World Lines provide in order to highlight the most compelling solutions. To demonstrate this technique we present a flooding scenario and show the usefulness of the integrated approach to support informed decision making.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613487/","LOCKED","5613487","VRVis Vienna","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38111592300","1","Jurgen Waser","38111592300","ETH Zürich","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38099765400","2","Raphael Fuchs","38099765400","VRVis Vienna","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38229386600","3","Hrvoje Ribičič","38229386600","ETH Zürich","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38102461400","4","Benjamin Schindler","38102461400","TU Vienna","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38229402400","5","Gunther Blöschl","38229402400","TU Vienna","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282552200","6","Eduard Gröller","37282552200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","66","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.223","1467","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613487/","Problem solving environment","decision making","simulation steering","parallel worlds","CFD","smoothed particle hydrodynamics","","","","Visualization","Target tracking","Computational modeling","Data visualization","Analytical models","Navigation","","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613487","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","77","1458","World Lines","16"
"We investigate the use of a Fourier-domain derivative error kernel to quantify the error incurred while estimating the gradient of a function from scalar point samples on a regular lattice. We use the error kernel to show that gradient reconstruction quality is significantly enhanced merely by shifting the reconstruction kernel to the centers of the principal lattice directions. Additionally, we exploit the algebraic similarities between the scalar and derivative error kernels to design asymptotically optimal gradient estimation filters that can be factored into an infinite impulse response interpolation prefilter and a finite impulse response directional derivative filter. This leads to a significant performance gain both in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. The interpolation prefilter provides an accurate scalar approximation and can be re-used to cheaply compute directional derivatives on-the-fly without the need to store gradients. We demonstrate the impact of our filters in the context of volume rendering of scalar data sampled on the Cartesian and Body-Centered Cubic lattices. Our results rival those obtained from other competitive gradient estimation methods while incurring no additional computational or storage overhead.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613491/","LOCKED","5613491","Simon Fraser University,Burnaby, BC, Canada","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37402559800","1","Usman Alim","37402559800","Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275858700","2","Torsten Möller","37275858700","GREYC, A joint CNRS-UCBN-ENSICAEN Research Unit, Cedex,France","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294569700","3","Laurent Condat","37294569700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.160","1504","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613491/","Derivative","Gradient","Reconstruction","Sampling","Lattice","Body Centered Cubic Lattice","Interpolation","Approximation","Frequency Error Kernel","Spline","Kernel","Lattices","Image reconstruction","Estimation","Interpolation","","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613491","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","78","1495","Gradient Estimation Revitalized","16"

"Industrial cone-beam X-Ray computed tomography (CT) systems often face problems due to artifacts caused by a bad placement of the specimen on the rotary plate. This paper presents a visual-analysis tool for CT systems, which provides a simulation-based preview and estimates artifacts and deviations of a specimen's placement using the corresponding 3D geometrical surface model as input. The presented tool identifies potentially good or bad placements of a specimen and regions of a specimen, which cause the major portion of artefacts. The tool can be used for a preliminary analysis of the specimen before CT scanning, in order to determine the optimal way of placing the object. The analysis includes: penetration lengths, placement stability and an investigation in Radon space. Novel visualization techniques are applied to the simulation data. A stability widget is presented for determining the placement parameters' robustness. The performance and the comparison of results provided by the tool compared with real world data is demonstrated using two specimens.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613489/","LOCKED","5613489","Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, Vienna University of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590979900","1","Artem Amirkhanov","37590979900","Upper Austrian University of Applied Sciences, Wels Campus","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37400391300","2","Christoph Heinzl","37400391300","Upper Austrian University of Applied Sciences, Wels Campus","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593834800","3","Michael Reiter","37593834800","Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, Vienna University of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282552200","4","Eduard Gröller","37282552200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","16","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.214","1486","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613489/","Industrial 3DCT","simulation","Radon-space analysis","stability analysis","penetration-length analysis","","","","","Face","Stability analysis","Visualization","Computed tomography","Solid modeling","Three dimensional displays","Computational modeling","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613489","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","80","1477","Visual Optimality and Stability Analysis of 3DCT Scan Positions","16"
"Practical volume visualization pipelines are never without compromises and errors. A delicate and often-studied component is the interpolation of off-grid samples, where aliasing can lead to misleading artifacts and blurring, potentially hiding fine details of critical importance. The verifiable visualization framework we describe aims to account for these errors directly in the volume generation stage, and we specifically target volumetric data obtained via computed tomography (CT) reconstruction. In this case the raw data are the X-ray projections obtained from the scanner and the volume data generation process is the CT algorithm. Our framework informs the CT reconstruction process of the specific filter intended for interpolation in the subsequent visualization process, and this in turn ensures an accurate interpolation there at a set tolerance. Here, we focus on fast trilinear interpolation in conjunction with an octree-type mixed resolution volume representation without T-junctions. Efficient rendering is achieved by a space-efficient and locality-optimized representation, which can straightforwardly exploit fast fixed-function pipelines on GPUs.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613493/","LOCKED","5613493","Stony Brook University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37599599100","1","Ziyi Zheng","37599599100","Stony Brook University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37597172500","2","Wei Xu","37597172500","Stony Brook University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273119700","3","Klaus Mueller","37273119700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.211","1524","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613493/","Direct volume rendering","computed tomography","filtered back-projection","verifiable visualization","","","","","","Interpolation","Computed tomography","Rendering (computer graphics)","Data visualization","Frequency domain analysis","Pipelines","Image reconstruction","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613493","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","81","1515","VDVR: Verifiable Volume Visualization of Projection-Based Data","16"
"Documents in rich text corpora usually contain multiple facets of information. For example, an article about a specific disease often consists of different facets such as symptom, treatment, cause, diagnosis, prognosis, and prevention. Thus, documents may have different relations based on different facets. Powerful search tools have been developed to help users locate lists of individual documents that are most related to specific keywords. However, there is a lack of effective analysis tools that reveal the multifaceted relations of documents within or cross the document clusters. In this paper, we present FacetAtlas, a multifaceted visualization technique for visually analyzing rich text corpora. FacetAtlas combines search technology with advanced visual analytical tools to convey both global and local patterns simultaneously. We describe several unique aspects of FacetAtlas, including (1) node cliques and multifaceted edges, (2) an optimized density map, and (3) automated opacity pattern enhancement for highlighting visual patterns, (4) interactive context switch between facets. In addition, we demonstrate the power of FacetAtlas through a case study that targets patient education in the health care domain. Our evaluation shows the benefits of this work, especially in support of complex multifaceted data analysis.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613456/","LOCKED","5613456","Dept. of Comput.

"In this paper, we examine whether or not information theory can be one of the theoretic frameworks for visualization. We formulate concepts and measurements for qualifying visual information. We illustrate these concepts with examples that manifest the intrinsic and implicit use of information theory in many existing visualization techniques. We outline the broad correlation between visualization and the major applications of information theory, while pointing out the difference in emphasis and some technical gaps. Our study provides compelling evidence that information theory can explain a significant number of phenomena or events in visualization, while no example has been found which is fundamentally in conflict with information theory. We also notice that the emphasis of some traditional applications of information theory, such as data compression or data communication, may not always suit visualization, as the former typically focuses on the efficient throughput of a communication channel, whilst the latter focuses on the effectiveness in aiding the perceptual and cognitive process for data understanding and knowledge discovery. These findings suggest that further theoretic developments are necessary for adopting and adapting information theory for visualization.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613460/","LOCKED","5613460","Swansea University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37280982800","1","Min Chen","37280982800","Ruprecht-Karls-University Heidelberg","","2","Heike Jäenicke","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","84","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2010.132","1215","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613460/","Information theory","theory of visualization","quantitative evaluation","","","","","","","Data visualization","Visualization","Encoding","Entropy","Pixel","","","5613414","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613460","Nov.-Dec. 2010","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2010","IEEE","83","1206","An Information-theoretic Framework for Visualization","16"
