"In this paper we show an alternative approach to the standard data mining tools for detecting outliers both in sampling rates and in the measurements derived from those samples. Our interactive tool fits in the context of the VAST Mini Challenge 2, regarding the alleged chemical dumpings in the Boonsong Lekagul Wildlife Preserve. The approach developed comprises an interactive dashboard built in R using mainly the Plotly and Shiny packages that allows the user to choose the summary statistics for the sample sizes and to select which measurements (e.g. locations, chemicals) to analyse.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802453/","LOCKED","8802453","University of Buenos Aires","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086945861","1","Pablo Santoro","37086945861","University of Buenos Aires","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086945670","2","Rub√©n Flecha","37086945670","University of Buenos Aires","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086939168","3","Juan Pablo Pilorget","37086939168","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","21-26 Oct. 2018","Berlin, Germany","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2018.8802453","120","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802453/","Multivariate Analysis","Statistical Analysis","","","","","","R","Interactive Visualization","","","","","","","Pollution measurement","Distortion measurement","Conferences","Visual analytics","Chemicals","Atmospheric measurements","","","8802370","978-1-5386-6862-7","Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-6862-7","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-6861-0","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8802453","21-26 Oct. 2018","8792226","2018 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2018","IEEE","1","118","A Unified Approach For Sampling And Measurement Joint Analysis"
"This work proposes a visual analytic technique for visualizing temporal pattern detection in networks. The force-directed layout is a popular way to highlight structures of a network however it does not allow to present the dynamic features (how communities change over time). We target this problem by forcing nodes to display vertically and using the horizontal space for representing the timeline of entities. To show the connection between nodes, the edges are drawn vertically to avoid edge-crossings. This work also presents the result of applying the solution to the VAST 2018 - Mini Challenge 3 dataset, which led to the Honorable Mention: Representation of Small-Scale Temporal Patterns for the challenge.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802457/","LOCKED","8802457","Computer Science Department, Texas Tech University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086009087","1","Tommy Dang","37086009087","Computer Science Department, Texas Tech University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086600331","2","Vung V.

"Effectively combining machine learning techniques and visual analytics to support inferred results is an area of great importance. In this paper, we use the audio collection data provided as part of the 2018 VAST Challenge, which takes place in a fictitious natural preserve where a bird species has been claimed to be endangered by a polluting company. The goal of the mini challenge is to find evidence to support or refute the company's claim that the RoseCrested Blue Pipit (RCBP) is thriving across the Preserve. This required to characterize the patterns of all the bird species in the Preserve and classify newly collected audio recordings into their corresponding species.

"This work proposes a visual analytic solution which is well-designed to provide investigative functions with fluent interactions to analyze multi-dimensional temporal data. The solution allows users to view different dimensions of the data at different levels of details with a well-designed mixture of different visualizations and smooth interactions. At the general/overview level, various aggregation strategies are used to reduce data to be visualized, and different sorting procedures are used to cluster correlated data together to help discover patterns. Detail views are provided to explore and confirm/reject the identified patterns. Interaction and smooth transition between views are implemented to enable natural actions while performing analysis tasks. This work also presents the result of applying the solution to the VAST 2018 - Mini-Challenge (MC) 2 dataset, which led to the Strong Support for Exploratory Analysis award for the challenge.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802440/","LOCKED","8802440","Computer Science Department, Texas Tech University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086600331","1","Vung V.

"Figure 1.(A) Interactive spectrogram and (B) audio glyph - both views (A) and (B) show the same preprocessed supposed audio sample of a pipit call. (A) shows an interactive spectrogram and (B) an audio glyph that maps the spectral roll-off of the audio sample to a global linear color scale. three different bird calls (1-3) are visible in the spectrogram and the audio glyph.The VAST Challenge 2018 aims to clarify the situation of the Rose-Crested Blue Pipit's population in the Boonsong Lekagul Wildlife Preserve. We propose an interactive spectrogram and a representative novel audio glyph to support the classification of bird calls. The second visualization of our system helps to identify spatio-temporal patterns of bird species in the preserve. Using the system, we are able to solve the Mini Challenge 1 (MC1) tasks to classify claimed pipit calls and detect multiple spatio-temporal migratory patterns in the preserve. We find evidence that the pipit population is declining, but we can not identify any clear evidence that the accused company is responsible for the decrease of the pipit population.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802500/","LOCKED","8802500","Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087002703","1","Eren Cakmak","37087002703","Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086560746","2","Udo Schlegel","37086560746","Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086944048","3","Matthias Miller","37086944048","Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233607000","4","Juri Buchm√ºller","38233607000","Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086560996","5","Wolfgang Jentner","37086560996","Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","6","Daniel A.

"The goal of the VAST Challenge 2018 Mini Challenge 2 (MC 2) was to unveil the possible causes and effects of environmental pollution in the Boonsong Lekagul Wildlife Preserve. We propose the ViCCEx (Visual Chemical Contamination Explorer) system that enables to interactively explore the sparse multivariate river network sensor reading dataset to identify characteristics, trends, and outliers of the different sensor reading locations over time. The ViCCEx system uses a t-SNE projection to display an overview visualization, a sampling strategy view to highlight the overall sampling strategies of different chemical measurements at each sensor location, and various extracted statistics to highlight the evolution of chemical measurements. The three views are connected via linking and brushing, which enables to explore and identify possible pollution causes and effects in the preserve.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802502/","LOCKED","8802502","Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087002703","1","Eren Cakmak","37087002703","Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085831457","2","Daniel Seebacher","37085831457","Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233607000","3","Juri Buchm√ºller","38233607000","Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","4","Daniel A.

Neither approach alone would have been sufficient for the analysis.We describe our analysis of VAST Challenge 2018 Mini-Challenge 1. Our approach combines automatic analysis and interactive exploration. We improve user interaction and introduce new views to support analysis. At the same time, we design a convolutional neural network in order to compute a classifier of bird-singing audio files. The classifier and the interactive exploration tool are used to answer some of the challenge questions. Our analysis suggest that the audio files are most probably not of Pipits and, moreover, if there are Pipits among them, they are represented in minority.

"The datasets released for VAST 2018 Mini Challenge 2 pertain to sensor readings capturing chemical concentrations and physical properties from water bodies in the Boonsong Lekagul wildlife preserve. This challenge is in continuation to the VAST 2017 Challenge, where the company Kasios was identified as the culprit in dumping the chemical - Methylosmoline. In the absence of actual chemical measurements in the soil, challenge participants need to visualize chemical contamination based on the proximal water bodies to identify trends of interest. A horizon plot developed helps to narrow down the complete list of 106 chemicals provided to only 7, from where control charts are used to identify change points and periods of abnormal activity. In addition, a sequential sampling strategy to capture differences in chemical patterns along the flow of the river is recommended using a sunburst diagram.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802504/","LOCKED","8802504","Singapore Management University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086945829","1","Akangsha Bandalkul","37086945829","Singapore Management University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086942246","2","Angad Srivastava","37086942246","Singapore Management University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086943708","3","Kishan Bharadwaj Shridhar","37086943708","Singapore Management University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086562812","4","Ong Guan Jie Jason","37086562812","Singapore Management University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37679547500","5","Zhang Yanrong","37679547500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","21-26 Oct. 2018","Berlin, Germany","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2018.8802504","103","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802504/","Hydrology","Spatiotemporal analysis","","","","","","Horizon plot","Sunburst diagram","","","","","","","Chemicals","Pollution measurement","Frequency measurement","Data visualization","Time measurement","Market research","Rivers","","8802370","978-1-5386-6862-7","Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-6862-7","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-6861-0","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8802504","21-26 Oct. 2018","8792226","2018 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2018","IEEE","15","102","Unearthing the X-Streams: Visualizing Water Contamination : VAST Mini-Challenge 2 Honorable Mention: Clarity of Narrative"

"This paper introduces a novel visual analytics tool to analyze water contamination data. Bar charts and contour maps are used to inspect the data on an aggregate level. In order to identify both spatial and temporal patterns across all areas, we created a series of contour maps and used isolines to aggregate the readings. We also encoded the contours with color such that newer data were on the warmer spectrum (red/orange) and the older data were on the cooler spectrum (blue/green). Through panning, selecting, brushing, and filtering time scale, the user is able to identify patterns of interest in the data sets and highlight problem areas in the Preserve.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802508/","LOCKED","8802508","James Madison University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086942751","1","Chen Guo","37086942751","Naperville North High School","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086945363","2","Ryan Guan","37086945363","Adlai E.

"We present SMARTEXPLORE, a novel visual analytics technique that simplifies the identification and understanding of clusters, correlations, and complex patterns in high-dimensional data. The analysis is integrated into an interactive table-based visualization that maintains a consistent and familiar representation throughout the analysis. The visualization is tightly coupled with pattern matching, subspace analysis, reordering, and layout algorithms. To increase the analyst's trust in the revealed patterns, SMARTEXPLORE automatically selects and computes statistical measures based on dimension and data properties. While existing approaches to analyzing high-dimensional data (e.g., planar projections and Parallel coordinates) have proven effective, they typically have steep learning curves for non-visualization experts. Our evaluation, based on three expert case studies, confirms that non-visualization experts successfully reveal patterns in high-dimensional data when using SMARTEXPLORE.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802486/","LOCKED","8802486","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086249850","1","Michael Blumenschein","37086249850","Harvard University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38551542600","2","Michael Behrisch","38551542600","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086943825","3","Stefanie Schmid","37086943825","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37683008700","4","Simon Butscher","37683008700","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086941601","5","Deborah R.

"Social data charts - visual presentations of quantitative data about peer behaviors - may offer new means to motivate individuals to participate in group goals. However, to do so these charts need to create a semantic response of `unity' among the chart viewers in order to overcome the problems of social loafing where people act selfishly and undervalue the group's goal. In this paper, we focus on two properties of social data charts that may affect a viewer's perceptions of unity: (1) The skewness in the data structure - the statistical distribution of the social data, and (2) the proximity in the visual structure of the chart - the spatial organization of the data points. We performed a controlled perceptual experiment to examine the effect of proximity and skewness on four different semantic facets of perceived group unity: similarity, entitativity, rapport, and centrality. We exposed 179 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk to different group charts using a 2 x 2 factorial design, varying both proximity and skewness. Our two-way ANCOVA analyses reveal three important findings: (1) Across all conditions, proximity has a strong positive effect on perceived group unity and conveys a social meaning of group entitativity, as well as, member similarity and rapport; (2) Skewness and proximity interact in a non-linear way, suggesting that skewness creates a negative force that modifies the semantic responses to high proximity; and (3) The perceptual responses to proximity have different semantic facets that are either stable or sensitive to skewness. These findings contribute to perceptual as well as social InfoVis literature.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802449/","LOCKED","8802449","Purdue University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086942182","1","Marlen Promann","37086942182","Purdue University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37598999800","2","Sabine Brunswicker","37598999800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","21-26 Oct. 2018","Berlin, Germany","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2018.8802449","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802449/","Social visualization","information visualization","Human-centered computing","Empirical studies in HCI","Displays and imagers","Social engineering (social sciences)","Visualization theory, concepts and paradigms","Gestalt theory","controlled experiment","data density","data spread","perception","group identity","unity","priming","Visualization","Data visualization","Semantics","Data structures","Psychology","Social groups","Task analysis","","8802370","978-1-5386-6862-7","Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-6862-7","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-6861-0","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8802449","21-26 Oct. 2018","8792226","2018 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2018","IEEE","21","1","The Effect of Proximity in Social Data Charts on Perceived Unity"
"Completing text analysis tasks is a continuous sensemaking loop of foraging for information and incrementally synthesizing it into hypotheses. Past research has shown the advantages of using spatial workspaces as a means for synthesizing information through externalizing hypotheses and creating spatial schemas. However, spatializing the entirety of datasets becomes prohibitive as the number of documents available to the analysts grows, particularly when only a small subset are relevant to the task at hand. StarSPIRE is a visual analytics tool designed to explore collections of documents, leveraging users' semantic interactions to steer (1) a synthesis model that aids in document layout, and (2) a foraging model to automatically retrieve new relevant information. In contrast to traditional keyword search foraging (KSF), ‚Äúsemantic interaction foraging‚Äù (SIF) occurs as a result of the user's synthesis actions. To quantify the value of semantic interaction foraging, we use StarSPIRE to evaluate its utility for an intelligence analysis sensemaking task. Semantic interaction foraging accounted for 26% of useful documents found, and it also resulted in increased synthesis interactions and improved sensemaking task performance by users in comparison to only using keyword search.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802424/","LOCKED","8802424","Virginia Tech Computer Science","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233577000","1","John Wenskovitch","38233577000","Department of Defense","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37071531400","2","Lauren Bradel","37071531400","Virginia Tech Computer Science","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086544634","3","Michelle Dowling","37086544634","Virginia Tech Statistics","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38241765600","4","Leanna House","38241765600","Virginia Tech Computer Science","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37419565900","5","Chris North","37419565900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3","0","21-26 Oct. 2018","Berlin, Germany","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2018.8802424","24","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802424/","Human-centered computing","Visualization","","","","","","Empirical studies in visualization","Human-centered computing","Visualization","Visual analytics","","","","","Semantics","Layout","Task analysis","Analytical models","Computational modeling","Data visualization","Visual analytics","","8802370","978-1-5386-6862-7","Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-6862-7","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-6861-0","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8802424","21-26 Oct. 2018","8792226","2018 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2018","IEEE","22","13","The Effect of Semantic Interaction on Foraging in Text Analysis"
"The 2018 VAST Challenge returns to the (fictional) city of Mistford and the Boonsong Lekagul Wildlife Preserve to pose three MiniChallenges surrounding the nefarious Kasios Furniture Company and the fate of the Rose-Crested Blue Pipit. For Mini-Challenge 1, participants performed classification on a collection of bird song recordings to help experts understand the changing population dynamics within the preserve.

"Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to maliciously generated adversarial examples. These examples are intentionally designed by making imperceptible perturbations and often mislead a DNN into making an incorrect prediction. This phenomenon means that there is significant risk in applying DNNs to safety-critical applications, such as driverless cars. To address this issue, we present a visual analytics approach to explain the primary cause of the wrong predictions introduced by adversarial examples. The key is to analyze the datapaths of the adversarial examples and compare them with those of the normal examples. A datapath is a group of critical neurons and their connections. To this end, we formulate the datapath extraction as a subset selection problem and approximately solve it based on back-propagation. A multi-level visualization consisting of a segmented DAG (layer level), an Euler diagram (feature map level), and a heat map (neuron level), has been designed to help experts investigate datapaths from the high-level layers to the detailed neuron activations. Two case studies are conducted that demonstrate the promise of our approach in support of explaining the working mechanism of adversarial examples.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802509/","LOCKED","8802509","School of Software, Tsinghua University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077049000","1","Mengchen Liu","37077049000","School of Software, Tsinghua University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406039100","2","Shixia Liu","37406039100","Dept.of Comp.Sci.Tech., Tsinghua University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085416706","3","Hang Su","37085416706","School of Software, Tsinghua University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085845125","4","Kelei Cao","37085845125","Dept.of Comp.Sci.Tech., Tsinghua University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490433400","5","Jun Zhu","38490433400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","9","0","21-26 Oct. 2018","Berlin, Germany","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2018.8802509","71","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802509/","Deep neural networks","robustness","","","","","","adversarial examples","back propagation","multi-level visualization.","","","","","","Neurons","Visual analytics","Tools","Feature extraction","Biological neural networks","Machine learning","","","8802370","978-1-5386-6862-7","Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-6862-7","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-6861-0","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8802509","21-26 Oct. 2018","8792226","2018 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2018","IEEE","24","60","Analyzing the Noise Robustness of Deep Neural Networks"
"Getting the overall picture of how a large number of ego-networks evolve is a common yet challenging task. Existing techniques often require analysts to inspect the evolution patterns of ego-networks one after another. In this study, we explore an approach that allows analysts to interactively create spatial layouts in which each dot is a dynamic ego-network. These spatial layouts provide overviews of the evolution patterns of ego-networks, thereby revealing different global patterns such as trends, clusters and outliers in evolution patterns. To let analysts interactively construct interpretable spatial layouts, we propose a data transformation pipeline, with which analysts can adjust the spatial layouts and convert dynamic ego-networks into event sequences to aid interpretations of the spatial positions. Based on this transformation pipeline, we develop Segue, a visual analysis system that supports thorough exploration of the evolution patterns of ego-networks. Through two usage scenarios, we demonstrate how analysts can gain insights into the overall evolution patterns of a large collection of ego-networks by interactively creating different spatial layouts.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802415/","LOCKED","8802415","Georgia Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085886497","1","Po-Ming Law","37085886497","Visa Research","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086545509","2","Yanhong Wu","37086545509","Georgia Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37829310200","3","Rahul C.

"Online Distance Education (ODE) provides massive course videos of various specialties for students across the country to learn professional knowledge anytime and anywhere. Analyzing the utilization of these videos from user log data can help academics better understand the learning process of students, evaluate the quality of service provided by regional learning centers, and improve the quality of program curriculum in the future. However, due to the lack of comparable indicators, it is a great challenge to discover the utilization patterns of massive videos and analyze the learning process of large-scale student population from learning log data. In this paper, we introduce a visual analytics system, called VUSphere, to explore the video utilization from multiple perspectives with two proposed indicators. This system offers three coordinated views: a spherical layout overview to depict the overall utilization distribution of videos, courses, and students; a detailed statistics view with four panels to present video utilization statistics of each element from multiple perspectives; and a comparison view to examine the differences in individual elements. Based on the real dataset from our ODE school, several patterns related to video utilization and enrollment are found in the case study with our domain experts.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802383/","LOCKED","8802383","Key Laboratory of Intelligent Networks and Network Security, Ministry of Education, Xi‚Äôan Jiaotong University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085494153","1","Huan He","37085494153","Key Laboratory of Intelligent Networks and Network Security, Ministry of Education, Xi‚Äôan Jiaotong University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086945071","2","Oinghua Zheng","37086945071","School of Continuing Education, Xi‚Äôan Jiaotong University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546247500","3","Bo Dong","37546247500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","0","21-26 Oct. 2018","Berlin, Germany","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2018.8802383","35","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802383/","Video utilization pattern","online distance education","","","","","","visual analytics","","","","","","","","Education","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Sociology","Statistics","Layout","","","8802370","978-1-5386-6862-7","Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-6862-7","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-6861-0","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8802383","21-26 Oct. 2018","8792226","2018 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2018","IEEE","26","25","VUSphere: Visual Analysis of Video Utilization in Online Distance Education"
"Constructing latent vector representation for nodes in a network through embedding models has shown its practicality in many graph analysis applications, such as node classification, clustering, and link prediction. However, despite the high efficiency and accuracy of learning an embedding model, people have little clue of what information about the original network is preserved in the embedding vectors. The abstractness of low-dimensional vector representation, stochastic nature of the construction process, and non-transparent hyper-parameters all obscure understanding of network embedding results. Visualization techniques have been introduced to facilitate embedding vector inspection, usually by projecting the embedding space to a two-dimensional display. Although the existing visualization methods allow simple examination of the structure of embedding space, they cannot support in-depth exploration of the embedding vectors. In this paper, we design an exploratory visual analytics system that supports the comparative visual interpretation of embedding vectors at the cluster, instance, and structural levels. To be more specific, it facilitates comparison of what and how node metrics are preserved across different embedding models and investigation of relationships between node metrics and selected embedding vectors. Several case studies confirm the efficacy of our system. Experts' feedback suggests that our approach indeed helps them better embrace the understanding of network embedding models.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802454/","LOCKED","8802454","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085720737","1","Quan Li","37085720737","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086945915","2","Kristanto Sean Njotoprawiro","37086945915","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086732743","3","Hammad Haleem","37086732743","WeChat, Tencent Technology (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086945841","4","Qiaoan Chen","37086945841","WeChat, Tencent Technology (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086945693","5","Chris Yi","37086945693","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086496602","6","Xiaojuan Ma","37086496602","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2","0","21-26 Oct. 2018","Berlin, Germany","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2018.8802454","59","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802454/","Human-centered computing","Visualization","","","","","","Visualization application domains","Visual analytics","Human-centered computing","Visualization","Visualization design and evaluation methods","","","","Measurement","Task analysis","Analytical models","Visual analytics","Stochastic processes","Two dimensional displays","","","8802370","978-1-5386-6862-7","Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-6862-7","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-6861-0","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8802454","21-26 Oct. 2018","8792226","2018 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2018","IEEE","27","48","EmbeddingVis: A Visual Analytics Approach to Comparative Network Embedding Inspection"

"Summary form only given. In the past year, Augmented Reality (AR) has been introduced in several products of premier technology companies, addressing billions of mobile computing users. In particular, a new breed of AR games is engaging and visually appealing. In contrast, non-entertainment applications of AR generally tend to lack sophisticated content. This can be related to the fact that AR developers are only learning how to effectively use the new medium. But it also has to do with the lack of overlap in AR research and visualization research. While AR research has mostly been driven by computer vision with minimal consideration of the visual output, VIS is the field where the perceptual and cognitive foundations of visual information are studied. AR needs VIS! As AR matures, it will be vital to bring the two fields together. VIS needs to address the new medium AR, embracing its two key aspects: mobility and mixed real+virtual perception. AR poses new challenges for VIS, as the visual information needs to adapt to reality rather than shaping the entire visual domain. This talk will discuss fundamental properties of AR visualization and present examples of previous, current and future work.","","EPHEMERA","8802427","Graz University of Technology, Austria","","1","Dieter Schmalstieg","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","21-26 Oct. 2018","Berlin, Germany","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2018.8802427","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8802370","978-1-5386-6862-7","Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-6862-7","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-6861-0","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8802427","21-26 Oct. 2018","8792226","2018 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2018","IEEE","35","1","VIS Keynote Address : When Visualization Met Augmented Reality"

"Data Science promises us a methodology and algorithms to gain insights in ubiquitous Big Data. Sophisticated algorithmic techniques seek to identify and visualize non-accidental patterns that may be (causally) linked to mechanisms in the natural sciences, but also in the social sciences, medicine, technology, and governance. When we use machine learning algorithms to inspect the often high-dimensional, uncertain, and high-volume data to filter out and visualize relevant information, we aim to abstract from accidental factors in our experiments and thereby generalize over data fluctuations. Doing this, we often rely on highly nonlinear algorithms. This talk presents arguments advocating an information theoretic framework for algorithm analysis, where an algorithm is characterized as a computational evolution of a posterior distribution on the output space with a quantitative stopping criterion. The method allows us to investigate complex data analysis pipelines, such as those found in computational neuroscience, neurology, and molecular biology. I will demonstrate this concept for the validation of algorithms using the example of a statistical analysis of diffusion tensor imaging data. In addition, on the example of gene expression data, I will demonstrate how different spectral clustering methods can be validated by showing their robustness to data fluctuations and yet sufficient sensitivity to changes in the data. All in all, an information-theoretical method is presented for validating data analysis algorithms, offering the potential of more trustful results in Visual Analytics.","","EPHEMERA","8802482","ETH Zurich","","1","Joachim M.
