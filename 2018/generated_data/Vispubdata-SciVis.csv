conference_external,2019,Situ: Identifying and Explaining Suspicious Behavior in Networks,10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865029,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865029,204,214,Journals,"Despite the best efforts of cyber security analysts, networked computing assets are routinely compromised, resulting in the loss of intellectual property, the disclosure of state secrets, and major financial damages. Anomaly detection methods are beneficial for detecting new types of attacks and abnormal network activity, but such algorithms can be difficult to understand and trust. Network operators and cyber analysts need fast and scalable tools to help identify suspicious behavior that bypasses automated security systems, but operators do not want another automated tool with algorithms they do not trust. Experts need tools to augment their own domain expertise and to provide a contextual understanding of suspicious behavior to help them make decisions. In this paper we present Situ, a visual analytics system for discovering suspicious behavior in streaming network data. Situ provides a scalable solution that combines anomaly detection with information visualization. The system's visualizations enable operators to identify and investigate the most anomalous events and IP addresses, and the tool provides context to help operators understand why they are anomalous. Finally, operators need tools that can be integrated into their workflow and with their existing tools. This paper describes the Situ platform and its deployment in an operational network setting. We discuss how operators are currently using the tool in a large organization's security operations center and present the results of expert reviews with professionals.",,John R. Goodall;Eric D.

However, this rapid progress also brings enormous challenges. The opaque nature of a neural network model leads to hard-to-debug-systems and difficult-to-interpret mechanisms. Here, we introduce a visualization system that, through a tight yet flexible integration between visualization elements and the underlying model, allows a user to interrogate the model by perturbing the input, internal state, and prediction while observing changes in other parts of the pipeline. We use the natural language inference problem as an example to illustrate how a perturbation-driven paradigm can help domain experts assess the potential limitation of a model, probe its inner states, and interpret and form hypotheses about fundamental model mechanisms such as attention.",,Shusen Liu;Zhimin Li;Tao Li;Vivek Srikumar;Valerio Pascucci;Peer-Timo Bremer,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory;SCI InstituteUniversity of Utah;School of ComputingUniversity of Utah;School of ComputingUniversity of Utah;SCI InstituteUniversity of Utah;Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,,"Natural Language Processing,Interpretable Machine Learning,,Natural Language Inference,Attention Visualization,,,,,,",,8,,
SciVis,2019,Time-Dependent Flow seen through Approximate Observer Killing Fields,10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864839,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864839,1257,1266,Journals,"Flow fields are usually visualized relative to a global observer, i.e., a single frame of reference. However, often no global frame can depict all flow features equally well. Likewise, objective criteria for detecting features such as vortices often use either a global reference frame, or compute a separate frame for each point in space and time. We propose the first general framework that enables choosing a smooth trade-off between these two extremes. Using global optimization to minimize specific differential geometric properties, we compute a time-dependent observer velocity field that describes the motion of a continuous field of observers adapted to the input flow. This requires developing the novel notion of an observed time derivative. While individual observers are restricted to rigid motions, overall we compute an approximate Killing field, corresponding to almost-rigid motion. This enables continuous transitions between different observers. Instead of focusing only on flow features, we furthermore develop a novel general notion of visualizing how all observers jointly perceive the input field. This in fact requires introducing the concept of an observation time, with respect to which a visualization is computed. We develop the corresponding notions of observed stream, path, streak, and time lines. For efficiency, these characteristic curves can be computed using standard approaches, by first transforming the input field accordingly. Finally, we prove that the input flow perceived by the observer field is objective. This makes derived flow features, such as vortices, objective as well.",,Markus Hadwiger;Matej Mlejnek;Thomas Theußl;Peter Rautek,"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Visual Computing Center, Saudi Arabia;King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Visual Computing Center, Saudi Arabia;King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Core Labs, Saudi Arabia;King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Visual Computing Center, Saudi Arabia",,"Flow visualization,observer frames of reference,,Killing vector fields,infinitesimal isometries,Lie derivatives,objectivity,,,,",,5,,

They appear in numerous conceptual model depictions of extra-tropical weather systems. Conceptually, fronts are three-dimensional surfaces in space possessing an innate structural complexity, yet in meteorology, both manual and objective identification and depiction have historically focused on the structure in two dimensions. In this work, we -a team of visualization scientists and meteorologists-propose a novel visualization approach to analyze the three-dimensional structure of atmospheric fronts and related physical and dynamical processes. We build upon existing approaches to objectively identify fronts as lines in two dimensions and extend these to obtain frontal surfaces in three dimensions, using the magnitude of temperature change along the gradient of a moist potential temperature field as the primary identifying factor. We introduce the use of normal curves in the temperature gradient field to visualize a frontal zone (i.e., the transitional zone between the air masses) and the distribution of atmospheric variables in such zones. To enable for the first time a statistical analysis of frontal zones, we present a new approach to obtain the volume enclosed by a zone, by classifying grid boxes that intersect with normal curves emanating from a selected front. We introduce our method by means of an idealized numerical simulation and demonstrate its use with two real-world cases using numerical weather prediction data.",,Michael Kern;Tim Hewson;Andreas Schätler;Rüdiger Westermann;Marc Rautenhaus,"Computer Graphics & Visualization Group, Technische Universität München, Garching, Germany;European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, UK;Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR), Germany;Computer Graphics & Visualization Group, Technische Universität München, Garching, Germany;Computer Graphics & Visualization Group, Technische Universität München, Garching, Germany",,"Meteorology,Atmospheric Fronts,,Feature Detection,,,,,,,",,1,,

It integrates the process of writing data visualization code with description of the design choices that led to the implementation (design exposition). We develop a model of design exposition characterised by four visualization designer architypes: the evaluator, the autonomist, the didacticist and the rationalist. The model is used to justify the key characteristics of literate visualization: `notebook' documents that integrate live coding input, rendered output and textual narrative; low cost of authoring textual narrative; guidelines to encourage structured visualization design and its documentation. We propose narrative schemas for structuring and validating a wide range of visualization design approaches and models, and branching narratives for capturing alternative designs and design views. We describe a new open source literate visualization environment, litvis, based on a declarative interface to Vega and Vega-Lite through the functional programming language Elm combined with markdown for formatted narrative. We informally assess the approach, its implementation and potential by considering three examples spanning a range of design abstractions: new visualization idioms; validation though visualization algebra; and feminist data visualization. We argue that the rich documentation of the design process provided by literate visualization offers the potential to improve the validity of visualization design and so benefit both academic visualization and visualization practice.",,Jo Wood;Alexander Kachkaev;Jason Dykes,giCentreCity University of London;giCentreCity University of London;giCentreCity University of London,,"storytelling,design,,literate programming,theory,,,,,,",,6,,

Many of these systems have been developed with rich interactions, offering users the opportunity to examine details and explore hypotheses that have not been directly encoded by a designer. Understanding is enhanced when users can replay and revisit the steps in the sensemaking process, and in collaborative settings, it is especially important to be able to review not only the current state but also what decisions were made along the way. Unfortunately, many web-based systems lack the ability to capture such reasoning, and the path to a result is transient, forgotten when a user moves to a new view. This paper explores the requirements to augment existing client-side web applications with support for capturing, reviewing, sharing, and reusing steps in the reasoning process. Furthermore, it considers situations where decisions are made with streaming data, and the insights gained from revisiting those choices when more data is available. It presents a proof of concept, the Shareable Interactive Manipulation Provenance framework (SIMProv.js), that addresses these requirements in a modern, client-side JavaScript library, and describes how it can be integrated with existing frameworks.",,Akhilesh Camisetty;Chaitanya Chandurkar;Maoyuan Sun;David Koop,UMass Dartmouth;UMass Dartmouth;UMass Dartmouth;UMass Dartmouth,,"Collaboration,provenance,,streaming data,history,web,,,,,",,1,,

Charticulator is our response to most existing chart construction interfaces that require authors to choose from predefined chart layouts, thereby precluding the construction of novel charts. In contrast, Charticulator transforms a chart specification into mathematical layout constraints and automatically computes a set of layout attributes using a constraint-solving algorithm to realize the chart. It allows for the articulation of compound marks or glyphs as well as links between these glyphs, all without requiring any coding or knowledge of constraint satisfaction. Furthermore, thanks to the constraint-based layout approach, Charticulator can export chart designs into reusable templates that can be imported into other visualization tools. In addition to describing Charticulator's conceptual framework and design, we present three forms of evaluation: a gallery to illustrate its expressiveness, a user study to verify its usability, and a click-count comparison between Charticulator and three existing tools. Finally, we discuss the limitations and potentials of Charticulator as well as directions for future research.

The ensemble nature of the model helps random forests outperform any individual decision tree. However, it also leads to a poor model interpretability, which significantly hinders the model from being used in fields that require transparent and explainable predictions, such as medical diagnosis and financial fraud detection. The interpretation challenges stem from the variety and complexity of the contained decision trees. Each decision tree has its unique structure and properties, such as the features used in the tree and the feature threshold in each tree node. Thus, a data input may lead to a variety of decision paths. To understand how a final prediction is achieved, it is desired to understand and compare all decision paths in the context of all tree structures, which is a huge challenge for any users. In this paper, we propose a visual analytic system aiming at interpreting random forest models and predictions. In addition to providing users with all the tree information, we summarize the decision paths in random forests, which eventually reflects the working mechanism of the model and reduces users' mental burden of interpretation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, two usage scenarios and a qualitative user study are conducted.",,Xun Zhao;Yanhong Wu;Dik Lun Lee;Weiwei Cui,Hong Kong University of Science and Technology;Visa Research;Hong Kong University of Science and Technology;Microsoft Research Asia,,"Interpretable Machine Learning,Random Forests,,Random Forest Visualization,Visual Analytics,,,,,,",,10,,

A large number of techniques have been proposed to reduce visual clutter of flow maps, such as filtering, clustering and edge bundling, but the correlations of OD flows are often neglected, which makes the simplified OD flow map present little semantic information. In this paper, a characterization of OD flows is established based on an analogy between OD flows and natural language processing (NPL) terms. Then, an iterative multi-objective sampling scheme is designed to select OD flows in a vectorized representation space. To enhance the readability of sampled OD flows, a set of meaningful visual encodings are designed to present the interactions of OD flows. We design and implement a visual exploration system that supports visual inspection and quantitative evaluation from a variety of perspectives. Case studies based on real-world datasets and interviews with domain experts have demonstrated the effectiveness of our system in reducing the visual clutter and enhancing correlations of OD flows.",,Zhiguang Zhou;Linhao Meng;Cheng Tang;Ying Zhao;Zhiyong Guo;Miaoxin Hu;Wei Chen,School of InformationZhejiang University of Finance and Economics;State Key Lab of CAD & CGZhejiang University;Information SchoolZhejiang Sci-tech University;Central South University;School of InformationZhejiang University of Finance and Economics;School of InformationZhejiang University of Finance and Economics;State Key Lab of CAD & CGZhejiang University,,"Visual abstraction,human mobility,,origin-destination,flow map,representation learning,,,,,",,19,,

However, without extensive manual creation of meta information and annotations by the users, search and retrieval of analysis states can become tedious. We present KnowledgePearls, a solution for efficient retrieval of analysis states that are structured as provenance graphs containing automatically recorded user interactions and visualizations. As a core component, we describe a visual interface for querying and exploring analysis states based on their similarity to a partial definition of a requested analysis state. Depending on the use case, this definition may be provided explicitly by the user by formulating a search query or inferred from given reference states. We explain our approach using the example of efficient retrieval of demographic analyses by Hans Rosling and discuss our implementation for a fast look-up of previous states. Our approach is independent of the underlying visualization framework. We discuss the applicability for visualizations which are based on the declarative grammar Vega and we use a Vega-based implementation of Gapminder as guiding example. We additionally present a biomedical case study to illustrate how KnowledgePearls facilitates the exploration process by recalling states from earlier analyses.",,Holger Stitz;Samuel Gratzl;Harald Piringer;Thomas Zichner;Marc Streit,"Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria;Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria;VRVis Research Center, Austria;Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co KG, Austria;Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria",,"Visualization provenance,interaction provenance,,retrieval,,,,,,,",,4,,

A common strategy to deal with large-scale scientific simulation data is to partition the simulation domain and create statistical data summaries. Instead of storing the high-resolution raw data from the simulation, storing the compact statistical data summaries results in reduced storage overhead and alleviated I/O bottleneck. Such summaries, often represented in the form of statistical probability distributions, can serve various post-hoc analysis and visualization tasks. However, for multivariate simulation data using standard multivariate distributions for creating data summaries is not feasible. They are either storage inefficient or are computationally expensive to be estimated in simulation time (in situ) for large number of variables. In this work, using copula functions, we propose a flexible multivariate distribution-based data modeling and analysis framework that offers significant data reduction and can be used in an in situ environment. The framework also facilitates in storing the associated spatial information along with the multivariate distributions in an efficient representation. Using the proposed multivariate data summaries, we perform various multivariate post-hoc analyses like query-driven visualization and sampling-based visualization. We evaluate our proposed method on multiple real-world multivariate scientific datasets. To demonstrate the efficacy of our framework in an in situ environment, we apply it on a large-scale flow simulation.",,Subhashis Hazarika;Soumya Dutta;Han-Wei Shen;Jen-Ping Chen,The Department of Computer Science and EngineeringGRAVITY research groupThe Ohio State University;The Department of Computer Science and EngineeringGRAVITY research groupThe Ohio State University;The Department of Computer Science and EngineeringGRAVITY research groupThe Ohio State University;The Department of Mechanical and Aerospace EngineeringThe Ohio State University,,"In situ processing,Distribution-based,,Multivariate,Query-driven,Copula,,,,,",,3,,

Our application domain is Clinical Biostatistics, where models are derived from patient data with the aim to obtain clinically meaningful insights and consequences. Development and interpretation of a proper model requires domain expertise and insight into model characteristics. Because of time constraints, often a limited number of candidate models is evaluated. RegressionExplorer enables experts to quickly generate, evaluate, and compare many different models, taking the workflow for model development as starting point. Global patterns in parameter values of candidate models can be explored effectively. In addition, experts are enabled to compare candidate models across multiple subpopulations. The insights obtained can be used to formulate new hypotheses or to steer model development.

Many studies have demonstrated that visualization techniques for multi-dimensional data are beneficial to understand fuzzy clusters. However, no empirical evidence exists on the effectiveness and efficiency of these visualization techniques in solving analytical tasks featured by fuzzy clusters. In this paper, we conduct a controlled experiment to evaluate the ability of fuzzy clusters analysis to use four multi-dimensional visualization techniques, namely, parallel coordinate plot, scatterplot matrix, principal component analysis, and Radviz. First, we define the analytical tasks and their representative questions specific to fuzzy clusters analysis. Then, we design objective questionnaires to compare the accuracy, time, and satisfaction in using the four techniques to solve the questions. We also design subjective questionnaires to collect the experience of the volunteers with the four techniques in terms of ease of use, informativeness, and helpfulness. With a complete experiment process and a detailed result analysis, we test against four hypotheses that are formulated on the basis of our experience, and provide instructive guidance for analysts in selecting appropriate and efficient visualization techniques to analyze fuzzy clusters.",,Ying Zhao;Feng Luo;Minghui Chen;Yingchao Wang;Jiazhi Xia;Fangfang Zhou;Yunhai Wang;Yi Chen;Wei Chen,Central South University;Central South University;Central South University;Central South University;Central South University;Central South University;Shandong University;Beijing TechnologyBusiness University;State Key Lab of CAD & CGZhejiang University,,"Evaluation,multi-dimensional visualization,,fuzzy clustering,parallel coordinate plot,scatterplot matrix,principal component analysis,radviz,,,",,10,,

The most common solution, hover queries (i.e., tooltips), are fast and expressive but are usually limited to single mark (e.g., a bar in a bar chart). `Queries' to retrieve details for more complex sets of objects (e.g., comparisons between pairs of elements, averages across multiple items, trend lines, etc.) are difficult for end-users to invoke explicitly. Further, the output of these queries require complex annotations and overlays which need to be displayed and dismissed on demand to avoid clutter. In this work we introduce SmartCues, a library to support details-on-demand through dynamically computed overlays. For end-users, SmartCues provides multitouch interactions to construct complex queries for a variety of details. For designers, SmartCues offers an interaction library that can be used out-of-the-box, and can be extended for new charts and detail types. We demonstrate how SmartCues can be implemented across a wide array of visualization types and, through a lab study, show that end users can effectively use SmartCues.",,Hariharan Subramonyam;Eytan Adar,School of InformationUniversity of Michigan;School of InformationUniversity of Michigan,,"Graphical overlays,details-on-demand,,graph comprehension,,,,,,,",,0,,

Given the instance labels and worker reliability inferred from a learning-from-crowds model, candidate instances and workers are selected for expert validation. The influence of verified results is propagated to relevant instances and workers through the learning-from-crowds model. To facilitate the validation of annotations, we have developed a confusion visualization to indicate the confusing classes for further exploration, a constrained projection method to show the uncertain labels in context, and a scatter-plot-based visualization to illustrate worker reliability. The three visualizations are tightly integrated with the learning-from-crowds model to provide an iterative and progressive environment for data validation.

Additionally, it serves as the main visual mapping and navigation tool for examining the vast number of isosurfaces and exploring the underlying time-varying multivariate data set. We present temporal clustering, variable grouping, and interactive filtering to reduce the huge exploration space of MISM. In conjunction with the isovalue and isosurface views, MISM allows users to identify important isosurfaces or isosurface pairs and compare them over space, time, and value range. More importantly, we introduce path recommendation that suggests, animates, and compares traversal paths for effectively exploring MISM under varied criteria and at different levels-of-detail.

In this work, we focus on the linear correlation and non-linear dependency of different physical attributes of unsteady flows to aid their study from a new perspective. Specifically, we extend the existing spatial correlation quantification, i.e. the Local Correlation Coefficient (LCC), to the spatio-temporal domain to study the correlation of attribute-pairs from both the Eulerian and Lagrangian views. To study the dependency among attributes, which need not be linear, we extend and compute the mutual information (MI) among attributes over time. To help visualize and interpret the derived correlation and dependency among attributes associated with a particle, we encode the correlation and dependency values on individual pathlines. Finally, to utilize the correlation and MI computation results to identify regions with interesting flow behavior, we propose a segmentation strategy of the flow domain based on the ranking of the strength of the attributes relations. We have applied our correlation and dependency metrics to a number of 2D and 3D unsteady flows with varying spatio-temporal kernel sizes to demonstrate and assess their effectiveness.",,Marzieh Berenjkoub;Rodolfo Ostilla Monico;Robert S.

In this paper, we introduce a novel, scalable, tree-table multivariate graph visualization technique, which makes many tasks related to multivariate graph analysis easier to achieve. The core principle we follow is to selectively query for nodes or subgraphs of interest and visualize these subgraphs as a spanning tree of the graph. The tree is laid out linearly, which enables us to juxtapose the nodes with a table visualization where diverse attributes can be shown. We also use this table as an adjacency matrix, so that the resulting technique is a hybrid node-link/adjacency matrix technique. We implement this concept in Juniper and complement it with a set of interaction techniques that enable analysts to dynamically grow, restructure, and aggregate the tree, as well as change the layout or show paths between nodes.

The great complexity of these structures, in particular, those of RNA, demands interactive visualization to get deeper insights into the relationship between the 2D secondary structure motifs and their 3D tertiary structures. Over the last decades, a lot of research in molecular visualization has focused on the visual exploration of protein structures while nucleic acids have only been marginally addressed. In contrast to proteins, which are composed of amino acids, the ingredients of nucleic acids are nucleotides. They form structuring patterns that differ from those of proteins and, hence, also require different visualization and exploration techniques. In order to support interactive exploration of nucleic acids, the computation of secondary structure motifs as well as their visualization in 2D and 3D must be fast. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the performance of both the computation and visualization of nucleic acid structure. We present a ray casting-based visualization of RNA and DNA secondary and tertiary structures, which enables for the first time real-time visualization of even large molecular dynamics trajectories.

For example, the US National Hurricane Center generates multiple day predictions for a storm's path, size, and wind speed, and then uses a Monte Carlo approach to sample this prediction into a large ensemble of potential storm outcomes. Various forms of summary visualizations are generated from such an ensemble, often using spatial spread to indicate its statistical characteristics. However, studies have shown that changes in the size of such summary glyphs, representing changes in the uncertainty of the prediction, are frequently confounded with other attributes of the phenomenon, such as its size or strength. In addition, simulation ensembles typically encode multivariate information, which can be difficult or confusing to include in a summary display. This problem can be overcome by directly displaying the ensemble as a set of annotated trajectories, however this solution will not be effective if ensembles are densely overdrawn or structurally disorganized. We propose to overcome these difficulties by selectively sampling the original ensemble, constructing a smaller representative and spatially well organized ensemble. This can be drawn directly as a set of paths that implicitly reveals the underlying spatial uncertainty distribution of the prediction. Since this approach does not use a visual channel to encode uncertainty, additional information can more easily be encoded in the display without leading to visual confusion. To demonstrate our argument, we describe the development of a visualization for ensembles of tropical cyclone forecast tracks, explaining how their spatial and temporal predictions, as well as other crucial storm characteristics such as size and intensity, can be clearly revealed. We verify the effectiveness of this visualization approach through a cognitive study exploring how storm damage estimates are affected by the density of tracks drawn, and by the presence or absence of annotating information on storm size and intensity.",,Le Liu;Lace Padilla;Sarah H.

In this paper, we propose an ontology (VIS4ML) for a subarea of VA, namely “VA-assisted ML”. The purpose of VIS4ML is to describe and understand existing VA workflows used in ML as well as to detect gaps in ML processes and the potential of introducing advanced VA techniques to such processes. Ontologies have been widely used to map out the scope of a topic in biology, medicine, and many other disciplines. We adopt the scholarly methodologies for constructing VIS4ML, including the specification, conceptualization, formalization, implementation, and validation of ontologies. In particular, we reinterpret the traditional VA pipeline to encompass model-development workflows. We introduce necessary definitions, rules, syntaxes, and visual notations for formulating VIS4ML and make use of semantic web technologies for implementing it in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). VIS4ML captures the high-level knowledge about previous workflows where VA is used to assist in ML. It is consistent with the established VA concepts and will continue to evolve along with the future developments in VA and ML. While this ontology is an effort for building the theoretical foundation of VA, it can be used by practitioners in real-world applications to optimize model-development workflows by systematically examining the potential benefits that can be brought about by either machine or human capabilities.

For example, to interpret colormaps, people must determine how dimensions of color (e.g., lightness, hue) map onto quantities of a given measure (e.g., brain activity, correlation magnitude). This process is easier when the encoded mappings in the visualization match people's predictions of how visual features will map onto concepts, their inferred mappings. To harness this principle in visualization design, it is necessary to understand what factors determine people's inferred mappings. In this study, we investigated how inferred color-quantity mappings for colormap data visualizations were influenced by the background color. Prior literature presents seemingly conflicting accounts of how the background color affects inferred color-quantity mappings. The present results help resolve those conflicts, demonstrating that sometimes the background has an effect and sometimes it does not, depending on whether the colormap appears to vary in opacity. When there is no apparent variation in opacity, participants infer that darker colors map to larger quantities (dark-is-more bias). As apparent variation in opacity increases, participants become biased toward inferring that more opaque colors map to larger quantities (opaque-is-more bias). These biases work together on light backgrounds and conflict on dark backgrounds. Under such conflicts, the opaque-is-more bias can negate, or even supersede the dark-is-more bias. The results suggest that if a design goal is to produce colormaps that match people's inferred mappings and are robust to changes in background color, it is beneficial to use colormaps that will not appear to vary in opacity on any background color, and to encode larger quantities in darker colors.",,Karen B.

However, existing metrics of visualization interaction behavior used in research do not fully reveal the breadth of peoples' open-ended explorations with visualizations. One possible way to address this challenge is to determine high-level goals for visualization interaction metrics, and infer corresponding features from user interaction data that characterize different aspects of peoples' explorations of visualizations. In this paper, we identify needs for visualization behavior measurement, and develop corresponding candidate features that can be inferred from users' interaction data. We then propose metrics that capture novel aspects of peoples' open-ended explorations, including exploration uniqueness and exploration pacing. We evaluate these metrics along with four other metrics recently proposed in visualization literature by applying them to interaction data from prior visualization studies. The results of these evaluations suggest that these new metrics 1) reveal new characteristics of peoples' use of visualizations, 2) can be used to evaluate statistical differences between visualization designs, and 3) are statistically independent of prior metrics used in visualization research.

There are several aspect ratio selection methods for function plots and line charts, but only few can handle general, discrete diagrams such as 2D scatter plots. However, these methods either lack a perceptual foundation or heavily rely on intermediate isoline representations, which depend on choosing the right isovalues and are time-consuming to compute. This paper introduces a general image-based approach for selecting aspect ratios for a wide variety of 2D diagrams, ranging from scatter plots and density function plots to line charts. Our approach is derived from Federer's co-area formula and a line integral representation that enable us to directly construct image-based versions of existing selection methods using density fields. In contrast to previous methods, our approach bypasses isoline computation, so it is faster to compute, while following the perceptual foundation to select aspect ratios. Furthermore, this approach is complemented by an anisotropic kernel density estimation to construct density fields, allowing us to more faithfully characterize data patterns, such as the subgroups in scatterplots or dense regions in time series. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by quantitatively comparing to previous methods and revisiting a prior user study.

However, evaluating the impact of an uncertainty visualization is complex due to the difficulties that people have interpreting uncertainty and the challenge of defining correct behavior with uncertainty information. Currently, evaluators of uncertainty visualization must rely on general purpose visualization evaluation frameworks which can be ill-equipped to provide guidance with the unique difficulties of assessing judgments under uncertainty. To help evaluators navigate these complexities, we present a taxonomy for characterizing decisions made in designing an evaluation of an uncertainty visualization. Our taxonomy differentiates six levels of decisions that comprise an uncertainty visualization evaluation: the behavioral targets of the study, expected effects from an uncertainty visualization, evaluation goals, measures, elicitation techniques, and analysis approaches. Applying our taxonomy to 86 user studies of uncertainty visualizations, we find that existing evaluation practice, particularly in visualization research, focuses on Performance and Satisfaction-based measures that assume more predictable and statistically-driven judgment behavior than is suggested by research on human judgment and decision making. We reflect on common themes in evaluation practice concerning the interpretation and semantics of uncertainty, the use of confidence reporting, and a bias toward evaluating performance as accuracy rather than decision quality.

Instead, implicit error exists in the minds of experts, is mainly qualitative, and is accounted for subjectively during expert interpretation of the data. Externalizing knowledge surrounding implicit error can assist in synchronizing, validating, and enhancing interpretation, and can inform error analysis and mitigation. The framework consists of a description of implicit error components that are important for downstream analysis, along with a process model for externalizing and analyzing implicit error using visualization.

In visual analysis systems, projections embed multidimensional data into 2D or 3D spaces for graphical representation. To facilitate a robust and accurate analysis, essential characteristics of the multidimensional data shall be preserved when projecting. Orthographic star coordinates is a state-of-the-art linear projection method that avoids distortion of multidimensional clusters by restricting interactive exploration to orthographic projections. However, existing numerical methods for computing orthographic star coordinates have a number of limitations when putting them into practice. We overcome these limitations by proposing the novel concept of shape-preserving star coordinates where shape preservation is assured using a superset of orthographic projections. Our scheme is explicit, exact, simple, fast, parameter-free, and stable. To maintain a valid shape-preserving star-coordinates configuration during user interaction with one of the star-coordinates axes, we derive an algorithm that only requires us to modify the configuration of one additional compensatory axis. Different design goals can be targeted by using different strategies for selecting the compensatory axis. We propose and discuss four strategies including a strategy that approximates orthographic star coordinates very well and a data-driven strategy. We further present shape-preserving morphing strategies between two shape-preserving configurations, which can be adapted for the generation of data tours.

The center of the rotating motion is called the vortex coreline and its successful detection strongly depends on the choice of the reference frame. The optimal frame moves with the center of the vortex, which incidentally makes the observed fluid flow steady and thus standard vortex coreline extractors such as Sujudi-Haimes become applicable. Recently, an objective optimization framework was proposed that determines a near-steady reference frame for tracer particles. In this paper, we extend this technique to the detection of vortex corelines of inertial particles. An inertial particle is a finite-sized object that is carried by a fluid flow. In contrast to the usual tracer particles, they do not move tangentially with the flow, since they are subject to gravity and exhibit mass-dependent inertia. Their particle state is determined by their position and own velocity, which makes the search for the optimal frame a high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate in this paper that the objective detection of an inertial vortex coreline can be reduced in 2D to a critical point search in 2D. For 3D flows, however, the vortex coreline criterion remains a parallel vectors condition in 6D. To detect the vortex corelines we propose a recursive subdivision approach that is tailored to the underlying structure of the 6D vectors. The resulting algorithm is objective, and we demonstrate the vortex coreline extraction in a number of 2D and 3D vector fields.",,Tobias Günther;Holger Theisel,Computer Graphics LaboratoryETH Zürich;Visual Computing GroupUniversity of Magdeburg,,"Vortex extraction,inertial particles,,objectivity,vortex coreline,,,,,,",,1,,

Air traffic controllers for example deal with large quantities of aircrafts routes to optimize safety in airspace and neuroscientists attempt to understand neuronal pathways in the human brain by visualizing bundles of fibers from DTI images. Extracting insights from masses of 3D trajectories is challenging as the multiple three dimensional lines have complex geometries, may overlap, cross or even merge with each other, making it impossible to follow individual ones in dense areas. As trajectories are inherently spatial and three dimensional, we propose FiberClay: a system to display and interact with 3D trajectories in immersive environments. FiberClay renders a large quantity of trajectories in real time using GP-GPU techniques. FiberClay also introduces a new set of interactive techniques for composing complex queries in 3D space leveraging immersive environment controllers and user position.

Central to our experiment is a comparison between two ways to lay out ranges: a more conventional linear layout strikes a balance between quantitative and chronological scale resolution, while a less conventional radial layout emphasizes the cyclicality of time and may prioritize discrimination between values at its periphery. With results from 87 crowd workers, we found that while participants completed tasks more quickly with linear layouts than with radial ones, there were few differences in terms of error rate between layout conditions.

Currently, users of visualization software routinely rely on color mappings that have been pre-defined by the software. A default color mapping, however, cannot ensure an optimal perceptual separability between groups, and sometimes may even lead to a misinterpretation of the data. In this paper, we present an effective approach for color assignment based on a set of given colors that is designed to optimize the perception of scatterplots. Our approach takes into account the spatial relationships, density, degree of overlap between point clusters, and also the background color. For this purpose, we use a genetic algorithm that is able to efficiently find good color assignments. We implemented an interactive color assignment system with three extensions of the basic method that incorporates top K suggestions, user-defined color subsets, and classes of interest for the optimization.

Limitations observed in the prior attempts of integrating rankings with spatial contexts motivate us to develop a context-integrated visual ranking technique. Based on a set of generic design requirements we summarized by collaborating with domain experts, we propose SRVis, a novel spatial ranking visualization technique that supports efficient spatial multi-criteria decision-making processes by addressing three major challenges in the aforementioned context integration, namely, a) the presentation of spatial rankings and contexts, b) the scalability of rankings' visual representations, and c) the analysis of context-integrated spatial rankings. Specifically, we encode massive rankings and their cause with scalable matrix-based visualizations and stacked bar charts based on a novel two-phase optimization framework that minimizes the information loss, and the flexible spatial filtering and intuitive comparative analysis are adopted to enable the in-depth evaluation of the rankings and assist users in selecting the best spatial alternative.

We identify and motivate an appropriate task to investigate realistic judgments of uncertainty in the public domain through a qualitative analysis of uncertainty visualizations in the news. We contribute two crowdsourced experiments comparing the effectiveness of HOPs, error bars, and line ensembles for supporting perceptual decision-making from visualized uncertainty. Participants infer which of two possible underlying trends is more likely to have produced a sample of time series data by referencing uncertainty visualizations which depict the two trends with variability due to sampling error. By modeling each participant's accuracy as a function of the level of evidence presented over many repeated judgments, we find that observers are able to correctly infer the underlying trend in samples conveying a lower level of evidence when using HOPs rather than static aggregate uncertainty visualizations as a decision aid.

The marching squares (MS) algorithm for isocontour reconstruction generates a linear topology that is consistent with hyperbolic curves of a piecewise bilinear interpolation. The saddle points of the bilinear interpolant cause topological ambiguity in isocontour extraction. The midpoint decider and the asymptotic decider are well-known mathematical techniques for resolving topological ambiguities. The latter technique investigates the data values at the cell saddle points for ambiguity resolution. The uncertainty in data, however, leads to uncertainty in underlying bilinear interpolation functions for the MS algorithm, and hence, their saddle points. In our work, we study the behavior of the asymptotic decider when data at grid vertices is uncertain. First, we derive closed-form distributions characterizing variations in the saddle point values for uncertain bilinear interpolants. The derivation assumes uniform and nonparametric noise models, and it exploits the concept of ratio distribution for analytic formulations. Next, the probabilistic asymptotic decider is devised for ambiguity resolution in uncertain data using distributions of the saddle point values derived in the first step. Finally, the confidence in probabilistic topological decisions is visualized using a colormapping technique.

In particular, the Morse-Smale complex and its various components provide a rich framework for robust feature definition and computation. Consequently, there now exist a number of approaches to compute Morse-Smale complexes for large-scale data in parallel. However, existing techniques are based on discrete concepts which produce the correct topological structure but are known to introduce grid artifacts in the resulting geometry. Here, we present a new approach that combines parallel streamline computation with combinatorial methods to construct a high-quality discrete Morse-Smale complex. In addition to being invariant to the orientation of the underlying grid, this algorithm allows users to selectively build a subset of features using high-quality geometry. In particular, a user may specifically select which ascending/descending manifolds are reconstructed with improved accuracy, focusing computational effort where it matters for subsequent analysis. This approach computes Morse-Smale complexes for larger data than previously feasible with significant speedups. We demonstrate and validate our approach using several examples from a variety of different scientific domains, and evaluate the performance of our method.",,Attila Gyulassy;Peer-Timo Bremer;Valerio Pascucci,SCI InstituteUniversity of Utah;Lawrence Livermore National Lab;SCI InstituteUniversity of Utah,,"Morse complex,Parallel Computation,,Topology,Accurate Geometry,,,,,,",,5,,

Recent studies have indicated that changes and disruptions within such networks can serve as indicators for increased risks of violence and armed conflicts. This is especially true of countries that may not be able to compete for scarce commodities during supply shocks. Thus, network-induced vulnerability to supply disruption is typically exported from wealthier populations to disadvantaged populations. As such, researchers and stakeholders concerned with supply chains, political science, environmental studies, etc. need tools to explore the complex dynamics within global trade networks and how the structure of these networks relates to regional instability. However, the multivariate, spatiotemporal nature of the network structure creates a bottleneck in the extraction and analysis of correlations and anomalies for exploratory data analysis and hypothesis generation. Working closely with experts in political science and sustainability, we have developed a highly coordinated, multi-view framework that utilizes anomaly detection, network analytics, and spatiotemporal visualization methods for exploring the relationship between global trade networks and regional instability. Requirements for analysis and initial research questions to be investigated are elicited from domain experts, and a variety of visual encoding techniques for rapid assessment of analysis and correlations between trade goods, network patterns, and time series signatures are explored.

This operation is fundamental in high-level tasks, such as detecting recurring phenomena or creating clusters of similar temporal sequences. While automatic measures exist to compute time series similarity, human intervention is often required to visually inspect these automatically generated results. The visualization literature has examined similarity perception and its relation to automatic similarity measures for line charts, but has not yet considered if alternative visual representations, such as horizon graphs and colorfields, alter this perception. Motivated by how neuroscientists evaluate epileptiform patterns, we conducted two experiments that study how these three visualization techniques affect similarity perception in EEG signals. We seek to understand if the time series results returned from automatic similarity measures are perceived in a similar manner, irrespective of the visualization technique; and if what people perceive as similar with each visualization aligns with different automatic measures and their similarity constraints. Our findings indicate that horizon graphs align with similarity measures that allow local variations in temporal position or speed (i.e., dynamic time warping) more than the two other techniques. On the other hand, horizon graphs do not align with measures that are insensitive to amplitude and y-offset scaling (i.e., measures based on z-normalization), but the inverse seems to be the case for line charts and colorfields.

In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Volume Lines for the interactive visual analysis and comparison of sets of 3D volumes. Each volume is linearized along a Hilbert space-filling curve into a 1D Hilbert line plot, which depicts the intensities over the Hilbert indices. We present a nonlinear scaling of these 1D Hilbert line plots based on the intensity variations in the ensemble of 3D volumes, which enables a more effective use of the available screen space. The nonlinear scaling builds the basis for our interactive visualization techniques. An interactive histogram heatmap of the intensity frequencies serves as overview visualization. When zooming in, the frequencies are replaced by detailed 1D Hilbert line plots and optional functional boxplots. To focus on important regions of the volume ensemble, nonlinear scaling is incorporated into the plots. An interactive scaling widget depicts the local ensemble variations. Our brushing and linking interface reveals, for example, regions with a high ensemble variation by showing the affected voxels in a 3D spatial view. We show the applicability of our concepts using two case studies on ensembles of 3D volumes resulting from tomographic reconstruction. In the first case study, we evaluate an artificial specimen from simulated industrial 3D X-ray computed tomography (XCT). In the second case study, a real-world XCT foam specimen is investigated.

Fireflies are intelligent virtual light drones that illuminate the scene by traveling on a closed path.

We present a method for interactive labeling of crowded 3D scenes containing very many instances of objects spanning multiple scales in size. In contrast to previous labeling methods, we target cases where many instances of dozens of types are present and where the hierarchical structure of the objects in the scene presents an opportunity to choose the most suitable level for each placed label. Our solution builds on and goes beyond labeling techniques in medical 3D visualization, cartography, and biological illustrations from books and prints. In contrast to these techniques, the main characteristics of our new technique are: 1) a novel way of labeling objects as part of a bigger structure when appropriate, 2) visual clutter reduction by labeling only representative instances for each type of an object, and a strategy of selecting those. The appropriate level of label is chosen by analyzing the scene's depth buffer and the scene objects' hierarchy tree. We address the topic of communicating the parent-children relationship between labels by employing visual hierarchy concepts adapted from graphic design. Selecting representative instances considers several criteria tailored to the character of the data and is combined with a greedy optimization approach.

In particular, we propose a strategy to decompose the complex hex-mesh structure into multi-level sub-structures so that they can be studied separately, from which we identify a small set of the sub-structures that can most efficiently represent the whole mesh structure. Furthermore, from this set of sub-structures, we attempt to define the first metric for the quantification of the complexity of hex-mesh structure. To aid the exploration of the extracted multi-level structure information, we devise a visual exploration system coupled with a matrix view to help alleviate the common challenge of 3D data exploration (e.g., clutter and occlusion).

However, the integration with such automated approaches comes with a number of limitations, including significant error rates and the need for healthcare providers to fine-tune algorithms without expert knowledge of their inner mechanics. In addition, several of these approaches obscure or substitute the original clinical text and therefore fail to leverage qualitative and rhetorical flavours of the clinical notes.

To lower the barriers in interpreting its recommendations, Duet explains the recommended groups and attributes using both visualizations and textual descriptions.

The value equation contains components for the time savings a visualization provides, the insights and insightful questions it spurs, the overall essence of the data it conveys, and the confidence about the data and its domain it inspires. This articulation of value is purely descriptive, however, providing no actionable method of assessing a visualization's value. In this work, we create a heuristic-based evaluation methodology to accompany the value equation for assessing interactive visualizations. We refer to the methodology colloquially as ICE-T, based on an anagram of the four value components. Our approach breaks the four components down into guidelines, each of which is made up of a small set of low-level heuristics. Evaluators who have knowledge of visualization design principles then assess the visualization with respect to the heuristics. We conducted an initial trial of the methodology on three interactive visualizations of the same data set, each evaluated by 15 visualization experts. We found that the methodology showed promise, obtaining consistent ratings across the three visualizations and mirroring judgments of the utility of the visualizations by instructors of the course in which they were developed.",,Emily Wall;Meeshu Agnihotri;Laura Matzen;Kristin Divis;Michael Haass;Alex Endert;John Stasko,"Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA;Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA;Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM, USA;Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM, USA;Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM, USA;Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA;Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA",,"Visualization evaluation,heuristics,,value of visualization,,,,,,,",,4,,

In this paper, we propose a novel visual summarization technique for bipartite graphs based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle. The method simultaneously groups the two different set of nodes and constructs aggregated bipartite relations with balanced granularity and precision. It addresses the key trade-off that often occurs for visualizing large scale and noisy data: acquiring a clear and uncluttered overview while maximizing the information content in it. We formulate the visual summarization task as a co-clustering problem and propose an efficient algorithm based on locality sensitive hashing (LSH) that can easily scale to large graphs under reasonable interactive time constraints that previous related methods cannot satisfy. The method leads to the opportunity of introducing a visual analytics framework with multiple levels-of-detail to facilitate interactive data exploration. In the framework, we also introduce a compact visual design inspired by adjacency list representation of graphs as the building block for a small multiples display to compare the bipartite relations for different subsets of data. We showcase the applicability and effectiveness of our approach by applying it on synthetic data with ground truth and performing case studies on real-world datasets from two application domains including roll-call vote record analysis and vehicle fault pattern analysis.

A typical approach to explore such data utilizes interactive visualizations with multiple coordinated views. Each view displays the aggregated measures along one or two dimensions. By brushing on the views, analysts can obtain detailed information. However, this approach often cannot provide sufficient guidance for analysts to identify patterns hidden within subsets of data. Without a priori hypotheses, analysts need to manually select and iterate through different slices to search for patterns, which can be a tedious and lengthy process. In this work, we model multidimensional ST data as tensors and propose a novel piecewise rank-one tensor decomposition algorithm which supports automatically slicing the data into homogeneous partitions and extracting the latent patterns in each partition for comparison and visual summarization. The algorithm optimizes a quantitative measure about how faithfully the extracted patterns visually represent the original data. Based on the algorithm we further propose a visual analytics framework that supports a top-down, progressive partitioning workflow for level-of-detail multidimensional ST data exploration.

Spaghetti plots are conventional tools for meteorologists to directly examine the uncertainty exhibited by ensembles, where they simultaneously visualize isocontours of all ensemble members. To avoid visual clutter in practical usages, one needs to select a small number of informative isovalues for visual analysis. Moreover, due to the complex topology and variation of ensemble isocontours, it is often a challenging task to interpret the spaghetti plot for even a single isovalue in large ensembles. In this paper, we propose an interactive framework for uncertainty visualization of weather forecast ensembles that significantly improves and expands the utility of spaghetti plots in ensemble analysis. Complementary to state-of-the-art methods, our approach provides a complete framework for visual exploration of ensemble isocontours, including isovalue selection, interactive isocontour variability exploration, and interactive sub-region selection and re-analysis. Our framework is built upon the high-density clustering paradigm, where the mode structure of the density function is represented as a hierarchy of nested subsets of the data. We generalize the high-density clustering for isocontours and propose a bandwidth selection method for estimating the density function of ensemble isocontours. We present novel visualizations based on high-density clustering results, called the mode plot and the simplified spaghetti plot. The proposed mode plot visually encodes the structure provided by the high-density clustering result and summarizes the distribution of ensemble isocontours. It also enables the selection of subsets of interesting isocontours, which are interactively highlighted in a linked spaghetti plot for providing spatial context. To provide an interpretable overview of the positional variability of isocontours, our system allows for selection of informative isovalues from the simplified spaghetti plot. Due to the spatial variability of ensemble isocontours, the system allows for interactive selection and focus on sub-regions for local uncertainty and clustering re-analysis.

We present Manifold, a framework that utilizes visual analysis techniques to support interpretation, debugging, and comparison of machine learning models in a more transparent and interactive manner. Conventional techniques usually focus on visualizing the internal logic of a specific model type (i.e., deep neural networks), lacking the ability to extend to a more complex scenario where different model types are integrated. To this end, Manifold is designed as a generic framework that does not rely on or access the internal logic of the model and solely observes the input (i.e., instances or features) and the output (i.e., the predicted result and probability distribution). We describe the workflow of Manifold as an iterative process consisting of three major phases that are commonly involved in the model development and diagnosis process: inspection (hypothesis), explanation (reasoning), and refinement (verification). The visual components supporting these tasks include a scatterplot-based visual summary that overviews the models' outcome and a customizable tabular view that reveals feature discrimination.

Rather than fragmenting tasks across tools, the component model supports unification, where components-the building blocks of this model-can be assembled to support a wide range of tasks. Furthermore, the model also provides additional key properties, such as support for collaboration, sharing across multiple devices, and adaptive usage depending on expertise, from creating visualizations using dropdown menus, through instantiating components, to actually modifying components or creating entirely new ones from scratch using JavaScript or Python source code. To realize our model, we introduce Vistrates, a literate computing platform for developing, assembling, and sharing visualization components. From a visualization perspective, Vistrates features cross-cutting components for visual representations, interaction, collaboration, and device responsiveness maintained in a component repository. From a development perspective, Vistrates offers a collaborative programming environment where novices and experts alike can compose component pipelines for specific analytical activities.

We start by visualizing ensemble data instances in dimensionally reduced scatter plots. To understand these abstract views, we employ user-defined virtual data instances that, through direct manipulation, search an ensemble for similar instances. Users can create multiple of these direct manipulation queries to visually annotate the spaces with sets of highlighted ensemble data instances. User-defined goals are therefore translated into custom illustrations that are projected onto the dimensionally reduced spaces. Combined forward and inverse searches of the parameter space follow naturally allowing for continuous parameter space prediction and visual query comparison in the context of an ensemble.

Despite the strong performance of RNNs, it is often challenging for users to understand why the model makes a particular prediction. Such black-box nature of RNNs can impede its wide adoption in clinical practice. Furthermore, we have no established methods to interactively leverage users' domain expertise and prior knowledge as inputs for steering the model. Therefore, our design study aims to provide a visual analytics solution to increase interpretability and interactivity of RNNs via a joint effort of medical experts, artificial intelligence scientists, and visual analytics researchers. Following the iterative design process between the experts, we design, implement, and evaluate a visual analytics tool called RetainVis, which couples a newly improved, interpretable, and interactive RNN-based model called RetainEX and visualizations for users' exploration of EMR data in the context of prediction tasks. Our study shows the effective use of RetainVis for gaining insights into how individual medical codes contribute to making risk predictions, using EMRs of patients with heart failure and cataract symptoms.

This work puts forward a novel method to automatically identify spatial AoIs changing over time through a combination of clustering and cluster merging in the temporal domain.

Based on this we construct an algorithm for their extraction, which searches for intersections of a recirculation surface with lines defined in 3D. This reduces the problem to a repeated search for critical points in 3D vector fields. We provide a uniform sampling of the search space paired with a surface reconstruction and visualize results. This way, we present the first algorithm for a comprehensive feature extraction in the 5D flow map of a 3D flow.

Our framework, called Persistence Atlas, enables the visualization of the dominant spatial patterns of critical points, along with statistics regarding their occurrence in the ensemble. The persistence atlas represents in the geometrical domain each dominant pattern in the form of a confidence map for the appearance of critical points. As a by-product, our method also provides 2-dimensional layouts of the entire ensemble, highlighting the main trends at a global level. Our approach is based on the new notion of Persistence Map, a measure of the geometrical density in critical points which leverages the robustness to noise of topological persistence to better emphasize salient features. We show how to leverage spectral embedding to represent the ensemble members as points in a low-dimensional Euclidean space, where distances between points measure the dissimilarities between critical point layouts and where statistical tasks, such as clustering, can be easily carried out. Further, we show how the notion of mandatory critical point can be leveraged to evaluate for each cluster confidence regions for the appearance of critical points. Most of the steps of this framework can be trivially parallelized and we show how to efficiently implement them. Extensive experiments demonstrate the relevance of our approach. The accuracy of the confidence regions provided by the persistence atlas is quantitatively evaluated and compared to a baseline strategy using an off-the-shelf clustering approach. We illustrate the importance of the persistence atlas in a variety of real-life datasets, where clear trends in feature layouts are identified and analyzed.

We introduce a suitable and efficiently computable test to the visualization literature, demonstrate that it can be used to distinguish integrable from nonintegrable configurations in simulations, and apply it to whole-brain datasets of 15 healthy subjects. We conclude that streamsurface integrability is approximately satisfied in a substantial part of the brain, but not everywhere, including some regions of planarity.

This form of data captures information about the progression of events for an individual entity (e.g., a computer network device; a patient; an author) in the form of a series of time-stamped observations. Moreover, each event is associated with an event type (e.g., a computer login attempt, or a hospital discharge). Analyses of event sequence data have been shown to help reveal important temporal patterns, such as clinical paths resulting in improved outcomes, or an understanding of common career trajectories for scholars. Moreover, recent research has demonstrated a variety of techniques designed to overcome methodological challenges such as large volumes of data and high dimensionality. However, the effective identification and analysis of latent stages of progression, which can allow for variation within different but similarly evolving event sequences, remain a significant challenge with important real-world motivations.

However, in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), as well as in other domains, there are many situations where such a spatial overview is not relevant or practical for users, for example when the experts already have a good mental overview of the data, or when an analysis of a large overall structure may not be related to the specific, information-driven tasks of users. Using scientific workflow theory and, as a vehicle, the problem of viscous finger evolution, we advocate an alternative model that allows domain experts to explore features of interest first, then explore the context around those features, and finally move to a potentially unfamiliar summarization overview. In a model instantiation, we show how a computational back-end can identify and track over time low-level, small features, then be used to filter the context of those features while controlling the complexity of the visualization, and finally to summarize and compare simulations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach with an online web-based exploration of a total volume of data approaching half a billion seven-dimensional data points, and report supportive feedback provided by domain experts with respect to both the instantiation and the theoretical model.",,Timothy Luciani;Andrew Burks;Cassiano Sugiyama;Jonathan Komperda;G.

In cases where binocular vision is applied, it is almost exclusively used to convey depth by exposing stereo pairs. We present Deadeye, a novel preattentive visualization technique based on presenting different stimuli to each eye. The target object is rendered for one eye only and is instantly detected by our visual system. In contrast to existing cues, Deadeye does not modify any visual properties of the target and, thus, is particularly suited for visualization applications. Our evaluation confirms that Deadeye is indeed perceived preattentively.

Participants viewed 2D scatterplots where choices between superior alternatives were affected by the placement of other suboptimal points. We found that highlighting the superior alternatives weakened the bias, but did not eliminate it. We then tested an interactive approach where participants completely removed locally dominated points from the view, inspired by the elimination by aspects strategy in the decision-making literature.

However, effective exploration of large networks is often a challenge. While various tools are available for users to explore the global and local features of a network, these tools usually require significant interaction activities, such as repetitive navigation actions to follow network nodes and edges. In this paper, we propose a structure-based suggestive exploration approach to support effective exploration of large networks by suggesting appropriate structures upon user request. Encoding nodes with vectorized representations by transforming information of surrounding structures of nodes into a high dimensional space, our approach can identify similar structures within a large network, enable user interaction with multiple similar structures simultaneously, and guide the exploration of unexplored structures. We develop a web-based visual exploration system to incorporate this suggestive exploration approach and compare performances of our approach under different vectorizing methods and networks.

We focus on integer label data, whose efficient representation in memory, as well as fast random data access, pose an even greater challenge than the raw image data. Often, it is crucial to be able to rapidly identify which segments are located where, whether for empty space skipping for fast rendering, or for spatial proximity queries. We refer to this process as culling. In order to enable efficient culling of millions of labeled segments, we present a novel hybrid approach that combines deterministic and probabilistic representations of label data in a data-adaptive hierarchical data structure that we call the label list tree. In each node, we adaptively encode label data using either a probabilistic constant-time access representation for fast conservative culling, or a deterministic logarithmic-time access representation for exact queries. We choose the best data structures for representing the labels of each spatial region while building the label list tree. At run time, we further employ a novel query-adaptive culling strategy. While filtering a query down the tree, we prune it successively, and in each node adaptively select the representation that is best suited for evaluating the pruned query, depending on its size. We show an analysis of the efficiency of our approach with several large data sets from connectomics, including a brain scan with more than 13 million labeled segments, and compare our method to conventional culling approaches.

Based on the learners' needs and experts' recommendations, we then designed and developed InkPlanner, a novel pen and touch visualization tool that allows writers to utilize visual diagramming for ideation during prewriting. InkPlanner further allows writers to sort their ideas into a logical and sequential narrative by using a novel widget- NarrativeLine. Using a NarrativeLine, InkPlanner can automatically generate a document outline to guide later drafting exercises. Inkplanner is powered by machine-generated semantic and structural suggestions that are curated from various texts.

While many techniques such as transfer functions, volume segmentation or view distortion have been developed to address this, there is still room for improvement to better support the understanding of objects' vicinity. However, most existing Focus+Context fail to solve partial occlusion in datasets where the target and the occluder are very similar density-wise. For these reasons, we investigate a new technique which maintains the general structure of the investigated volumetric dataset while addressing occlusion issues. With our technique, the user interactively defines an area of interest where an occluded region or object is partially visible. Then our lens starts pushing at its border occluding objects, thus revealing hidden volumetric data. Next, the lens is modified with an extended field of view (fish-eye deformation) to better see the vicinity of the selected region. Finally, the user can freely explore the surroundings of the area under investigation within the lens. To provide real-time exploration, we implemented our lens using a GPU accelerated ray-casting framework to handle ray deformations, local lighting, and local viewpoint manipulation.

Participants completed these tasks across a variety of layouts: overlaid, two arrangements of juxtaposed small multiples, mirror-symmetric small multiples, and animated transitions. A staircase procedure sought the difficulty level (e.g., value change delta) that led to equivalent accuracy for each layout. Confirming prior intuition, we observe high levels of performance for overlaid versus standard small multiples.

NLG-based visualization systems typically leverage a suite of statistical functions to automatically extract key facts about the underlying data and surface them as natural language sentences alongside visualizations. With current systems, users are typically required to read the system-generated sentences and mentally map them back to the accompanying visualization. However, depending on the features of the visualization (e.g., visualization type, data density) and the complexity of the data fact, mentally mapping facts to visualizations can be a challenging task. Furthermore, more than one visualization could be used to illustrate a single data fact. Unfortunately, current tools provide little or no support for users to explore such alternatives. In this paper, we explore how system-generated data facts can be treated as interactive widgets to help users interpret visualizations and communicate their findings. We present Voder, a system that lets users interact with automatically-generated data facts to explore both alternative visualizations to convey a data fact as well as a set of embellishments to highlight a fact within a visualization. Leveraging data facts as interactive widgets, Voder also facilitates data fact-based visualization search. To assess Voder's design and features, we conducted a preliminary user study with 12 participants having varying levels of experience with visualization tools.

conference_external,2019,Clustrophile 2: Guided Visual Clustering Analysis,10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864477,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864477,267,276,Journals,"Data clustering is a common unsupervised learning method frequently used in exploratory data analysis. However, identifying relevant structures in unlabeled, high-dimensional data is nontrivial, requiring iterative experimentation with clustering parameters as well as data features and instances. The number of possible clusterings for a typical dataset is vast, and navigating in this vast space is also challenging. The absence of ground-truth labels makes it impossible to define an optimal solution, thus requiring user judgment to establish what can be considered a satisfiable clustering result. Data scientists need adequate interactive tools to effectively explore and navigate the large clustering space so as to improve the effectiveness of exploratory clustering analysis. We introduce Clustrophile 2, a new interactive tool for guided clustering analysis. Clustrophile 2 guides users in clustering-based exploratory analysis, adapts user feedback to improve user guidance, facilitates the interpretation of clusters, and helps quickly reason about differences between clusterings. To this end, Clustrophile 2 contributes a novel feature, the Clustering Tour, to help users choose clustering parameters and assess the quality of different clustering results in relation to current analysis goals and user expectations. We evaluate Clustrophile 2 through a user study with 12 data scientists, who used our tool to explore and interpret sub-cohorts in a dataset of Parkinson's disease patients. Results suggest that Clustrophile 2 improves the speed and effectiveness of exploratory clustering analysis for both experts and non-experts.",,Marco Cavallo;Çağatay Demiralp,IBM Research;MIT CSAIL & Fitnescity Labs,,"Clustering tour,Guided data analysis,Unsupervised learning,Exploratory data analysis,Interactive clustering analysis,Interpretability,Explainability,Visual data exploration recommendation,Dimensionality reduction,What-if analysis,Clustrophile",,8,,
SciVis,2019,Visual Analysis of Aneurysm Data using Statistical Graphics,10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864509,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864509,997,1007,Journals,"This paper presents a framework to explore multi-field data of aneurysms occurring at intracranial and cardiac arteries by using statistical graphics. The rupture of an aneurysm is often a fatal scenario, whereas during treatment serious complications for the patient can occur. Whether an aneurysm ruptures or whether a treatment is successful depends on the interaction of different morphological such as wall deformation and thickness, and hemodynamic attributes like wall shear stress and pressure. Therefore, medical researchers are very interested in better understanding these relationships. However, the required analysis is a time-consuming process, where suspicious wall regions are difficult to detect due to the time-dependent behavior of the data. Our proposed visualization framework enables medical researchers to efficiently assess aneurysm risk and treatment options. This comprises a powerful set of views including 2D and 3D depictions of the aneurysm morphology as well as statistical plots of different scalar fields. Brushing and linking aids the user to identify interesting wall regions and to understand the influence of different attributes on the aneurysm's state. Moreover, a visual comparison of pre- and post-treatment as well as different treatment options is provided. Our analysis techniques are designed in collaboration with domain experts, e.g., physicians, and we provide details about the evaluation.",,Monique Meuschke;Tobias Günther;Philipp Berg;Ralph Wickenhöfer;Bernhard Preim;Kai Lawonn,"University of Magdeburg, Germany;ETH Zürich, Switzerland;University of Magdeburg, Germany;Heart of Jesus Hospital, Germany;University of Magdeburg, Germany;University of Koblenz-Landau, Germany",,"Medical visualizations,aneurysms,,blood flow,parametrization,,,,,,",,1,,

Over the past years, immersive data visualizations in augmented and virtual reality (AR, VR) have been emerging as a promising medium for data sense-making beyond the desktop. However, creating immersive visualizations remains challenging, and often require complex low-level programming and tedious manual encoding of data attributes to geometric and visual properties. These can hinder the iterative idea-to-prototype process, especially for developers without experience in 3D graphics, AR, and VR programming. With DXR, developers can efficiently specify visualization designs using a concise declarative visualization grammar inspired by Vega-Lite. DXR further provides a GUI for easy and quick edits and previews of visualization designs in-situ, i.e., while immersed in the virtual world. DXR also provides reusable templates and customizable graphical marks, enabling unique and engaging visualizations. We demonstrate the flexibility of DXR through several examples spanning a wide range of applications.",,Ronell Sicat;Jiabao Li;Junyoung Choi;Maxime Cordeil;Won-Ki Jeong;Benjamin Bach;Hanspeter Pfister,Harvard Visual Computing Group;Harvard Graduate School of Design;Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology;Immersive Analytics LabMonash University;Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology;School of InformaticsEdinburgh University;Harvard Visual Computing Group,,"Augmented Reality,Virtual Reality,,Immersive Visualization,Immersive Analytics,Visualization Toolkit,,,,,",,12,,

This paper presents an explainable, mixed-initiative topic modeling framework that integrates speculative execution into the algorithmic decision-making process. Our approach visualizes the model-space of our novel incremental hierarchical topic modeling algorithm, unveiling its inner-workings. We support the active incorporation of the user's domain knowledge in every step through explicit model manipulation interactions. In addition, users can initialize the model with expected topic seeds, the backbone priors. For a more targeted optimization, the modeling process automatically triggers a speculative execution of various optimization strategies, and requests feedback whenever the measured model quality deteriorates. Users compare the proposed optimizations to the current model state and preview their effect on the next model iterations, before applying one of them. This supervised human-in-the-Ioop process targets maximum improvement for minimum feedback and has proven to be effective in three independent studies that confirm topic model quality improvements.",,Mennatallah El-Assady;Fabian Sperrle;Oliver Deussen;Daniel Keim;Christopher Collins,"University of Konstanz, Germany;University of Konstanz, Germany;University of Konstanz, Germany;University of Konstanz, Germany;University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Canada",,"User-Steerable Topic Modeling,Speculative Execution,,Mixed-Initiative Visual Analytics,Explainable Machine Learning,,,,,,",,7,,
