However, to do so these charts need to create a semantic response of `unity' among the chart viewers in order to overcome the problems of social loafing where people act selfishly and undervalue the group's goal. In this paper, we focus on two properties of social data charts that may affect a viewer's perceptions of unity: (1) The skewness in the data structure - the statistical distribution of the social data, and (2) the proximity in the visual structure of the chart - the spatial organization of the data points. We performed a controlled perceptual experiment to examine the effect of proximity and skewness on four different semantic facets of perceived group unity: similarity, entitativity, rapport, and centrality. We exposed 179 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk to different group charts using a 2 x 2 factorial design, varying both proximity and skewness. Our two-way ANCOVA analyses reveal three important findings: (1) Across all conditions, proximity has a strong positive effect on perceived group unity and conveys a social meaning of group entitativity, as well as, member similarity and rapport; (2) Skewness and proximity interact in a non-linear way, suggesting that skewness creates a negative force that modifies the semantic responses to high proximity; and (3) The perceptual responses to proximity have different semantic facets that are either stable or sensitive to skewness. These findings contribute to perceptual as well as social InfoVis literature.","article_number":"8802449","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8802449","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802449/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802449/","publication_title":"2018 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Berlin, Germany","conference_dates":"21-26 Oct. 2018","publication_number":8792226,"is_number":8802370,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"21-26 Oct. 2018","start_page":"1","end_page":"12","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Data visualization","Semantics","Data structures","Psychology","Social groups","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Social visualization","information visualization","Gestalt theory","controlled experiment","data density","data spread","perception","group identity","unity","priming","Human-centered computing","Empirical studies in HCI","Displays and imagers","Social engineering (social sciences)","Visualization theory, concepts and paradigms"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6862-7","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6861-0","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2018.8802424","title":"The Effect of Semantic Interaction on Foraging in Text Analysis","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5386-6862-7","rank":22,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech Computer Science","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233577000","id":38233577000,"full_name":"John Wenskovitch","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Department of Defense","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37071531400","id":37071531400,"full_name":"Lauren Bradel","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech Computer Science","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086544634","id":37086544634,"full_name":"Michelle Dowling","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech Statistics","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38241765600","id":38241765600,"full_name":"Leanna House","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech Computer Science","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37419565900","id":37419565900,"full_name":"Chris North","author_order":5}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Completing text analysis tasks is a continuous sensemaking loop of foraging for information and incrementally synthesizing it into hypotheses. Past research has shown the advantages of using spatial workspaces as a means for synthesizing information through externalizing hypotheses and creating spatial schemas. However, spatializing the entirety of datasets becomes prohibitive as the number of documents available to the analysts grows, particularly when only a small subset are relevant to the task at hand. StarSPIRE is a visual analytics tool designed to explore collections of documents, leveraging users' semantic interactions to steer (1) a synthesis model that aids in document layout, and (2) a foraging model to automatically retrieve new relevant information. In contrast to traditional keyword search foraging (KSF), “semantic interaction foraging” (SIF) occurs as a result of the user's synthesis actions. To quantify the value of semantic interaction foraging, we use StarSPIRE to evaluate its utility for an intelligence analysis sensemaking task. Semantic interaction foraging accounted for 26% of useful documents found, and it also resulted in increased synthesis interactions and improved sensemaking task performance by users in comparison to only using keyword search.","article_number":"8802424","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8802424","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802424/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802424/","publication_title":"2018 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Berlin, Germany","conference_dates":"21-26 Oct. 2018","publication_number":8792226,"is_number":8802370,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"21-26 Oct. 2018","start_page":"13","end_page":"24","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Semantics","Layout","Task analysis","Analytical models","Computational modeling","Data visualization","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Human-centered computing","Visualization","Empirical studies in visualization","Human-centered computing","Visualization","Visual analytics"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6862-7","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6861-0","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2018.8802465","title":"VAST Challenge 2018: Suspense at the Wildlife Preserve","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5386-6862-7","rank":23,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Smith College","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38229914800","id":38229914800,"full_name":"R.

To address this issue, we present a visual analytics approach to explain the primary cause of the wrong predictions introduced by adversarial examples. The key is to analyze the datapaths of the adversarial examples and compare them with those of the normal examples. A datapath is a group of critical neurons and their connections. To this end, we formulate the datapath extraction as a subset selection problem and approximately solve it based on back-propagation. A multi-level visualization consisting of a segmented DAG (layer level), an Euler diagram (feature map level), and a heat map (neuron level), has been designed to help experts investigate datapaths from the high-level layers to the detailed neuron activations. Two case studies are conducted that demonstrate the promise of our approach in support of explaining the working mechanism of adversarial examples.","article_number":"8802509","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8802509","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802509/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802509/","publication_title":"2018 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Berlin, Germany","conference_dates":"21-26 Oct. 2018","publication_number":8792226,"is_number":8802370,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"21-26 Oct. 2018","start_page":"60","end_page":"71","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Neurons","Visual analytics","Tools","Feature extraction","Biological neural networks","Machine learning"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Deep neural networks","robustness","adversarial examples","back propagation","multi-level visualization."]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6862-7","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6861-0","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2018.8802415","title":"Segue: Overviewing Evolution Patterns of Egocentric Networks by Interactive Construction of Spatial Layouts","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5386-6862-7","rank":25,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085886497","id":37085886497,"full_name":"Po-Ming Law","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Visa Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086545509","id":37086545509,"full_name":"Yanhong Wu","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37829310200","id":37829310200,"full_name":"Rahul C.

Existing techniques often require analysts to inspect the evolution patterns of ego-networks one after another. In this study, we explore an approach that allows analysts to interactively create spatial layouts in which each dot is a dynamic ego-network. These spatial layouts provide overviews of the evolution patterns of ego-networks, thereby revealing different global patterns such as trends, clusters and outliers in evolution patterns. To let analysts interactively construct interpretable spatial layouts, we propose a data transformation pipeline, with which analysts can adjust the spatial layouts and convert dynamic ego-networks into event sequences to aid interpretations of the spatial positions. Based on this transformation pipeline, we develop Segue, a visual analysis system that supports thorough exploration of the evolution patterns of ego-networks. Through two usage scenarios, we demonstrate how analysts can gain insights into the overall evolution patterns of a large collection of ego-networks by interactively creating different spatial layouts.","article_number":"8802415","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8802415","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802415/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802415/","publication_title":"2018 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Berlin, Germany","conference_dates":"21-26 Oct. 2018","publication_number":8792226,"is_number":8802370,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"21-26 Oct. 2018","start_page":"72","end_page":"83","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Layout","Pipelines","Data visualization","Visualization","Animation","Task analysis","Social networking (online)"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Human-centered computing","Visualization","Visualization techniques","Graph drawings"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6862-7","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6861-0","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2018.8802383","title":"VUSphere: Visual Analysis of Video Utilization in Online Distance Education","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5386-6862-7","rank":26,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Key Laboratory of Intelligent Networks and Network Security, Ministry of Education, Xi’an Jiaotong University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085494153","id":37085494153,"full_name":"Huan He","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Key Laboratory of Intelligent Networks and Network Security, Ministry of Education, Xi’an Jiaotong University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086945071","id":37086945071,"full_name":"Oinghua Zheng","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"School of Continuing Education, Xi’an Jiaotong University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546247500","id":37546247500,"full_name":"Bo Dong","author_order":3}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Online Distance Education (ODE) provides massive course videos of various specialties for students across the country to learn professional knowledge anytime and anywhere. Analyzing the utilization of these videos from user log data can help academics better understand the learning process of students, evaluate the quality of service provided by regional learning centers, and improve the quality of program curriculum in the future. However, due to the lack of comparable indicators, it is a great challenge to discover the utilization patterns of massive videos and analyze the learning process of large-scale student population from learning log data. In this paper, we introduce a visual analytics system, called VUSphere, to explore the video utilization from multiple perspectives with two proposed indicators. This system offers three coordinated views: a spherical layout overview to depict the overall utilization distribution of videos, courses, and students; a detailed statistics view with four panels to present video utilization statistics of each element from multiple perspectives; and a comparison view to examine the differences in individual elements. Based on the real dataset from our ODE school, several patterns related to video utilization and enrollment are found in the case study with our domain experts.","article_number":"8802383","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8802383","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802383/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802383/","publication_title":"2018 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Berlin, Germany","conference_dates":"21-26 Oct. 2018","publication_number":8792226,"is_number":8802370,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"21-26 Oct. 2018","start_page":"25","end_page":"35","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Education","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Sociology","Statistics","Layout"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Video utilization pattern","online distance education","visual analytics"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6862-7","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6861-0","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2018.8802454","title":"EmbeddingVis: A Visual Analytics Approach to Comparative Network Embedding Inspection","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5386-6862-7","rank":27,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085720737","id":37085720737,"full_name":"Quan Li","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086945915","id":37086945915,"full_name":"Kristanto Sean Njotoprawiro","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086732743","id":37086732743,"full_name":"Hammad Haleem","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"WeChat, Tencent Technology (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086945841","id":37086945841,"full_name":"Qiaoan Chen","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"WeChat, Tencent Technology (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086945693","id":37086945693,"full_name":"Chris Yi","author_order":5},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086496602","id":37086496602,"full_name":"Xiaojuan Ma","author_order":6}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Constructing latent vector representation for nodes in a network through embedding models has shown its practicality in many graph analysis applications, such as node classification, clustering, and link prediction. However, despite the high efficiency and accuracy of learning an embedding model, people have little clue of what information about the original network is preserved in the embedding vectors. The abstractness of low-dimensional vector representation, stochastic nature of the construction process, and non-transparent hyper-parameters all obscure understanding of network embedding results. Visualization techniques have been introduced to facilitate embedding vector inspection, usually by projecting the embedding space to a two-dimensional display. Although the existing visualization methods allow simple examination of the structure of embedding space, they cannot support in-depth exploration of the embedding vectors. In this paper, we design an exploratory visual analytics system that supports the comparative visual interpretation of embedding vectors at the cluster, instance, and structural levels. To be more specific, it facilitates comparison of what and how node metrics are preserved across different embedding models and investigation of relationships between node metrics and selected embedding vectors. Several case studies confirm the efficacy of our system. Experts' feedback suggests that our approach indeed helps them better embrace the understanding of network embedding models.","article_number":"8802454","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8802454","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802454/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802454/","publication_title":"2018 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Berlin, Germany","conference_dates":"21-26 Oct. 2018","publication_number":8792226,"is_number":8802370,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"21-26 Oct. 2018","start_page":"48","end_page":"59","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Measurement","Task analysis","Analytical models","Visual analytics","Stochastic processes","Two dimensional displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Human-centered computing","Visualization","Visualization application domains","Visual analytics","Human-centered computing","Visualization","Visualization design and evaluation methods"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6862-7","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6861-0","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2018.8802410","title":"VAST 2018 Steering Committee","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5386-6862-7","rank":28,"authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Provides a listing of current committee members and society officers.","article_number":"8802410","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8802410","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802410/","publication_title":"2018 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Berlin, Germany","conference_dates":"21-26 Oct. 2018","publication_number":8792226,"is_number":8802370,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"21-26 Oct. 2018","start_page":"i","end_page":"i","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6862-7","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6861-0","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2018.8802371","title":"VAST 2018 Preface","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5386-6862-7","rank":29,"authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Presents the introductory welcome message from the conference proceedings.

In the past year, Augmented Reality (AR) has been introduced in several products of premier technology companies, addressing billions of mobile computing users. In particular, a new breed of AR games is engaging and visually appealing. In contrast, non-entertainment applications of AR generally tend to lack sophisticated content. This can be related to the fact that AR developers are only learning how to effectively use the new medium. But it also has to do with the lack of overlap in AR research and visualization research. While AR research has mostly been driven by computer vision with minimal consideration of the visual output, VIS is the field where the perceptual and cognitive foundations of visual information are studied. AR needs VIS! As AR matures, it will be vital to bring the two fields together. VIS needs to address the new medium AR, embracing its two key aspects: mobility and mixed real+virtual perception. AR poses new challenges for VIS, as the visual information needs to adapt to reality rather than shaping the entire visual domain. This talk will discuss fundamental properties of AR visualization and present examples of previous, current and future work.","article_number":"8802427","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8802427","publication_title":"2018 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Berlin, Germany","conference_dates":"21-26 Oct. 2018","publication_number":8792226,"is_number":8802370,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"21-26 Oct. 2018","start_page":"1","end_page":"1","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6862-7","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6861-0","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2018.8802404","title":"[Copyright notice]","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5386-6862-7","rank":36,"authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Presents the copyright information for the conference.

Sophisticated algorithmic techniques seek to identify and visualize non-accidental patterns that may be (causally) linked to mechanisms in the natural sciences, but also in the social sciences, medicine, technology, and governance. When we use machine learning algorithms to inspect the often high-dimensional, uncertain, and high-volume data to filter out and visualize relevant information, we aim to abstract from accidental factors in our experiments and thereby generalize over data fluctuations. Doing this, we often rely on highly nonlinear algorithms. This talk presents arguments advocating an information theoretic framework for algorithm analysis, where an algorithm is characterized as a computational evolution of a posterior distribution on the output space with a quantitative stopping criterion. The method allows us to investigate complex data analysis pipelines, such as those found in computational neuroscience, neurology, and molecular biology. I will demonstrate this concept for the validation of algorithms using the example of a statistical analysis of diffusion tensor imaging data. In addition, on the example of gene expression data, I will demonstrate how different spectral clustering methods can be validated by showing their robustness to data fluctuations and yet sufficient sensitivity to changes in the data. All in all, an information-theoretical method is presented for validating data analysis algorithms, offering the potential of more trustful results in Visual Analytics.","article_number":"8802482","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8802482","publication_title":"2018 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Berlin, Germany","conference_dates":"21-26 Oct. 2018","publication_number":8792226,"is_number":8802370,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"21-26 Oct. 2018","start_page":"1","end_page":"1","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6862-7","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6861-0","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}}]}
