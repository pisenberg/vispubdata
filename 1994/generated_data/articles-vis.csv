"Visualization techniques are applied to an electric power system transmission network to create a graphical picture of network power flows and voltages. A geographic data map is used. Apparent power flow is encoded as the width of an arrow, with direction from real power flow. Flows are superposed on flow limits. Contour plots and color coding failed for representing bus voltages. A two-color thermometer encoding worked well. The resulting visualization is a significant improvement over current user interface practice in the power industry.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346292/","LOCKED","346292","Dept. of Electr.

"3D ultrasound is one of the most interesting non-invasive, non-radiative tomographic techniques. Rendering 3D models from such data is not straightforward due to the noisy, fuzzy nature of ultrasound imaging containing a lot of artefacts. We first apply speckle, median and gaussian prefiltering to improve the image quality. Using several semi-automatic segmentation tools we isolate interesting features within a few minutes. Our improved surface-extraction procedure enables volume rendering of high quality within a few seconds on a normal workstation, thus making the complete system suitable for routine clinical applications.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346294/","LOCKED","346294","Fraunhofer-Inst. for Comput.

"In the process of archaeological excavation, a vast amount of data, much of it three-dimensional in nature, is recorded. In recent years, computer graphics techniques have been applied to the task of visualizing such data. In particular, data visualization has been used to accomplish the virtual reconstruction of site architecture and to enable the display of spatial data distributions using three-dimensional models of site terrain. In the case we present here, these two approaches are integrated in the modeling of a prehistoric pithouse. In order to better visualize artifact distributions in the context of site architecture, surface data is displayed as a layer in a virtual reconstruction viewable at interactive rates. This integration of data display with the architectural model has proven valuable in identifying correlations between distributions of different artifact categories and their spatial proximity to significant architectural features.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346296/","LOCKED","346296","Sch. of Comput.

"A high-performance algorithm for generating isosurfaces is presented. In this algorithm, extrema points in a scalar field are first extracted. A graph is then generated in which the extrema points are taken as nodes. Each arc of the graph has a list of IDs of the cells that are intersected by the arc. A boundary cell list ordered according to cells' values is also generated. The graph and the list generated in this pre-process are used as a guide in searching for seed cells. Isosurfaces are generated from seed cells that are found in arcs of the graph. In this process, isosurfaces appear to propagate themselves. The algorithm visits only cells that are intersected by an isosurface and cells whose IDs an included in cell lists. It is especially efficient when many isosurfaces are interactively generated in a huge volume. Some benchmark tests described show the efficiency of the algorithm.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346334/","LOCKED","346334","Res.

"The ordinarily arid climate of coastal Peru is disturbed every few years by a phenomenon called El Nino, characterized by a warming in the Pacific Ocean. Severe rainstorms are one of the consequences of El Nino, which cause great damage. An examination of daily data from 66 rainfall stations in the Chiura-Piura region of northwestern Peru from late 1982 through mid-1983 (associated with an El Nino episode) yields information on the mesoscale structure of these storms. These observational data are typical of a class that are scattered at irregular locations in two dimensions. The use of continuous realization techniques for qualitative visualization (e.g., surface deformation or contouring) requires an intermediate step to define a topological relationship between the locations of data to form a mesh structure. Several common methods are considered, and the results of their application to the study of the rainfall events are analyzed.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346298/","LOCKED","346298","IBM Thomas J.

"One of the most fundamental issues in magnetic fusion research is the understanding of turbulent transport observed in present-day tokamak experiments. Plasma turbulence is very challenging from a theoretical point of view due to the nonlinearity and high dimensionality of the governing equations. Recent developments in algorithms along with the astounding advances in high performance computing now make first-principle particle simulations an important tool for improved understanding of such phenomena. Due to the five dimensional phase space (3 spatial, 2 velocity) and complex toroidal geometry, visualization is crucial for interpreting such simulation data. This paper discusses how visualization tools are currently used and what new physics has been elucidated, along with what can be learned about tokamak turbulence through the interplay between theory, simulation and visualization.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346301/","LOCKED","346301","Plasma Phys.

"We consider the problem of approximating a smooth surface f(x, y), based on n scattered samples {(x/sub i/, y/sub i/, z/sub i/)/sub i=1//sup n/} where the sample values {z/sub i/} are contaminated with noise: z/sub i/=f(x/sub i/, y/sub i/)=/spl epsiv//sub i/. We present an algorithm that generates a PLS (piecewise linear surface) f', defined on a triangulation of the sample locations V={(x/sub i/, y/sub i/)/sub i=1//sup n/}, approximating f well. Constructing the PLS involves specifying both the triangulation of V and the values of f' at the points of V. We demonstrate that even when the sampling process is not noisy, a better approximation for f is obtained using our algorithm, compared to existing methods. This algorithm is useful for DTM (digital terrain map) manipulation by polygon-based graphics engines for visualization applications.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346336/","LOCKED","346336","Dept. of Electr.

"The purpose of the article is the consideration of the problem of ambiguity over the faces arising in the Marching Cube algorithm. The article shows that for unambiguous choice of the sequence of the points of intersection of the isosurface with edges confining the face it is sufficient to sort them along one of the coordinates. It also presents the solution of this problem inside the cube. Graph theory methods are used to approximate the isosurface inside the cell.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346307/","LOCKED","346307","Dept. of Comput.

"Pseudocoloring is a frequently used technique in scientific visualization for mapping a color to a data value. When using pseudocolor and animation to visualize data that contain missing regions displayed as black or transparent, the missing regions popping in and out can distract the viewer from the more relevant information. Filling these gaps with interpolated data could lead to a misinterpretation of the data. The paper presents a method for combining pseudocoloring and grayscale in the same colormap. Valid data are mapped to colors in the colormap. The luminance values of the colors bounding areas of missing data are used in interpolating over these regions. The missing data are mapped to the grayscale portion of the colormap. This approach has the advantages of eliminating distracting gaps caused by missing data and distinguishing between those areas that represent valid data and those areas that do not. This approach was inspired by a technique used in the restoration of paintings.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346317/","LOCKED","346317","Hughes STX Corp., NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37659258900","1","R.

"The recent advent of computer graphics techniques has helped to bridge the gap between architectural concepts and actual buildings. Closing this gap is especially critical in healthcare facilities. We present new techniques to support the design decision process and apply them to the design of a neonatal intensive care unit. Two issues are addressed: ergonometric accessibility and visual supervision of spaces. These two issues can be investigated utilizing new technologies that demonstrate that computers are more then a medium of communication in the field of architecture; the computer can make a significant contribution as a proactive design tool.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346293/","LOCKED","346293","Visualization Lab., Texas A&M Univ., College Station, TX, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37376744200","1","T.

"Augmented reality systems with see-through headmounted displays have been used primarily for applications that are possible with today's computational capabilities. We explore possibilities for a particular application-in-place, real-time 3D ultrasound visualization-without concern for such limitations. The question is not ""How well could we currently visualize the fetus in real time,"" but ""How well could we see the fetus if we had sufficient compute power?"" Our video sequence shows a 3D fetus within a pregnant woman's abdomen-the way this would look to a HMD user. Technical problems in making the sequence are discussed.

"This paper presents a technique for performing volume morphing between two volumetric datasets in the wavelet domain. The idea is to decompose the volumetric datasets into a set of frequency bands, apply smooth interpolation to each band, and reconstruct to form the morphed model. In addition, a technique for establishing a suitable correspondence among object voxels is presented. The combination of these two techniques results in a smooth transition between the two datasets and produces morphed volume with fewer high frequency distortions than those obtained from spatial domain volume morphing.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346333/","LOCKED","346333","Dept. of Comput.

Based on the popular AVS package, SAVS presents the user with an environment tailored specifically for the physical scientist. Thus there is minimal ""startup"" time, and the scientist can immediately concentrate on his science problem.

"Addresses the needs and requirements of integrating visualization and geographic information system technologies. There are three levels of integration methods: rudimentary, operational and functional. The rudimentary approach uses the minimum amount of data sharing and exchange between these two technologies. The operational level attempts to provide consistency of the data while removing redundancies between the two technologies. The functional form attempts to provide transparent communication between these respective software environments. At this level, the user only needs to request information and the integrated system retrieves or generates the information depending upon the request. This paper examines the role and impact of these three levels of integration. Stepping further into the future, the paper also questions the long-term survival of these separate disciplines.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346284/","LOCKED","346284","Martin Marietta/US EPA Visualization Center, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282569700","1","T.M.

"Ash clouds resulting from volcanic eruptions are a serious hazard to aviation safety. In Alaska alone, there are over 40 active volcanoes whose eruptions may affect more than 40,000 flights using the great circle polar routes each year. The clouds are especially problematic because they are invisible to radar and nearly impossible to distinguish from weather clouds. The Arctic Region Supercomputing Center and the Alaska Volcano Observatory have collaborated to develop a system for predicting and visualizing the movement of volcanic ash clouds when an eruption occurs. The output from the model is combined with a digital elevation model to produce a realistic view of the ash cloud which may be examined interactively from any desired point of view at any time during the prediction period. This paper describes the visualization techniques employed in the system and includes a video animation of the 1989 Mount Redoubt eruption which caused complete engine failure on a 747 passenger jet.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346290/","LOCKED","346290","Arctic Region Supercomput.

"We study the topology of symmetric, second-order tensor fields. The goal is to represent their complex structure by a simple set of carefully chosen points and lines analogous to vector field topology. We extract topological skeletons of the eigenvector fields, and we track their evolution over time. We study tensor topological transitions and correlate tensor and vector data. The basic constituents of tensor topology are the degenerate points, or points where eigenvalues are equal to each other. Degenerate points play a similar role as critical points in vector fields. We identify two kinds of elementary degenerate points, which we call wedges and trisectors. They can combine to form more familiar singularities-such as saddles, nodes, centers, or foci. However, these are generally unstable structures in tensor fields. Finally, we show a topological rule that puts a constraint on the topology of tensor fields defined across surfaces, extending to tensor fields the Poincare-Hopf theorem for vector fields.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346326/","LOCKED","346326","Dept. of Appl.

"Flow fields, geodesics, and deformed volumes are natural sources of families of space curves that can be characterized by intrinsic geometric properties such as curvature, torsion, and Frenet frames. By expressing a curve's moving Frenet coordinate frame as an equivalent unit quaternion, we reduce the number of components that must be displayed from nine with six constraints to four with one constraint. We can then assign a color to each curve point by dotting its quaternion frame with a 4D light vector, or we can plot the frame values separately as a curve in the three-sphere. As examples, we examine twisted volumes used in topology to construct knots and tangles, a spherical volume deformation known as the Dirac string trick, and streamlines of 3D vector flow fields.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346330/","LOCKED","346330","Dept. of Comput.

"Air flowing around the wing tips of an airplane forms horizontal tornado-like vortices that can be dangerous to following aircraft. The dynamics of such vortices, including ground and atmospheric effects, can be predicted by numerical simulation, allowing the safety and capacity of airports to be improved. We introduce three-dimensional techniques for visualizing time-dependent, two-dimensional wake vortex computations, and the hazard strength of such vortices near the ground. We describe a vortex core tracing algorithm and a local tiling method to visualize the vortex evolution. The tiling method converts time-dependent, two-dimensional vortex cores into three-dimensional vortex tubes. Finally, a novel approach is used to calculate the induced rolling moment on the following airplane at each grid point within a region near the vortex tubes and thus allows three-dimensional visualization of the hazard strength of the vortices.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346328/","LOCKED","346328","Inst. for Comput.

"An important issue in scientific visualization systems is the management of data sets. Most data sets in scientific visualization, whether created by measurement or simulation, are usually voluminous. The goal of data management is to reduce the storage space and the access time of these data sets to speed up the visualization process. A new progressive transmission scheme using spline biorthogonal wavelet bases is proposed in this paper. By exploiting the properties of this set of wavelet bases, a fast algorithm involving only additions and subtractions is developed. Due to the multiresolutional nature of the wavelet transform, this scheme is compatible with hierarchical-structured rendering algorithms. The formula for reconstructing the functional values in a continuous volume space is given in a simple polynomial form. Lossless compression is possible, even when using floating-point numbers. This algorithm has been applied to data from a global ocean model. The lossless compression ratio is about 1.5:1. With a compression ratio of 50:1, the reconstructed data is still of good quality. Several other wavelet bases are compared with the spline biorthogonal wavelet bases. Finally the reconstructed data is visualized using various algorithms and the results are demonstrated.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346332/","LOCKED","346332","NSF Eng. Res.

"This paper presents an object-oriented system design supporting the composition of scientific data visualization techniques based on the definition of hierarchies of typed data objects and tools. Traditional visualization systems focus on creating graphical objects which often cannot be re-used for further processing. Our approach provides objects of different topological dimension to offer a natural way of describing the results of visualization mappings. Serial composition of data extraction tools is allowed, while each intermediate visualization object shares a common description and behavior. Visualization objects can be re-used, facilitating the data exploration process by expanding the available analysis and correlation functions provided. This design offers an open-ended architecture for the development of new visualization techniques. It promotes data and software re-use, eliminates the need for writing special purpose software and reduces processing requirements during interactive visualization sessions.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346303/","LOCKED","346303","Dept. of Electr.

"Time-dependent (unsteady) flow fields are commonly generated in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations; however, there are very few flow visualization systems that generate particle traces in unsteady flow fields. Most existing systems generate particle traces in time-independent flow fields. A particle tracing system has been developed to generate particle traces in unsteady flow fields. The system was used to visualize several 3D unsteady flow fields from real-world problems, and it has provided useful insights into the time-varying phenomena in the flow fields.

"Line integral convolution (LIC), introduced by B. Cabral and C. Leedom (1993), is a powerful technique for imaging and animating vector fields. We extend the LIC paradigm in three ways: the existing technique is limited to vector fields over a regular Cartesian grid and we extend it to vector fields over parametric surfaces, specifically those found in curvilinear grids, used in computational fluid dynamics simulations; periodic motion filters can be used to animate the flow visualization, but when the flow lies on a parametric surface, the motion appears misleading, and we explain why this problem arises and show how to adjust the LIC algorithm to handle it; we introduce a technique to visualize vector magnitude as well as vector direction, which is based on varying the frequency of the filter function and we develop a different technique based on kernel phase shifts which we have found to show substantially better results. Implementation of these algorithms utilizes texture-mapping hardware to run in real time, which allows them to be included in interactive applications.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346313/","LOCKED","346313","Comput.

"We present a direct volume rendering algorithm to speed up volume animation for flow visualizations. Data coherency between consecutive simulation time steps is used to avoid casting rays from those pixels retaining color values assigned to the previous image. The algorithm calculates the differential information among a sequence of 3D volumetric simulation data. At each time step the differential information is used to compute the locations of pixels that need updating and a ray-casting method as utilized to produce the updated image. We illustrate the utility and speed of the differential volume rendering algorithm with simulation data from computational bioelectric and fluid dynamics applications. We can achieve considerable disk-space savings and nearly real-time rendering of 3D flows using low-cost, single processor workstations for models which contain hundreds of thousands of data points.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346321/","LOCKED","346321","Dept. of Comput.

"A discussion is given on the validation, verification and evaluation of scientific visualization software. A ""bug"" usually refers to software doing something different than the programmer intended. Comprehensive testing, especially for software intended for use in innovative environments, is hard. Descriptions and summaries of the tests we have done are often not available to the users. A different source of visualization errors is software that does something different than what the scientist thinks it does. The particular methods used to compute values in the process of creating visualizations are important to the scientists, but vendors are understandably reluctant to reveal all the internals of their products. Is there a workable compromise? Another vulnerability of visualization users is in the choice of a technique which is less effective than others equally available. Visualization researchers and developers should give users the information required to make good decisions about competing visualization techniques. What information is needed? What will it take to gather and distribute it? How should it be tied to visualization software?.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346285/","LOCKED","346285","NASA Ames Res.

"A new algorithm for identifying vortices in complex flows is presented. The scheme uses both the vorticity and pressure fields. A skeleton line along the center of a vortex is produced by a two-step predictor-corrector scheme. The technique uses the vector field to move in the direction of the skeleton line and the scalar field to correct the location in the plane perpendicular to the skeleton line. With an economical description of the vortex tube's cross-section, the skeleton compresses the representation of the flow by a factor of 4000 or more. We show how the reconstructed geometry of vortex tubes can be enhanced to help visualize helical motion.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346327/","LOCKED","346327","Inst. for Comput.

"To render images from a three-dimensional array of sample values, it is necessary to interpolate between the samples. This paper is concerned with interpolation methods that are equivalent to convolving the samples with a reconstruction filter; this covers all commonly used schemes, including trilinear and cubic interpolation. We first outline the formal basis of interpolation in three-dimensional signal processing theory. We then propose numerical metrics that can be used to measure filter characteristics that are relevant to the appearance of images generated using that filter. We apply those metrics to several previously used filters and relate the results to isosurface images of the interpolations. We show that the choice of interpolation scheme can have a dramatic effect on image quality, and we discuss the cost/benefit tradeoff inherent in choosing a filter.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346331/","LOCKED","346331","Program of Comput.

"In computational fluid dynamics visualization is a frequently used tool for data evaluation, understanding of flow characteristics, and qualitative comparison to flow visualizations originating from experiments. Building on an existing visualization software system, that allows for a careful selection of state-of-the-art visualization techniques and some extensions, it became possible to present various features of the data in a single image. The visualizations show vortex position and rotation as well as skin-friction lines, experimental oil-flow traces, and shock-wave positions. By adding experimental flow visualization a comparison between numerical simulation and wind-tunnel flow becomes possible up to a high level of detail. Since some of the underlying algorithms are not yet described in detail in the visualization literature, some experiences gained from the implementation are illustrated.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346329/","LOCKED","346329","DLR, German Aerosp.

"We present a comprehensive algorithm to construct a topologically correct triangulation of the real affine part of a rational parametric surface with few restrictions on the defining rational functions. The rational functions are allowed to be undefined on domain curves (pole curves) and at certain special points (base points), and the surface is allowed to have nodal or cuspidal self-intersections. We also recognize that for a complete display, some real points on the parametric surface may be generated only by complex parameter values, and that some finite points on the surface may be generated only by infinite parameter values; we show how to compensate for these conditions. Our techniques for handling these problems have applications in scientific visualization, rendering non-standard NURBS, and in finite-element mesh generation.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346335/","LOCKED","346335","Dept. of Comput.

"Much of the attention in visualization research has focussed on data rooted in physical phenomena, which is generally limited to three or four dimensions. However, many sources of data do not share this dimensional restriction. A critical problem in the analysis of such data is providing researchers with tools to gain insights into characteristics of the data, such as anomalies and patterns. Several visualization methods have been developed to address this problem, and each has its strengths and weaknesses. This paper describes a system named XmdvTool which integrates several of the most common methods for projecting multivariate data onto a two-dimensional screen. This integration allows users to explore their data in a variety of formats with ease. A view enhancement mechanism called an N-dimensional brush is also described. The brush allows users to gain insights into spatial relationships over N dimensions by highlighting data which falls within a user-specified subspace.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346302/","LOCKED","346302","Dept. of Comput.

"We present a new technique for the visualization and analysis of the results from Monte Carlo simulations based on /spl alpha/-complexes and /spl alpha/-shapes. The specific application presented is the analysis of the quantum-mechanical behavior of hydrogen molecules and helium atoms on a surface at very low temperatures. The technique is an improvement over existing techniques in two respects. First, the approach allows one to visualize the points on a random walk at varying levels of detail and interactively select the level of detail that is most appropriate. Second, using /spl alpha/-shapes one can obtain quantitative measures of spatial properties of the system, such as the boundary length and interior area of clusters, that would be difficult to obtain otherwise.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346337/","LOCKED","346337","Dept. of Comput.

"This paper presents a parallel ray-casting volume rendering algorithm and its implementation on the massively parallel IBM SP-1 computer using the Chameleon message passing library. Though this algorithm takes advantage of many of the unique features of the SP-1 (e.g. high-speed switch, large memory per node, high-speed disk array, HIPPI display, et al.), the use of Chameleon allows the code to be executed on any collection of workstations. The algorithm is image-ordered and distributes the data and the computational load to individual processors. After the volume data is distributed, all processors then perform local ray tracing of their respective subvolumes concurrently. No interprocess communication takes place during the ray tracing process. After a subimage is generated by each processor, the final image is obtained by composing subimages between all the processors. The program itself is implemented as an interactive process through a GUI residing on a graphics workstation which is coupled to the parallel rendering algorithm via sockets. The paper highlights the Chameleon implementation, the GUI, some optimization improvements, static load balancing, and direct parallel display to a HIPPI framebuffer.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346341/","LOCKED","346341","Div. of Math. & Comput.

"In order to develop a foundation for visualization, we develop lattice models for data objects and displays that focus on the fact that data objects are approximations to mathematical objects and real displays are approximations to ideal displays. These lattice models give us a way to quantize the information content of data and displays and to define conditions on the visualization mappings from data to displays. Mappings satisfy these conditions if and only if they are lattice isomorphisms. We show how to apply this result to scientific data and display models, and discuss how it might be applied to recursively defined data types appropriate for complex information processing.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346304/","LOCKED","346304","Space Sci. & Eng.

"Swept surfaces and volumes are generated by moving a geometric model through space. Swept surfaces and volumes are important in many computer-aided design applications including geometric modeling, numerical cutter path generation, and spatial path planning. In this paper we describe a numerical algorithm to generate swept surfaces and volumes using implicit modeling techniques. The algorithm is applicable to any geometric representation for which a distance function can be computed. The algorithm also treats degenerate trajectories such as self-intersection and surface singularity. We show applications of this algorithm to maintainability design and robot path planning.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346339/","LOCKED","346339","Gen. Electr. Corp. Res. & Dev.

"Surface-based rendering techniques, particularly those that extract a polygonal approximation of an isosurface, are widely used in volume visualization. As dataset size increases though, the computational demands of these methods can overwhelm typically available computing resources. Recent work on accelerating such techniques has focused on preprocessing the volume data or postprocessing the extracted polygonization. The algorithm presented, concentrates instead on streamlining the surface extraction process itself so as to accelerate the rendering of large volumes. The technique shortens the conventional isosurface visualization pipeline by eliminating the intermediate polygonization. We compute the contribution of the isosurface within a volume cell to the resulting image directly from a simplified numerical description of the cell/surface intersection. The approach also reduces the work in the remaining stages of the visualization process. By quantizing the volume data, we exploit precomputed and cached data at key processing steps to improve rendering efficiency. The resulting implementation provides comparatively fast renderings with reasonable image quality.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346306/","LOCKED","346306","Program of Comput.

"Cortex has been designed for interactive analysis and display of simulation data generated by CFD applications based on unstructured-grid solvers. Unlike post-processing visualization environments, Cortex is designed to work in co-processing mode with the CFD application. This significantly reduces data storage and data movement requirements for visualization and also allows users to interactively steer the application. Further, Cortex supports high-performance by running on massively parallel computers and workstation clusters. An important goal for Cortex, is to provide visualization to a variety of solvers which differ in their solution methodologies and supported flow models. Coupled with the co-processing requirement, this has required the development of a well defined programming interface to the CFD solver that lets the visualization system communicate efficiently with the solver, and requires minimal programming effort for porting to new solvers. Further, the requirement for targeting multiple solvers and application niches demands that the visualization system be rapidly and easily modifiable. Such flexibility is attained in Cortex by using the high-level, interpreted language Scheme for implementing user-interfaces and high-level visualization functions. By making the Scheme interpreter available from the Cortex text interface, the user can also customize and extend the visualization system.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346310/","LOCKED","346310","Fluent Inc., Lebanon, NH, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37653860300","1","D.

"Since the introduction of standard techniques for isosurface extraction from volumetric datasets, one of the hardest problems has been to reduce the number of triangles (or polygons) generated. The paper presents an algorithm that considerably reduces the number of polygons generated by a Marching Cubes-like scheme (W. Lorensen and H. Cline, 1987) without excessively increasing the overall computational complexity. The algorithm assumes discretization of the dataset space and replaces cell edge interpolation by midpoint selection. Under these assumptions, the extracted surfaces are composed of polygons lying within a finite number of incidences, thus allowing simple merging of the output facets into large coplanar polygons. An experimental evaluation of the proposed approach on datasets related to biomedical imaging and chemical modelling is reported.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346308/","LOCKED","346308","CNR, Pisa, Italy","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37265786500","1","C.

"Vector field rendering is difficult in 3D because the vector icons overlap and hide each other. We propose four different techniques for visualizing vector fields only near surfaces. The first uses motion blurred particles in a thickened region around the surface. The second uses a voxel grid to contain integral curves of the vector field. The third uses many antialiased lines through the surface, and the fourth uses hairs sprouting from the surface and then bending in the direction of the vector field. All the methods use the graphics pipeline, allowing real time rotation and interaction, and the first two methods can animate the texture to move in the flow determined by the velocity field.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346312/","LOCKED","346312","Lawrence Livermore Nat.

One new approach uses realistic volumetric gas rendering techniques to produce photo-realistic images and animations from scalar CFD data. The second uses ray casting that is based an a sampler illumination model and is mainly centered around a versatile new tool for the design of transfer functions. The third method employs a simple illumination model and rapid rendering mechanisms to provide efficient preview capabilities. These tools provide a large range of volume rendering capabilities to be used by the CFD explorer to render rapidly for navigation through the data, to emphasize data features (e.g., shock waves) with a specific transfer function, or to present a realistic rendition of the model.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346314/","LOCKED","346314","Dept. of Comput.

"Meaningful scientific visualizations benefit the interpretation of scientific data, concepts and processes. To ensure meaningful visualizations, the visualization system needs to adapt to desires, disabilities and abilities of the user, interpretation aim, resources (hardware, software) available, and the form and content of the data to be visualized. We suggest describing these characteristics with four models: user model, problem domain/task model, resource model and data model. The paper makes suggestions for the generation of a user model as a basis for an adaptive visualization system. We propose to extract information about the user by involving the user in interactive computer tests and games. Relevant abilities tested are color perception, color memory, color ranking, mental rotation, and fine motor coordination.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346316/","LOCKED","346316","Paderborn Univ., Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37353973100","1","G.O.

These tools often present only static structure, or they present dynamics from only a few of the many layers of a program and its underlying system. This paper introduces ""PV"", a prototype program visualization system which provides concurrent visual presentation of behavior from all layers, including: the program itself, user-level libraries, the operating system, and the hardware, as this behavior unfolds over time. PV juxtaposes views from different layers in order to facilitate visual correlation, and allows these views to be navigated in a coordinated fashion. This results in an extremely powerful mechanism for exploring application behavior. Experience is presented from actual use of PV in production settings with programmers facing real deadlines and serious performance problems.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346322/","LOCKED","346322","IBM Thomas J.

"We describe the theoretical and practical visualization issues solved in the implementation of an interactive real-time four-dimensional geometry interface for the CAVE, an immersive virtual reality environment. While our specific task is to produce a ""virtual geometry"" experience by approximating physically correct rendering of manifolds embedded in four dimensions, the general principles exploited by our approach reflect requirements common to many immersive virtual reality applications, especially those involving volume rendering. Among the issues we address are the classification of rendering tasks, the specialized hardware support required to attain interactivity, specific techniques required to render 4D objects, and interactive methods appropriate for our 4D virtual world application.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346324/","LOCKED","346324","Dept. of Comput.
