"Experiences during the investigation of parallel methods for faster isosurface generation on SIMD (single instruction stream, multiple data stream) machines are described. A sequential version of a well-known isosurfacing algorithm is algorithmically enhanced for a particular type of SIMD architecture. The SIMD implementation takes full advantage of the data parallel nature of the algorithm, and experiments have proven the implementation to be highly scalable. A parallel tool, which can generate 170 K polygons/s, gives scientists the means to explore large 3D scalar or vector fields interactively.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/235223/","LOCKED","235223","Los Alamos Nat.

"Methods are presented for the visualization of fuzzy data based on the sensitivity of the human visual system to motion and dynamic changes, and the ease of which electronic display devices can change their display. The methods include taking an otherwise static image and displaying in an animation loop either its segmented components or a series of blurred versions of the whole image. This approach was applied to sea-surface temperature data and was found to be effective in showing fuzzy details embedded in the data, and in drawing the viewer's attention. This approach and these methods could play a significant role in the display of browse products for massive data and information systems.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/235199/","LOCKED","235199","Mitre Corp., McLean, VA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37352200300","1","N.D.

"A method is presented to obtain a unique shape description of an object by using wavelet transforms. Wavelet transform is a signal analysis technique which decomposes a signal using a family of functions having a local property in both time and frequency domains. A multiresolution expression of 3D volume data was first obtained by applying 3D orthogonal wavelet transforms, with the shape then being approximated with a relatively small number of 3D orthogonal functions using only the significant functions. In addition, the resolution of the approximation can be varied point by point using the local property of the wavelets. The method is applied to real volume data, i.e. facial range data and MR images of a human head, and typical results are shown.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/235230/","LOCKED","235230","Image Understanding Section, Electrotech.

"Techniques that manipulate logical time in order to produce coherent animations of parallel program behavior despite the presence of asynchrony are presented. The techniques interpret program behavior in light of user-defined abstractions and generate animations based on a logical, rather than a physical, view of time. If this interpretation succeeds, the resulting animation is easily understood. If it fails, the programmer can be assured that the failure was not an artifact of the visualization.

"A technique for defining graphical depictions for all the data types defined in an algorithm is presented. The ability to display arbitrary combinations of an algorithm's data objects in a common frame of reference, coupled with interactive control of algorithm execution, provides a powerful way to understand algorithm behavior. Type definitions are constrained so that all primitive values occurring in data objects are assigned scalar types. A graphical display, including user interaction with the display, is modeled by a special data type. Mappings from the scalar types into the display model type provide a simple user interface for controlling how all data types are depicted, without the need for type-specific graphics logic.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/235215/","LOCKED","235215","Wisconsin Univ., Madison, WI, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37352189500","1","W.

"An algorithm that attempts to improve a triangulation by shifting the vertices so that curvature within the triangles is nearly equal is presented. Unnecessary triangles are removed. The method is an effective way of guaranteeing that the triangle vertices are points of higher curvature, and that the triangle edges correspond to distinctive edges on the surfaces. Triangulations of surfaces with constant curvature-and hence no distinctive features-will gain nothing from this or any other optimization algorithm. As demonstrated by the results, the techinque of moving triangle vertices can improve some triangulation models. Greatest improvements occur with surfaces characterized by sharp edges, such as the pyramid and ridge models. Less improvement occurs on models that already approximate the surface topology and/or have less distinctive features.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/235191/","LOCKED","235191","Grumman Data Systems, Woodbury, NY, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37378511100","1","L.L.

"A methodology has been developed for constructing streamlines and particle paths in numerically generated fluid velocity fields. A graphical technique is used to convert the discretely defined flow within a cell into one represented by two three-dimensional stream functions. Streamlines are calculated by tracking constant values of each stream function, a process which corresponds to finding the intersection of two stream surfaces. The tracking process is mass conservative and does not use a time stepping method for integration, thus eliminating a computationally intensive part of traditional tracking algorithms. The method can be applied generally to any three-dimensional compressible or incompressible steady flow. Results presented compare the performance of the new method to the most commonly used scheme and show that calculation times can be reduced by an order of magnitude.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/235225/","LOCKED","235225","Dept. of Mech.

It is shown that it is possible to generate truly interactive terrain rendering and volume visualization by computing images in real-time, at multiple frames/second.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/235189/","LOCKED","235189","David Sarnoff Res.

"The visualization of 3-D second-order tensor fields and matrix data is studied. The general problem of visualizing unsymmetric real or complex Hermitian second-order tensor fields can be reduced to the simultaneous visualization of a real and symmetric second-order tensor field and a real vector field. The emphasis is on exploiting the mathematical properties of tensor fields in order to facilitate their visualization and to produce a continuous representation of the data. The focus is on interactively sensing and exploring real and symmetric second-order tensor data by generalizing the vector notion of streamline to the tensor concept of hyperstreamline. The importance of a structural analysis of the data field analogous to the techniques of vector field topology extraction in order to obtain a unique and objective representation of second-order tensor fields is stressed.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/235193/","LOCKED","235193","Stanford Univ., CA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37062829700","1","T.

"A technique is given for computer visualization of simultaneous three-dimensional vector and scalar fields such as velocity and temperature in reacting fluid flow fields. The technique, which is called Virtual Smoke, simulates the use of colored smoke for experimental gaseous fluid flow visualization. However, it is noninvasive and can animate, in particular, the dynamic behaviors of steady-state or instantaneous flow fields obtained from numerical simulations. Virtual Smoke is based on volume seeds and volume seedlings, which are direct volume visualization methods previously developed for highly interactive scalar volume data exploration.

"A technique is given allowing interactive visualization of large, scalar, discrete volume fields as semitransparent clouds 'on the fly', i.e. without preprocessing. Interactivity is not restricted to geometric transformations, but includes all possible methods of processing the data. The system flexibly trades-off quality for performance at any desirable level. In particular, by using a scanline based method and a DDA-based traversing scheme instead of ray-tracing one achieves real-time processing during previewing. By means of the 'pyramidal volume' traversing technique, one achieves high-quality, constant-time filtering, independent of the data resolution. Several filters help to detect 'fuzzy', obscured hot spots, even within noisy data. The visualization pipeline allows the application of filters at four different stages, maximizing their flexibility. Four different illumination models have been implemented.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/235229/","LOCKED","235229","Tech.

"Interactive visualization systems provide a powerful means to explore complex data, especially when coupled with 3-D interaction and display devices to produce virtual worlds. While designing a quality static 2-D visualization is already a difficult task for most users, designing an interactive 3-D one is even more challenging. To address this problem, AutoVisual, a research system that designs interactive virtual worlds for visualizing and exploring multivariate relations of arbitrary arity, is being developed. AutoVisual uses worlds within worlds, an interactive visualization technique that exploits nested, heterogeneous coordinate systems to map multiple variables onto each spatial dimension. AutoVisual's designs are guided by user-specified visualization tasks, and by a catalog of design principles encoded using a rule-based language.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/235197/","LOCKED","235197","Dept. of Comput.

"A visual interface for a multimedia database management system (MDBMS) is described. DBMS query languages are linear in syntax. Although natural language interfaces have been found to be useful, natural language is ambiguous and difficult to process. For queries on standard (relational) data, these difficulties can be avoided with the use of a visual, graphical interface to guide the user in specifying the query. For image and other media data which are ambiguous in nature, natural language processing, combined with direct graphical access to the domain knowledge, is used to interpret and evaluate the natural language query. The system fully supports graphical and image input/output in different formats. The combination of visual effect and natural language specification, the support of media data, and the allowance of incremental query specification simplify the process of query specification not only for image or multimedia databases but also for all databases.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/235208/","LOCKED","235208","Inst. fuer Inf., Munchen Univ., Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","1","D.A.

"A fast range search algorithm for visualizing extrema of d-dimensional volume data in real time as the user interactively moves the query range is presented. The algorithm is based on an efficient data structure, called index heap, which needs only O(N/log N) space and O(d2/sup d/N) preprocessing time to be set up, where N is the size of the d-dimensional data volume. The algorithm can answer an extremum query in O(4/sup d/) expected time, and its worst-case time complexity is O(2/sup d/ log N) per query. For dimensions two and three, the range search for extrema is effected in average O(1) time per query independently of the size of query range.

The lower level is a volume model with a set of semantic attributes belonging to each voxel. Its spatial representation is derived from data sets of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computer tomography. The semantic attributes are assigned by an anatomist using a volume editor. The upper level is a set of relations between these attributes which are also specified by the expert. Interactive visualization tools, such as multiple surface display, transparent rendering, and cutting, are provided. It is shown that the combination of this object-oriented data structure with advanced volume visualization tools provides the look and feel of a real dissection.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/235218/","LOCKED","235218","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37378529100","1","K.H.

"Discusses issues relating to the complexity of scientific visualization software system implementation. It is argued that the complexity of current implementations of such systems may limit the utility for users because the interfaces typically require significant knowledge of the data being studied and the applicable visualization algorithms, as well as its infrastructure of graphics, imaging and data handling technology. The issues, unknowns, and possible solutions associated with building effective scientific visualization software are discussed.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/235186/","LOCKED","235186","IBM Thomas.

"Surface-particles are very small facets, modeled as points with a normal. They can be used to visualize flow in several ways by variation of the properties of the particle sources. A method is presented for the rendering of surface-particles. This method includes an improved shading model, the use of Gaussian filters for the prevention of spatial and temporal artifacts, an efficient scan-conversion algorithm, the handling of occlusion and the simultaneous rendering of geometric objects and surface-particles. The synthesis of images with limited depth of field is described, which literally allows the scientist to focus on areas of interest.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/235226/","LOCKED","235226","Netherlands Energy Res.

"An implementation of a virtual environment for visualizing the geometry of curved spacetime by the display of interactive geodesics is described. This technique displays the paths of particles under the influence of gravity as described by the general theory of relativity and is useful in the investigation of solutions to the field equations of that theory. A boom-mounted six-degree-of-freedom head-position-sensitive stereo CRT system is used for display. A hand-position-sensitive glove controller is used to control the initial positions and directions of geodesics in spacetime. A multiprocessor graphics workstation is used for computation and rendering. Several techniques for visualizing the geometry of spacetime using geodesics are discussed. Although this work is described exclusively in the context of physical four-dimensional spacetimes, it extends to arbitrary geometries in arbitrary dimensions. While this work is intended for researchers, it is also useful for the teaching of general relativity.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/235196/","LOCKED","235196","NASA Ames Res.

"An information retrieval frame work that promotes graphical displays, and that will make documents in the computer visualizable to the searcher, is described. As examples of such graphical displays, two simulation results of using a Kohonen feature map to generate map displays for information retrieval are presented and discussed. The map displays are a mapping from a high-dimensional document space to a two-dimensional space. They show document relationships by various visual cues, such as dots, links, clusters, and areas, as well as their measurement and spatial arrangement. Using the map displays as an interface for document retrieval systems, the user is provided with richer visual information to support browsing and searching.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/235198/","LOCKED","235198","Center for Comput.

"Calico, a dynamic tool for the creation and manipulation of color mappings for the exploration of multivariate, quantitative data, was used to study the effects of user control and smooth change on user preference, accuracy, and confidence. The results of the study, as well as other user experiences with Calico, support the hypothesis that dynamic manipulation of color mappings is a useful feature of systems for the exploration of quantitative data using color. The main effect observed is a clear user preference for representations providing control over the mapping, a small but significant increase in accuracy, and greater confidence in information gleaned from manipulable displays. A smaller and less consistent effect showed greater user preference for an confidence in representations which provided smooth change between images.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/235201/","LOCKED","235201","Dept. of Comput.

"It is shown how data visualization fits into the broader process of scientific data analysis. Scientists from several disciplines were observed while they analyzed their own data. Examination of the observations exposed process elements outside conventional image viewing. For example, analysts queried for quantitative information, made a variety of comparisons, applied math, managed data, and kept records. The characterization of scientific data analysis reveals activity beyond that traditionally supported by computer. It offers an understanding which has the potential to be applied to many future designs, and suggests specific recommendations for improving the support of this important aspect of scientific computing.<>","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/235203/","LOCKED","235203","Lawrence Livermore Nat.
