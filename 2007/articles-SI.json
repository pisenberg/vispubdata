Designers, engineers, and consumers all have different design criteria, and these criteria interact. Early concepts evolve in this kind of collaborative context, and there is a need for dynamic visualization of the interaction between design shape and other shape-related design criteria. In this paper, a morphable model is defined from simplified representations of suitably chosen real cars, providing a continuous shape space to navigate, manipulate and visualize. Physical properties and consumer-provided scores for the real cars (such as 'weight' and 'sportiness') are estimated for new designs across the shape space. This coupling allows one to manipulate the shape directly while reviewing the impact on estimated criteria, or conversely, to manipulate the criterial values of the current design to produce a new shape with more desirable attributes.","article_number":"4376186","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376186","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=4376186","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376186/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4376125,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","start_page":"1552","end_page":"1559","citing_paper_count":21,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Navigation","Visualization","Solid modeling","Shape measurement","Product development","Humans","Face","Linear regression","Fingers","Design engineering"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Morphable model","shape space","barycentric coordinates","design space."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70567","title":"Interactive sound rendering in complex and dynamic scenes using frustum tracing","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":2,"volume":"13","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Campus Box 3175, Sitterson Hall, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606258500","id":37606258500,"full_name":"Christian Lauterbach","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Campus Box 3175, Sitterson Hall, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37883391100","id":37883391100,"full_name":"Anish Chandak","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Campus Box 3175, Sitterson Hall, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267825600","id":37267825600,"full_name":"Dinesh Manocha","author_order":3}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present a new approach for real-time sound rendering in complex, virtual scenes with dynamic sources and objects.

In particular, by taking advantage of physically reactive 3D shadow-space controllers, we can transform the task of interacting with 4D objects to a new level of physical reality. We begin with a teaching tool that uses 2D knot diagrams to manipulate the geometry of 3D mathematical knots via their projections; our unique 2D haptic interface allows the user to become familiar with sketching, editing, exploration, and manipulation of 3D knots rendered as projected images on a 2D shadow space. By combining graphics and collision-sensing haptics, we can enhance the 2D shadow-driven editing protocol to successfully leverage 2D pen-and-paper or blackboard skills. Building on the reduced-dimension 2D editing tool for manipulating 3D shapes, we develop the natural analogy to produce a reduced-dimension 3D tool for manipulating 4D shapes. By physically modeling the correct properties of 4D surfaces, their bending forces, and their collisions in the 3D haptic controller interface, we can support full-featured physical exploration of 4D mathematical objects in a manner that is otherwise far beyond the experience accessible to human beings.

Our research was motivated by the need to investigate the properties of a simulated porous solid as it is hit by a projectile. This paper describes two techniques for the generation of distance fields containing a minimal number of topological features, and we use them to identify features of the material. We focus on distance fields defined on a volumetric domain considering the distance to a given surface embedded within the domain. Topological features of the field are characterized by its critical points. Our first method begins with a distance field that is computed using a standard approach, and simplifies this field using ideas from Morse theory. We present a procedure for identifying and extracting a feature set through analysis of the MS complex, and apply it to find the invariants in the clean distance field. Our second method proceeds by advancing a front, beginning at the surface, and locally controlling the creation of new critical points. We demonstrate the value of topologically clean distance fields for the analysis of filament structures in porous solids. Our methods produce a curved skeleton representation of the filaments that helps material scientists to perform a detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis of pores, and hence infer important material properties. Furthermore, we provide a set of criteria for finding the \"difference\" between two skeletal structures, and use this to examine how the structure of the porous solid changes over several timesteps in the simulation of the particle impact.","article_number":"4376171","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376171","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376171/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376171/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4376125,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","start_page":"1432","end_page":"1439","citing_paper_count":60,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Laboratories","Solid modeling","Computer science","Projectiles","Materials science and technology","Data analysis","Data visualization","Scientific computing","Analytical models","Feature extraction"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Morse theory","Morse-Smale complex","distance field","topological simplification","wavefront","critical point","porous solid","material science"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70541","title":"Casual Information Visualization: Depictions of Data in Everyday Life","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":8,"volume":"13","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Interactive Computing and the GVU Center at the Georgia Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945316800","id":37945316800,"full_name":"Zachary Pousman","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"School of Interactive Computing and the GVU Center at the Georgia Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267736900","id":37267736900,"full_name":"John Stasko","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"University of California, Santa Cruz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37329261300","id":37329261300,"full_name":"Michael Mateas","author_order":3}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Information visualization has often focused on providing deep insight for expert user populations and on techniques for amplifying cognition through complicated interactive visual models.

Instead of work-related and analytically driven infovis, we propose casual information visualization (or casual infovis) as a complement to more traditional infovis domains. Traditional infovis systems, techniques, and methods do not easily lend themselves to the broad range of user populations, from expert to novices, or from work tasks to more everyday situations. We propose definitions, perspectives, and research directions for further investigations of this emerging subfield. These perspectives build from ambient information visualization (Skog et al., 2003), social visualization, and also from artistic work that visualizes information (Viegas and Wattenberg, 2007). We seek to provide a perspective on infovis that integrates these research agendas under a coherent vocabulary and framework for design. We enumerate the following contributions. First, we demonstrate how blurry the boundary of infovis is by examining systems that exhibit many of the putative properties of infovis systems, but perhaps would not be considered so. Second, we explore the notion of insight and how, instead of a monolithic definition of insight, there may be multiple types, each with particular characteristics. Third, we discuss design challenges for systems intended for casual audiences.

In this context the use of metaphors plays an important role since they make complex information easily accessible by using commonly known concepts. In this paper we propose a new metaphor, called \"topological landscapes,\" which facilitates understanding the topological structure of scalar functions. The basic idea is to construct a terrain with the same topology as a given dataset and to display the terrain as an easily understood representation of the actual input data. In this projection from an n-dimensional scalar function to a two-dimensional (2D) model we preserve function values of critical points, the persistence (function span) of topological features, and one possible additional metric property (in our examples volume). By displaying this topologically equivalent landscape together with the original data we harness the natural human proficiency in understanding terrain topography and make complex topological information easily accessible.","article_number":"4376169","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376169","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376169/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376169/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4376125,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","start_page":"1416","end_page":"1423","citing_paper_count":63,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Topology","Histograms","Isosurfaces","Laboratories","Two dimensional displays","Humans","Surfaces","Computer vision","User interfaces"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Feature Detection (primary keyword)","User Interfaces","Visual Analytics","Contour Tree","Terrain","Topology","SOAR"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70595","title":"Similarity-Guided Streamline Placement with Error Evaluation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":11,"volume":"13","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Johns Hopkins University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37965943900","id":37965943900,"full_name":"Yuan Chen","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275763600","id":37275763600,"full_name":"Jonathan Cohen","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Johns Hopkins University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37955208400","id":37955208400,"full_name":"Julian Krolik","author_order":3}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Most streamline generation algorithms either provide a particular density of streamlines across the domain or explicitly detect features, such as critical points, and follow customized rules to emphasize those features. However, the former generally includes many redundant streamlines, and the latter requires Boolean decisions on which points are features (and may thus suffer from robustness problems for real-world data). We take a new approach to adaptive streamline placement for steady vector fields in 2D and 3D. We define a metric for local similarity among streamlines and use this metric to grow streamlines from a dense set of candidate seed points. The metric considers not only Euclidean distance, but also a simple statistical measure of shape and directional similarity. Without explicit feature detection, our method produces streamlines that naturally accentuate regions of geometric interest. In conjunction with this method, we also propose a quantitative error metric for evaluating a streamline representation based on how well it preserves the information from the original vector field. This error metric reconstructs a vector field from points on the streamline representation and computes a difference of the reconstruction from the original vector field.","article_number":"4376173","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376173","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376173/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376173/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4376125,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","start_page":"1448","end_page":"1455","citing_paper_count":46,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Computer vision","Robustness","Euclidean distance","Shape measurement","Magnetic fields","Convolution","Magnetohydrodynamics","Extraterrestrial measurements","Magnetic field measurement","Magnetic properties"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Adaptive streamlines","vector field reconstruction","shape matching"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70621","title":"Visualizing the History of Living Spaces","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":12,"volume":"13","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Mitsubuishi Electric Research Labs","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37610396000","id":37610396000,"full_name":"Yuri Ivanov","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Mitsubuishi Electric Research Labs","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37269410400","id":37269410400,"full_name":"Christopher Wren","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"UIUC","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37408858200","id":37408858200,"full_name":"Alexander Sorokin","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"MIT Media Lab","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37952472500","id":37952472500,"full_name":"Ishwinder Kaur","author_order":4}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The technology available to building designers now makes it possible to monitor buildings on a very large scale. Video cameras and motion sensors are commonplace in practically every office space, and are slowly making their way into living spaces. The application of such technologies, in particular video cameras, while improving security, also violates privacy. On the other hand, motion sensors, while being privacy-conscious, typically do not provide enough information for a human operator to maintain the same degree of awareness about the space that can be achieved by using video cameras. We propose a novel approach in which we use a large number of simple motion sensors and a small set of video cameras to monitor a large office space. In our system we deployed 215 motion sensors and six video cameras to monitor the 3,000-square-meter office space occupied by 80 people for a period of about one year. The main problem in operating such systems is finding a way to present this highly multidimensional data, which includes both spatial and temporal components, to a human operator to allow browsing and searching recorded data in an efficient and intuitive way. In this paper we present our experiences and the solutions that we have developed in the course of our work on the system.

Paths through the volume are assigned costs that are lower if they are consistent with the preferred diffusion directions. The proposed method finds a set of voxels in the DTI volume that contain paths between two regions whose costs are within a threshold of the optimal path. The result is a volumetric optimal path analysis, which is driven by clinical and scientific questions relating to the connectivity between various known anatomical regions of the brain. To solve the minimal path problem quickly, we introduce a novel numerical algorithm for solving H-J equations, which we call the fast iterative method (FIM). This algorithm is well-adapted to parallel architectures, and we present a GPU-based implementation, which runs roughly 50-100 times faster than traditional CPU-based solvers for anisotropic H-J equations. The proposed system allows users to freely change the endpoints of interesting pathways and to visualize the optimal volumetric path between them at an interactive rate. We demonstrate the proposed method on some synthetic and real DT-MRI datasets and compare the performance with existing methods.","article_number":"4376177","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376177","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376177/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376177/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4376125,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","start_page":"1480","end_page":"1487","citing_paper_count":45,"citing_patent_count":3,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Diffusion tensor imaging","Equations","Graphics","Iterative algorithms","Tensile stress","Radio access networks","Concurrent computing","Costs","Anisotropic magnetoresistance"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Diffusion tensor visualization","graphics hardware","interactivity."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70553","title":"Efficient Surface Reconstruction using Generalized Coulomb Potentials","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":21,"volume":"13","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Institute for Mathematics and Computing Science, University of Groningen, The Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279264300","id":37279264300,"full_name":"Andrei C.

The method employs a fast convection algorithm to attract the evolving surface towards the data points. The force field in which the surface is convected is based on generalized Coulomb potentials evaluated on an adaptive grid (i.e., an octree) using a fast, hierarchical algorithm. Formulating reconstruction as a convection problem in a velocity field generated by Coulomb potentials offers a number of advantages. Unlike methods which compute the distance from the data set to the implicit surface, which are sensitive to noise due to the very reliance on the distance transform, our method is highly resilient to shot noise since global, generalized Coulomb potentials can be used to disregard the presence of outliers due to noise. Coulomb potentials represent long-range interactions that consider all data points at once, and thus they convey global information which is crucial in the fitting process. Both the spatial and temporal complexities of our spatially-adaptive method are proportional to the size of the reconstructed object, which makes our method compare favorably with respect to previous approaches in terms of speed and flexibility. Experiments with sparse as well as noisy data sets show that the method is capable of delivering crisp and detailed yet smooth surfaces.","article_number":"4376181","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376181","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376181/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376181/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4376125,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","start_page":"1512","end_page":"1519","citing_paper_count":13,"citing_patent_count":1,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Surface reconstruction","Surface contamination","Surface fitting","Clouds","Topology","Tagging","Mathematics","Noise robustness","Noise level"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Surface reconstruction","Implicit surfaces","Octrees","Generalized Coulomb potentials","Polygonization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70515","title":"Toward a Deeper Understanding of the Role of Interaction in Information Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":22,"volume":"13","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Health Systems Institute & H.

Several approaches have been proposed for representing data in these situations. In this paper we focus on strategies for the visualization of multivariate data that rely on color mixing. In particular, through a series of controlled observer experiments, we seek to establish a fundamental understanding of the information-carrying capacities of two alternative methods for encoding multivariate information using color: color blending and color weaving. We begin with a baseline experiment in which we assess participants' abilities to accurately read numerical data encoded in six different basic color scales defined in the L*a*b* color space. We then assess participants' abilities to read combinations of 2, 3, 4 and 6 different data values represented in a common region of the domain, encoded using either color blending or color weaving. In color blending a single mixed color is formed via linear combination of the individual values in L*a*b* space, and in color weaving the original individual colors are displayed side-by-side in a high frequency texture that fills the region. A third experiment was conducted to clarify some of the trends regarding the color contrast and its effect on the magnitude of the error that was observed in the second experiment. The results indicate that when the component colors are represented side-by-side in a high frequency texture, most participants' abilities to infer the values of individual components are significantly improved, relative to when the colors are blended. Participants' performance was significantly better with color weaving particularly when more than 2 colors were used, and even when the individual colors subtended only 3 minutes of visual angle in the texture. However, the information-carrying capacity of the color weaving approach has its limits. We found that participants' abilities to accurately interpret each of the individual components in a high frequency color texture typically falls off as the number of components increases from 4 to 6. We found no significant advantages, in either color blending or color weaving, to using color scales based on component hues thatare more widely separated in the L*a*b* color space. Furthermore, we found some indications that extra difficulties may arise when opponent hues are employed.","article_number":"4376150","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376150","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376150/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376150/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4376125,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","start_page":"1270","end_page":"1277","citing_paper_count":40,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Weaving","Data visualization","Frequency","Color","Encoding","Meteorology","Geology","Astronomy","Displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Color","perception","visualization","color weaving","color blending."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70576","title":"LiveSync: Deformed Viewing Spheres for Knowledge-Based Navigation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":27,"volume":"13","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Vienna Univ. of Technol., Vienna","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37623778100","id":37623778100,"full_name":"Peter Kohlmann","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Vienna Univ. of Technol., Vienna","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37265895700","id":37265895700,"full_name":"Stefan Bruckner","author_order":2},{"authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282727500","id":37282727500,"full_name":"Armin Kanitsar","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"IEEE Computer Society","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282552200","id":37282552200,"full_name":"Eduard Gröller","author_order":4}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Although real-time interactive volume rendering is available even for very large data sets, this visualization method is used quite rarely in the clinical practice.

Because of this, most often only 2D slices of the data set are examined. Our work introduces LiveSync, a new concept to synchronize 2D slice views and volumetric views of medical data sets. Through intuitive picking actions on the slice, the users define the anatomical structures they are interested in. The 3D volumetric view is updated automatically with the goal that the users are provided with expressive result images. To achieve this live synchronization we use a minimal set of derived information without the need for segmented data sets or data-specific pre-computations. The components we consider are the picked point, slice view zoom, patient orientation, viewpoint history, local object shape and visibility. We introduce deformed viewing spheres which encode the viewpoint quality for the components. A combination of these deformed viewing spheres is used to estimate a good viewpoint.

Participants were 8% more accurate in recalling causal semantics when they were presented using animations instead of static graphs. In the second study (N=112) we evaluated the intuitiveness of the representations. Our results showed that while users were as accurate with the static graphs as with the animations, they were 9% faster in matching the correct causal statements in the animated condition.

In this paper, we present strategies to visualize changes of hierarchical data using treemaps. A new treemap layout algorithm is presented to reduce abrupt layout changes and produce consistent visual patterns. Techniques are proposed to effectively visualize the difference and contrast between two treemap snapshots in terms of the map items' colors, sizes, and positions. Experimental data show that our algorithm can achieve a good balance in maintaining a treemap's stability, continuity, readability, and average aspect ratio.

It adaptively combines original unstructured bricks in important (focus) regions, with structured bricks that are resampled on demand in less important (context) regions. The basis of this focus+context approach is interactive specification of a scalar degree of interest (DOI) function. Thus, rendering always considers two volumes simultaneously: a scalar data volume, and the current DOI volume. The crucial problem of visibility sorting is solved by raycasting individual bricks and compositing in visibility order from front to back. In order to minimize visual errors at the grid boundary, it is always rendered accurately, even for resampled bricks. A variety of different rendering modes can be combined, including contour enhancement. A very important property of our approach is that it supports a variety of cell types natively, i.e., it is not constrained to tetrahedral grids, even when interpolation within cells is used. Moreover, our framework can handle multi-variate data, e.g., multiple scalar channels such as temperature or pressure, as well as time-dependent data. The combination of unstructured and structured bricks with different quality characteristics such as the type of interpolation or resampling resolution in conjunction with custom texture memory management yields a very scalable system.","article_number":"4376191","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376191","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376191/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376191/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4376125,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","start_page":"1592","end_page":"1599","citing_paper_count":16,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Interpolation","Sorting","Computational fluid dynamics","Computational modeling","Grid computing","Temperature","Memory management","Quality management","Finite volume methods","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Volume Rendering of Unstructured Grids","Focus+Context Techniques","Hardware-Assisted Volume Rendering"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70582","title":"NodeTrix: a Hybrid Visualization of Social Networks","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":32,"volume":"13","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"INRIA Futurs/University Paris-Sud, France and University of Sydney, Australia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37839948300","id":37839948300,"full_name":"Nathalie Henry","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"INRIA Futurs, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407972900","id":37407972900,"full_name":"Jean-Daniel Fekete","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Ontario Cancer Institute and University of Toronto, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38526446600","id":38526446600,"full_name":"Michael J.

Unfortunately, the visualizations in existing systems do not satisfactorily resolve the basic dilemma of being readable both for the global structure of the network and also for detailed analysis of local communities. To address this problem, we present NodeTrix, a hybrid representation for networks that combines the advantages of two traditional representations: node-link diagrams are used to show the global structure of a network, while arbitrary portions of the network can be shown as adjacency matrices to better support the analysis of communities. A key contribution is a set of interaction techniques. These allow analysts to create a NodeTrix visualization by dragging selections to and from node-link and matrix forms, and to flexibly manipulate the NodeTrix representation to explore the dataset and create meaningful summary visualizations of their findings. Finally, we present a case study applying NodeTrix to the analysis of the InfoVis 2004 coauthorship dataset to illustrate the capabilities of NodeTrix as both an exploration tool and an effective means of communicating results.","article_number":"4376154","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376154","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376154/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376154/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4376125,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","start_page":"1302","end_page":"1309","citing_paper_count":267,"citing_patent_count":4,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Layout","Color","Animation","Matrix converters","Sparse matrices","Aggregates"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Network visualization","Matrix visualization","Hybrid visualization","Aggregation","Interaction."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70573","title":"Lattice-Based Volumetric Global Illumination","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":33,"volume":"13","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794-4400","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37416126400","id":37416126400,"full_name":"Feng Qiu","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794-4400","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275296400","id":37275296400,"full_name":"Fang Xu","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794-4400","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273608100","id":37273608100,"full_name":"Zhe Fan","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794-4400","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945247700","id":37945247700,"full_name":"Neophytou Neophytos","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794-4400","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268052800","id":37268052800,"full_name":"Arie Kaufman","author_order":5},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794-4400","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273119700","id":37273119700,"full_name":"Klaus Mueller","author_order":6}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We describe a novel volumetric global illumination framework based on the face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice.

There are many different ways to enhance depth perception, such as shading, contours, and shadows. Artists and illustrators frequently employ halos for this purpose. In this technique, regions surrounding the edges of certain structures are darkened or brightened which makes it easier to judge occlusion. Based on this concept, we present a flexible method for enhancing and highlighting structures of interest using GPU-based direct volume rendering. Our approach uses an interactively defined halo transfer function to classify structures of interest based on data value, direction, and position. A feature-preserving spreading algorithm is applied to distribute seed values to neighboring locations, generating a controllably smooth field of halo intensities. These halo intensities are then mapped to colors and opacities using a halo profile function.

Condensation is found in many physical phenomena, e.g. the formation of atmospheric clouds or the processes inside steam turbines, where a detailed knowledge of the dynamics of condensation processes will help to optimize energy efficiency and avoid problems with droplets of macroscopic size. The key properties of these processes are the nucleation rate and the critical cluster size. For the calculation of these properties it is essential to make use of a meaningful definition of molecular clusters, which currently is a not completely resolved issue. In this paper a framework capable of interactively visualizing molecular datasets of such nucleation simulations is presented, with an emphasis on the detected molecular clusters. To check the quality of the results of the cluster detection, our framework introduces the concept of flow groups to highlight potential cluster evolution over time which is not detected by the employed algorithm. To confirm the findings of the visual analysis, we coupled the rendering view with a schematic view of the clusters' evolution. This allows to rapidly assess the quality of the molecular cluster detection algorithm and to identify locations in the simulation data in space as well as in time where the cluster detection fails. Thus, thermodynamics researchers can eliminate weaknesses in their cluster detection algorithms. Several examples for the effective and efficient usage of our tool are presented.","article_number":"4376195","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376195","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376195/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376195/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4376125,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","start_page":"1624","end_page":"1631","citing_paper_count":23,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Thermodynamics","Turbines","Interactive systems","Clouds","Energy efficiency","Detection algorithms","Data visualization","Metastasis","Energy resolution","Clustering algorithms"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Cluster detection analysis","molecular dynamics visualization","time-dependent scattered data","glyph visualization","out-of-core techniques","evolution graph view"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70538","title":"An Effective Illustrative Visualization Framework Based on Photic Extremum Lines (PELs)","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":37,"volume":"13","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37629748900","id":37629748900,"full_name":"Xuexiang Xie","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37532431100","id":37532431100,"full_name":"Ying He","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271188400","id":37271188400,"full_name":"Feng Tian","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282337400","id":37282337400,"full_name":"Hock-Soon Seah","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, New York","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37276603700","id":37276603700,"full_name":"Xianfeng Gu","author_order":5},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, New York","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37276553900","id":37276553900,"full_name":"Hong Qin","author_order":6}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Conveying shape using feature lines is an important visualization tool in visual computing.

This paper is strongly inspired by the observation in human vision and perception that a sudden change in the luminance plays a critical role to faithfully represent and recover the 3D information. In particular, we adopt the edge detection techniques in image processing for 3D shape visualization and present photic extremum lines (PELs) which emphasize significant variations of illumination over 3D surfaces. Comparing with the existing feature lines, PELs are more flexible and offer users more freedom to achieve desirable visualization effects. In addition, the user can easily control the shape visualization by changing the light position, the number of light sources, and choosing various light models.

In addition to allowing developers and users to freely combine algorithms, visualization pipelines have proven to work well when streaming data and scale well on parallel distributed- memory computers. However, current pipeline visualization frameworks have a critical flaw: they are unable to manage time varying data. As data flows through the pipeline, each algorithm has access to only a single snapshot in time of the data. This prevents the implementation of algorithms that do any temporal processing such as particle tracing; plotting over time; or interpolation, fitting, or smoothing of time series data. As data acquisition technology improves, as simulation time-integration techniques become more complex, and as simulations save less frequently and regularly, the ability to analyze the time-behavior of data becomes more important. This paper describes a modification to the traditional pipeline architecture that allows it to accommodate temporal algorithms. Furthermore, the architecture allows temporal algorithms to be used in conjunction with algorithms expecting a single time snapshot, thus simplifying software design and allowing adoption into existing pipeline frameworks. Our architecture also continues to work well in parallel distributed-memory environments. We demonstrate our architecture by modifying the popular VTK framework and exposing the functionality to the ParaView application. We use this framework to apply time-dependent algorithms on large data with a parallel cluster computer and thereby exercise a functionality that previously did not exist.","article_number":"4376164","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376164","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376164/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376164/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4376125,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","start_page":"1376","end_page":"1383","citing_paper_count":21,"citing_patent_count":1,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Pipelines","Computer architecture","Data visualization","Application software","Concurrent computing","Analytical models","Software algorithms","Libraries","Distributed computing","Interpolation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["data-parallel visualization pipeline","time-varying data"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70559","title":"Grid With a View: Optimal Texturing for Perception of Layered Surface Shape","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":42,"volume":"13","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Texas A&M University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37565577300","id":37565577300,"full_name":"Alethea Bair","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Texas A&M University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284216700","id":37284216700,"full_name":"Donald House","author_order":2}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present the results of two controlled studies comparing layered surface visualizations under various texture conditions.

Variations in relative texture spacing on top and bottom surfaces were compared, as well as opacity of the top surface. Significant improvements are found for the textured cases over non-textured surfaces. Either larger or thinner top-surface textures, and lower top surface opacities are shown to give less bottom surface error. Top surface error appears to be highly resilient to changes in texture.

These take into account the intensity and phase shift of multiple reflections due to a wave front emanating from a sound source. Definition (D50) and clarity (C50) for example correspond to the fraction of the energy received in total to the energy received in the first 50 ms at a certain listener position. Unfortunately, the impulse response measured at a single point does not provide any information about the direction of reflections, and about the reflection surfaces which contribute to this measure. For the visualization of room acoustics, however, this information is very useful since it allows to discover regions with high contribution and provides insight into the influence of all reflecting surfaces to the quality measure. We use the phonon tracing method to calculate the contribution of the reflection surfaces to the impulse response for different listener positions. This data is used to compute importance values for the geometry taking a certain acoustic metric into account. To get a visual insight into the directional aspect, we map the importance to the reflecting surfaces of the geometry. This visualization indicates which parts of the surfaces need to be changed to enhance the chosen acoustic quality measure. We apply our method to the acoustic improvement of a lecture hall by means of enhancing the overall speech comprehensibility (clarity) and evaluate the results using glyphs to visualize the clarity (C50) values at listener positions throughout the room.","article_number":"4376202","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376202","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376202/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376202/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4376125,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","start_page":"1680","end_page":"1687","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Acoustic reflection","Acoustic measurements","Optical surface waves","Optical reflection","Phonons","Acoustic applications","Geometry","Data visualization","Absorption","Frequency"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Sound analytics","Applications of Visualization","Room Acoustics","Phonon Tracing","Acoustic Metric"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70569","title":"Interactive Visual Analysis of Perfusion Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":45,"volume":"13","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Simulation and Graphics, University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37424645600","id":37424645600,"full_name":"Steffen Oeltze","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546620400","id":37546620400,"full_name":"Helmut Doleisch","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274158800","id":37274158800,"full_name":"Helwig Hauser","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546620600","id":37546620600,"full_name":"Philipp Muigg","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"Department of Simulation and Graphics, University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37424645300","id":37424645300,"full_name":"Bernhard Preim","author_order":5}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Perfusion data are dynamic medical image data which characterize the regional blood flow in human tissue. These data bear a great potential in medical diagnosis, since diseases can be better distinguished and detected at an earlier stage compared to static image data. The wide-spread use of perfusion data is hampered by the lack of efficient evaluation methods. For each voxel, a time-intensity curve characterizes the enhancement of a contrast agent. Parameters derived from these curves characterize the perfusion and have to be integrated for diagnosis. The diagnostic evaluation of this multi-field data is challenging and time-consuming due to its complexity. For the visual analysis of such datasets, feature-based approaches allow to reduce the amount of data and direct the user to suspicious areas. We present an interactive visual analysis approach for the evaluation of perfusion data. For this purpose, we integrate statistical methods and interactive feature specification. Correlation analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are applied for dimension reduction and to achieve a better understanding of the inter-parameter relations. Multiple, linked views facilitate the definition of features by brushing multiple dimensions. The specification result is linked to all views establishing a focus+context style of visualization in 3D. We discuss our approach with respect to clinical datasets from the three major application areas: ischemic stroke diagnosis, breast tumor diagnosis, as well as the diagnosis of the coronary heart disease (CHD). It turns out that the significance of perfusion parameters strongly depends on the individual patient, scanning parameters, and data pre-processing.","article_number":"4376166","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376166","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376166/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376166/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4376125,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","start_page":"1392","end_page":"1399","citing_paper_count":36,"citing_patent_count":3,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data analysis","Principal component analysis","Biomedical imaging","Medical diagnostic imaging","Blood flow","Humans","Medical diagnosis","Diseases","Statistical analysis","Focusing"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Multi-field Visualization","Visual Data Mining","Time-varying Volume Data","Integrating InfoVis/SciVis"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70572","title":"IStar: A Raster Representation for Scalable Image and Volume Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":46,"volume":"13","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Advanced Graphics Lab at the University of New Mexico","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37324263400","id":37324263400,"full_name":"Joe Kniss","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Advanced Graphics Lab at the University of New Mexico","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37621921500","id":37621921500,"full_name":"Warren Hunt","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"School of Computing at the University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37665456000","id":37665456000,"full_name":"Kristin Potter","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Advanced Graphics Lab at the University of New Mexico","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37401656800","id":37401656800,"full_name":"Pradeep Sen","author_order":4}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Topology has been an important tool for analyzing scalar data and flow fields in visualization.

This graph structure, along with a sampled representation of the segmented data set, is embedded into a standard raster image which can then be substantially downsampled and compressed. During rendering, the raster image is upsampled and the dual graph is used to reconstruct the original function. Unlike traditional raster approaches, our representation can preserve sharp discontinuities at any level of magnification, much like scalable vector graphics.

Precise preoperative planning of these procedures, however, is necessary to achieve an optimal therapeutic effect. Therefore, multiple radiological imaging modalities are used prior to surgery to delineate the patient's anatomy, neurological function, and metabolic processes. Developing a three-dimensional perception of the surgical approach, however, is traditionally still done by mentally fusing multiple modalities. Concurrent 3D visualization of these datasets can, therefore, improve the planning process significantly. In this paper we introduce an application for planning of individual neurosurgical approaches with high-quality interactive multimodal volume rendering. The application consists of three main modules which allow to (1) plan the optimal skin incision and opening of the skull tailored to the underlying pathology; (2) visualize superficial brain anatomy, function and metabolism; and (3) plan the patient-specific approach for surgery of deep-seated lesions. The visualization is based on direct multi-volume raycasting on graphics hardware, where multiple volumes from different modalities can be displayed concurrently at interactive frame rates. Graphics memory limitations are avoided by performing raycasting on bricked volumes. For preprocessing tasks such as registration or segmentation, the visualization modules are integrated into a larger framework, thus supporting the entire workflow of preoperative planning.","article_number":"4376204","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376204","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376204/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376204/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4376125,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","start_page":"1696","end_page":"1703","citing_paper_count":68,"citing_patent_count":3,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Neurosurgery","Surgery","Visualization","Anatomy","Pathology","Graphics","Process planning","Skin","Skull","Brain"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Multimodal Volume Rendering","Hardware Assisted Raycasting","Surgery Planning"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70523","title":"Visual Analysis of the Air Pollution Problem in Hong Kong","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":50,"volume":"13","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37306509700","id":37306509700,"full_name":"Wing-Yi Chan","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Beijing Normal University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37854704700","id":37854704700,"full_name":"Anbang Xu","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088377822","id":37088377822,"full_name":"Kai-Lun Chung","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088377523","id":37088377523,"full_name":"Kai-Hon Lau","author_order":5},{"affiliation":"Beijing Normal University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37320676800","id":37320676800,"full_name":"Ping Guo","author_order":6}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present a comprehensive system for weather data visualization.

The new class of moment invariants we have developed allows us to extract and visualize 2D flow patterns, invariant under translation, scaling, and rotation. With our approach one can study arbitrary flow patterns by searching a given 2D flow data set for any type of pattern as specified by a user. Further, our approach supports the computation of moments at multiple scales, facilitating fast pattern extraction and recognition. This can be done for critical point classification, but also for patterns with greater complexity. This multi-scale moment representation is also valuable for the comparative visualization of flow field data. The specific novel contributions of the work presented are the mathematical derivation of the new class of moment invariants, their analysis regarding critical point features, the efficient computation of a novel feature space representation, and based upon this the development of a fast pattern recognition algorithm for complex flow structures.","article_number":"4376210","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376210","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376210/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376210/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4376125,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","start_page":"1743","end_page":"1750","citing_paper_count":43,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Pattern recognition","Data mining","Computer vision","Space technology","Feature extraction","Data analysis","Application software","Pattern analysis","Algorithm design and analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Flow Visualization","Feature Detection","Pattern Recognition","Image Processing"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70554","title":"Efficient Visualization of Lagrangian Coherent Structures by Filtered AMR Ridge Extraction","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":55,"volume":"13","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"ETH Zurich, Switzerland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282541900","id":37282541900,"full_name":"Filip Sadlo","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"ETH Zurich, Switzerland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282541100","id":37282541100,"full_name":"Ronald Peikert","author_order":2}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"This paper presents a method for filtered ridge extraction based on adaptive mesh refinement. It is applicable in situations where the underlying scalar field can be refined during ridge extraction.

The Lagrangian coherent structures are extracted as ridges in finite Lyapunov exponent fields computed from these grids of trajectories. The method is applied to several variants of finite Lyapunov exponents, one of which is newly introduced. High computation time due to the high number of required trajectories is a main drawback when computing Lyapunov exponents of 3-dimensional vector fields.

A flexible and efficient GPU-based rendering technique for DTI tractography data is presented that addresses common performance bottlenecks and image-quality issues, allowing interactive render rates to be achieved on commodity hardware. An occlusion query-based pathway LoD management system for streamlines/streamtubes/tuboids is introduced that optimizes input geometry, vertex processing, and fragment processing loads, and helps reduce overdraw. The tuboid, a fully-shaded streamtube impostor constructed entirely on the GPU from streamline vertices, is also introduced. Unlike full streamtubes and other impostor constructs, tuboids require little to no preprocessing or extra space over the original streamline data. The supported fragment processing levels of detail range from texture-based draft shading to full raycast normal computation, Phong shading, environment mapping, and curvature-correct text labeling. The presented text labeling technique for tuboids provides adaptive, aesthetically pleasing labels that appear attached to the surface of the tubes. Furthermore, an occlusion query aggregating and scheduling scheme for tuboids is described that reduces the query overhead. Results for a tractography dataset are presented, and demonstrate that LoD-managed tuboids offer benefits over traditional streamtubes both in performance and appearance.","article_number":"4376178","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376178","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376178/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376178/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4376125,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","start_page":"1488","end_page":"1495","citing_paper_count":31,"citing_patent_count":1,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Diffusion tensor imaging","Streaming media","Labeling","Humans","Data mining","Diseases","Rendering (computer graphics)","Computer graphics","Hardware"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Tuboids","streamtubes","interactive gpu-centric rendering","neuronal pathways."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70598","title":"Surface Extraction from Multi-Material Components for Metrology using Dual Energy CT","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":65,"volume":"13","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Upper Austrian Univ. of Appl.

Based on the dual source / dual exposure technology this method employs 3DCT scans of a high precision micro-focus and a high energy macro-focus X-ray source. The presented work makes use of the advantages of dual X-ray exposure technology in order to facilitate dimensional measurements of multi-material components with high density material within low density material. We propose a workflow which uses image fusion and local surface extraction techniques: a prefiltering step reduces noise inherent in the data. For image fusion the datasets have to be registered. In the fusion step the benefits of both scans are combined. The structure of the specimen is taken from the low precision, blurry, high energy dataset while the sharp edges are adopted and fused into the resulting image from the high precision, crisp, low energy dataset. In the final step a reliable surface model is extracted from the fused dataset using a local adaptive technique. The major contribution of this paper is the development of a specific workflow for dimensional measurements of multi-material industrial components, which takes two X-ray CT datasets with complementary strengths and weaknesses into account. The performance of the workflow is discussed using a test specimen as well as two real world industrial parts. As result, a significant improvement in overall measurement precision, surface geometry and mean deviation to reference measurement compared to single exposure scans was facilitated.","article_number":"4376182","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376182","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376182/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376182/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4376125,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","start_page":"1520","end_page":"1527","citing_paper_count":36,"citing_patent_count":2,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Metrology","Computed tomography","X-ray imaging","Image fusion","Computer industry","Energy resolution","Density measurement","Data mining","Noise reduction","Testing"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["DECT image fusion","local surface extraction","Dual Energy CT","metrology","dimensional measurement","variance comparison."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70568","title":"Interactive Tree Comparison for Co-located Collaborative Information Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":66,"volume":"13","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Univ. of Calgary, Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591317800","id":37591317800,"full_name":"Petra Isenberg","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Univ. of Calgary, Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37285000100","id":37285000100,"full_name":"Sheelagh Carpendale","author_order":2}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In many domains, increased collaboration has lead to more innovation by fostering the sharing of knowledge, skills, and ideas.

As a result, recent work in the visualization community has focused either on designing sequential access compression schemes or on producing cache-coherent layouts of (uncompressed) meshes for random access. Unfortunately combining these two strategies is challenging as they fundamentally assume conflicting modes of data access. In this paper, we propose a novel order-preserving compression method that supports transparent random access to compressed triangle meshes. Our decompression method selectively fetches from disk, decodes, and caches in memory requested parts of a mesh. We also provide a general mesh access API for seamless mesh traversal and incidence queries. While the method imposes no particular mesh layout, it is especially suitable for cache-oblivious layouts, which minimize the number of decompression I/O requests and provide high cache utilization during access to decompressed, in-memory portions of the mesh. Moreover, the transparency of our scheme enables improved performance without the need for application code changes. We achieve compression rates on the order of 20:1 and significantly improved I/O performance due to reduced data transfer. To demonstrate the benefits of our method, we implement two common applications as benchmarks. By using cache-oblivious layouts for the input models, we observe 2-6 times overall speedup compared to using uncompressed meshes.","article_number":"4376184","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376184","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376184/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376184/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4376125,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","start_page":"1536","end_page":"1543","citing_paper_count":24,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Bandwidth","Data visualization","Data structures","Memory management","Delay","Space technology","Cache storage","Decoding","Computer displays","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Mesh compression","random access","cache-coherent layouts","mesh data structures","external memory algorithms"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70540","title":"Browsing Zoomable Treemaps: Structure-Aware Multi-Scale Navigation Techniques","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":68,"volume":"13","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Univ. of Grenoble 1, Grenoble","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945254300","id":37945254300,"full_name":"Renaud Blanch","author_order":1},{"authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38342554600","id":38342554600,"full_name":"Eric Lecolinet","author_order":2}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Treemaps provide an interesting solution for representing hierarchical data. However, most studies have mainly focused on layout algorithms and paid limited attention to the interaction with treemaps. This makes it difficult to explore large data sets and to get access to details, especially to those related to the leaves of the trees. We propose the notion of zoomable treemaps (ZTMs), an hybridization between treemaps and zoomable user interfaces that facilitates the navigation in large hierarchical data sets. By providing a consistent set of interaction techniques, ZTMs make it possible for users to browse through very large data sets (e.g., 700,000 nodes dispatched amongst 13 levels). These techniques use the structure of the displayed data to guide the interaction and provide a way to improve interactive navigation in treemaps.","article_number":"4376147","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376147","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376147/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376147/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4376125,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","start_page":"1248","end_page":"1253","citing_paper_count":35,"citing_patent_count":1,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Navigation","User interfaces","Tree graphs","Data visualization","File systems","Filling","Layout"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Information visualization","multi-scale interaction","structure-aware navigation","zoomable treemaps."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70583","title":"Overview Use in Multiple Visual Information Resolution Interfaces","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":69,"volume":"13","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Univ. of British Columbia, Vancouver","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37873130000","id":37873130000,"full_name":"Heidi Lam","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"IEEE Computer Society","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349490300","id":37349490300,"full_name":"Tamara Munzner","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"IEEE Computer Society","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37587984100","id":37587984100,"full_name":"Robert Kincaid","author_order":3}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In interfaces that provide multiple visual information resolutions (VIR), low-VIR overviews typically sacrifice visual details for display capacity, with the assumption that users can select regions of interest to examine at higher VI Rs. Designers can create low VIRs based on multi-level structure inherent in the data, but have little guidance with single-level data. To better guide design tradeoff between display capacity and visual target perceivability, we looked at overview use in two multiple-VIR interfaces with high-VIR displays either embedded within, or separate from, the overviews. We studied two visual requirements for effective overview and found that participants would reliably use the low-VIR overviews only when the visual targets were simple and had small visual spans. Otherwise, at least 20% chose to use the high-VIR view exclusively. Surprisingly, neither of the multiple-VIR interfaces provided performance benefits when compared to using the high-VIR view alone. However, we did observe benefits in providing side-by-side comparisons for target matching. We conjecture that the high cognitive load of multiple-VIR interface interactions, whether real or perceived, is a more considerable barrier to their effective use than was previously considered.","article_number":"4376151","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376151","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376151/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376151/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4376125,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","start_page":"1278","end_page":"1285","citing_paper_count":27,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Displays","Electronic mail","Data visualization","History","Object detection","Encoding"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Multiple resolutions","overview use","user study."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70534","title":"A Flexible Multi-Volume Shader Framework for Arbitrarily Intersecting Multi-Resolution Datasets","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":70,"volume":"13","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Bauhaus-Univ.

For the task we studied, point-based spatializations were far superior to landscapes, and 2D landscapes were superior to 3D landscapes. Little or no benefit was found for redundantly encoding data using colour or greyscale combined with landscape height. 3D landscapes with no colour scale (height-only) were particularly slow and inaccurate. A colour scale was found to be better than a greyscale for all display types, but a greyscale was helpful compared to height-only. These results suggest that point-based spatializations should be chosen over landscape representations, at least for tasks involving only point data itself rather than derived information about the data space.","article_number":"4376149","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376149","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376149/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376149/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4376125,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","start_page":"1262","end_page":"1269","citing_paper_count":24,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Surface topography","Encoding","Surface fitting","Two dimensional displays","Visual databases","Three dimensional displays","Spatial databases","Fuel economy","Usability"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Spatialization","Information Landscape","User Study","Numerosity","3D","2D","Colour","Greyscale","Surface","Points"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70556","title":"Exploring Multiple Trees through DAG Representations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":72,"volume":"13","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"IEEE Computer Society","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37739295500","id":37739295500,"full_name":"Martin Graham","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Napier Univ, Edinburgh","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37334180100","id":37334180100,"full_name":"Jessie Kennedy","author_order":2}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present a directed acyclic graph visualisation designed to allow interaction with a set of multiple classification trees, specifically to find overlaps and differences between groups of trees and individual trees.

In this paper, we identify and begin to characterize an overall class of visualization techniques that combine video with 3D spatial context. This set of techniques, which we call contextualized videos, forms a design palette which must be well understood so that designers can select and use appropriate techniques that address the requirements of particular spatial video tasks.

We then describe our contextualized video testbed which allows us to explore this design space and compose various video visualizations for evaluation.

Volumetric compression in which the decompression is coupled to rendering has been shown to be an effective solution to this problem; however, most existing techniques were developed in the context of software volume rendering, and all but the simplest approaches are prohibitive in a real-time hardware-accelerated volume rendering context. In this paper we present a novel block-based transform coding scheme designed specifically with real-time volume rendering in mind, such that the decompression is fast without sacrificing compression quality. This is made possible by consolidating the inverse transform with dequantization in such a way as to allow most of the reprojection to be precomputed. Furthermore, we take advantage of the freedom afforded by offline compression in order to optimize the encoding as much as possible while hiding this complexity from the decoder. In this context we develop a new block classification scheme which allows us to preserve perceptually important features in the compression. The result of this work is an asymmetric transform coding scheme that allows very large volumes to be compressed and then decompressed in real-time while rendering on the GPU.","article_number":"4376192","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376192","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376192/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376192/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4376125,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","start_page":"1600","end_page":"1607","citing_paper_count":38,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Transform coding","Rendering (computer graphics)","Graphics","Hardware","Pipelines","Data visualization","Encoding","Decoding","Resource management","Production"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Volume Compression","Compressed Volume Rendering","Transform Coding","Hardware-accelerated Volume Rendering"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70580","title":"Multi-Level Graph Layout on the GPU","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":75,"volume":"13","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Technion, Israel Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37646534300","id":37646534300,"full_name":"Yaniv Frishman","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Technion, Israel Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37337567000","id":37337567000,"full_name":"Ayellet Tal","author_order":2}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"This paper presents a new algorithm for force directed graph layout on the GPU.

Recently, significant emphasis has been placed on focus+context (F+C) techniques (e.g., fisheye views and magnification lens) for data exploration in addition to viewing transformation and hierarchical navigation. However, most of the existing data exploration techniques rely on the manipulation of viewing attributes of the rendering system or optical attributes of the data objects, with users being passive viewers. In this paper, we propose a more active approach to data exploration, which attempts to mimic how we would explore data if we were able to hold it and interact with it in our hands. This involves allowing the users to physically or actively manipulate the geometry of a data object. While this approach has been traditionally used in applications, such as surgical simulation, where the original geometry of the data objects is well understood by the users, there are several challenges when this approach is generalized for applications, such as flow and information visualization, where there is no common perception as to the normal or natural geometry of a data object. We introduce a taxonomy and a set of transformations especially for illustrative deformation of general data exploration. We present combined geometric or optical illustration operators for focus+context visualization, and examine the best means for preventing the deformed context from being misperceived. We demonstrated the feasibility of this generalization with examples of flow, information and video visualization.","article_number":"4376157","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376157","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376157/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376157/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4376125,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","start_page":"1320","end_page":"1327","citing_paper_count":25,"citing_patent_count":1,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Focusing","Cognitive science","Silver","Surgery","Information geometry","Geometrical optics","Taxonomy","Lenses","Navigation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Volume deformation","focus+context visualization","interaction techniques"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70587","title":"Tile-based level of detail for the parallel age","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":78,"volume":"13","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"NVIDIA Corporation","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945343600","id":37945343600,"full_name":"Krzysztof Niski","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275763600","id":37275763600,"full_name":"Jonathan D.

We demonstrate our approach on parallel configurations consisting of both single PCs and a cluster of PCs.","article_number":"4376161","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376161","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376161/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376161/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4376125,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","start_page":"1352","end_page":"1359","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":1,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Displays","Personal communication networks","Load management","Rendering (computer graphics)","Parallel processing","Graphics","Resource management","Power system management","Computational geometry"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Level of detail","out-of-core","distributed","parallel","geometry image"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70550","title":"CoViCAD: Comprehensive Visualization of Coronary Artery Disease","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":79,"volume":"13","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, Vienna University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869997400","id":37869997400,"full_name":"Maurice Termeer","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Philips Medical Systems","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086889017","id":37086889017,"full_name":"Javier Olivan Bescos","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Philips Medical Systems","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37374875300","id":37374875300,"full_name":"Marcel Breeuwer","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Eindhoven University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282551500","id":37282551500,"full_name":"Anna Vilanova","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"Philips Medical Systems","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37374887400","id":37374887400,"full_name":"Frans Gerritsen","author_order":5},{"affiliation":"Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, Vienna University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284271200","id":37284271200,"full_name":"Eduard Gr??ller","author_order":6}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present novel, comprehensive visualization techniques for the diagnosis of patients with coronary artery disease using segmented cardiac MRI data.

Commonly this mapping is specified by a transfer function. The specification of transfer functions is a complex task and requires expert knowledge about the underlying rendering technique. In the case of multiple volumetric attributes and multiple visual styles the specification of the multi-dimensional transfer function becomes more challenging and non-intuitive. We present a novel methodology for the specification of a mapping from several volumetric attributes to multiple illustrative visual styles. We introduce semantic layers that allow a domain expert to specify the mapping in the natural language of the domain. A semantic layer defines the mapping of volumetric attributes to one visual style. Volumetric attributes and visual styles are represented as fuzzy sets. The mapping is specified by rules that are evaluated with fuzzy logic arithmetics. The user specifies the fuzzy sets and the rules without special knowledge about the underlying rendering technique. Semantic layers allow for a linguistic specification of the mapping from attributes to visual styles replacing the traditional transfer function specification.","article_number":"4376159","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376159","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376159/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376159/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4376125,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","start_page":"1336","end_page":"1343","citing_paper_count":44,"citing_patent_count":10,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Transfer functions","Fuzzy sets","Fuzzy logic","Natural languages","Arithmetic","Visualization","Rendering (computer graphics)","User interfaces","Focusing","Density measurement"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Illustrative Visualization","Focus+Context Techniques","Volume Visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70586","title":"Registration Techniques for Using Imperfect and Par tially Calibrated Devices in Planar Multi-Projector Displays","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":81,"volume":"13","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of California, Irvine","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37828782600","id":37828782600,"full_name":"Ezekiel Bhasker","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"University of California, Irvine","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37927188200","id":37927188200,"full_name":"Ray Juang","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"University of California, Irvine","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37408075400","id":37408075400,"full_name":"Aditi Majumder","author_order":3}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Multi-projector displays today are automatically registered, both geometrically and photometrically, using cameras. Existing registration techniques assume pre-calibrated projectors and cameras that are devoid of imperfections such as lens distortion. In practice, however, these devices are usually imperfect and uncalibrated. Registration of each of these devices is often more challenging than the multi-projector display registration itself. To make tiled projection-based displays accessible to a layman user we should allow the use of uncalibrated inexpensive devices that are prone to imperfections. In this paper, we make two important advances in this direction. First, we present a new geometric registration technique that can achieve geometric alignment in the presence of severe projector lens distortion using a relatively inexpensive low-resolution camera. This is achieved via a closed-form model that relates the projectors to cameras, in planar multi-projector displays, using rational Bezier patches. This enables us to geometrically calibrate a 3000 times 2500 resolution planar multi-projector display made of 3 times 3 array of nine severely distorted projectors using a low resolution (640 times 480) VGA camera. Second, we present a photometric self-calibration technique for a projector-camera pair. This allows us to photometrically calibrate the same display made of nine projectors using a photometrically uncalibrated camera. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that allows geometrically imperfect projectors and photometrically uncalibrated cameras in calibrating multi-projector displays.","article_number":"4376163","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376163","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=4376163","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376163/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4376125,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","start_page":"1368","end_page":"1375","citing_paper_count":23,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Displays","Photometry","Cameras","Lenses","Calibration","Educational institutions","Visualization","Rendering (computer graphics)","Collaborative work","Laboratories"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Geometric calibration","photometric calibration","tiled displays"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70518","title":"Uncertainty Visualization in Medical Volume Rendering Using Probabilistic Animation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":82,"volume":"13","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Center for Medical Image Science and Visualization (CMIV), Link¨oping University, and Sectra-Imtec AB","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284209100","id":37284209100,"full_name":"Claes Lundström","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Division for Visual Information Technology and Applications (VITA), Link¨oping University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284208400","id":37284208400,"full_name":"Patric Ljung","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Center for Medical Image Science and Visualization (CMIV), Link¨oping University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604521200","id":37604521200,"full_name":"Anders Persson","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Division for Visual Information Technology and Applications (VITA), Link¨oping University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284192000","id":37284192000,"full_name":"Anders Ynnerman","author_order":4}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Direct volume rendering has proved to be an effective visualization method for medical data sets and has reached wide-spread clinical use. The diagnostic exploration, in essence, corresponds to a tissue classification task, which is often complex and time-consuming. Moreover, a major problem is the lack of information on the uncertainty of the classification, which can have dramatic consequences for the diagnosis. In this paper this problem is addressed by proposing animation methods to convey uncertainty in the rendering. The foundation is a probabilistic Transfer Function model which allows for direct user interaction with the classification. The rendering is animated by sampling the probability domain over time, which results in varying appearance for uncertain regions. A particularly promising application of this technique is a \"sensitivity lens\" applied to focus regions in the data set. The methods have been evaluated by radiologists in a study simulating the clinical task of stenosis assessment, in which the animation technique is shown to outperform traditional rendering in terms of assessment accuracy.","article_number":"4376198","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376198","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376198/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376198/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4376125,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","start_page":"1648","end_page":"1655","citing_paper_count":77,"citing_patent_count":2,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty","Animation","Data visualization","Biomedical imaging","Medical diagnostic imaging","Transfer functions","Focusing","Computed tomography","Sampling methods","Medical simulation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty","probability","medical visualization","volume rendering","transfer function"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70537","title":"AdaptiviTree: Adaptive Tree Visualization for Tournament-Style Brackets","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":83,"volume":"13","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Microsoft Res., Redmond","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37955052000","id":37955052000,"full_name":"Desney Tan","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Res., Redmond","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37960251500","id":37960251500,"full_name":"Greg Smith","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Res., Redmond","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37293389400","id":37293389400,"full_name":"Bongshin Lee","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Res., Redmond","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37448060300","id":37448060300,"full_name":"George Robertson","author_order":4}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Online pick'em games, such as the recent NCAA college basketball March Madness tournament, form a large and rapidly growing industry. In these games, players make predictions on a tournament bracket that defines which competitors play each other and how they proceed toward a single champion. Throughout the course of the tournament, players monitor the brackets to track progress and to compare predictions made by multiple players. This is often a complex sense making task. The classic bracket visualization was designed for use on paper and utilizes an incrementally additive system in which the winner of each match-up is rewritten in the next round as the tournament progresses. Unfortunately, this representation requires a significant amount of space and makes it relatively difficult to get a quick overview of the tournament state since competitors take arbitrary paths through the static bracket. In this paper, we present AdaptiviTree, a novel visualization that adaptively deforms the representation of the tree and uses its shape to convey outcome information. AdaptiviTree not only provides a more compact and understandable representation, but also allows overlays that display predictions as well as other statistics. We describe results from a lab study we conducted to explore the efficacy of AdaptiviTree, as well as from a deployment of the system in a recent real-world sports tournament.","article_number":"4376130","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376130","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376130/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376130/","publication_title":"IEEE
