The goal of this project is a validated computation capability to model the full hydrodynamics around a surface combatant including all of the processes that affect mission and performance. Visualization of these large-scale simulations is paramount to understanding the complex physics involved. These simulations produce enormous data sets with both surface and volumetric qualities. Wave breaking, spray sheets, and air entertainment can be visualized using isosurfaces of scalar data. Visualization of quantities such as the vorticity field also provides insight into the dynamics of droplet and bubble formation.

The transfer function has two limitations. First, the user must define curves based on histogram and value rather than seeing and working with the volume itself. Second, the transfer function is inflexible in classifying regions of interest, where values at a voxel such as intensity and gradient are used to differentiate material, not talking into account additional properties such as texture and position. We describe an intuitive user interface for specifying the classification functions that consists of the users painting directly on sample slices of the volume. These painted regions are used to automatically define high-dimensional classification functions that can be implemented in hardware for interactive rendering. The classification of the volume is iteratively improved as the user paints samples, allowing intuitive and efficient viewing of materials of interest.","article_number":"1250413","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1250413","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250413/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250413/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2003.

The method is based on insertion, advection, and decay of dye. To this aim, we extend the texture-based IBFV technique presented by van Wijk (2001) for 2D flow visualization in two main directions. First, we decompose the 3D flow visualization problem in a series of 2D instances of the mentioned IBFV technique. This makes our method benefit from the hardware acceleration the original IBFV technique introduced. Secondly, we extend the concept of advected gray value (or color) noise by introducing opacity (or matter) noise. This allows us to produce sparse 3D noise pattern advections, thus address the occlusion problem inherent to 3D flow visualization. Overall, the presented method delivers interactively animated 3D flow, uses only standard OpenGL 1.1 calls and 2D textures, and is simple to understand and implement.","article_number":"1250377","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1250377","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250377/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250377/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2003.

The algorithm restricts user motion in certain directions by incrementally moving a proxy point along the axes of a local reference frame. Reaction forces are generated by a spring coupler between the proxy and the data probe, which can be tuned to the capabilities of the haptic interface. Secondary haptic effects including field forces, friction, and texture can be easily incorporated to convey information about additional characteristics of the data.

To maintain the stability and efficiency of the Internet, every effort must be made to protect it against various forms of attacks, malicious users, and errors. A key component in the Internet security effort is the routine examination of Internet routing data, which unfortunately can be too large and complicated to browse directly. We have developed an interactive visualization process which proves to be very effective for the analysis of Internet routing data. In this application paper, we show how each step in the visualization process helps direct the analysis and glean insights from the data. These insights include the discovery of patterns, detection of faults and abnormal events, understanding of event correlations, formation of causation hypotheses, and classification of anomalies. We also discuss lessons learned in our visual analysis study.","article_number":"1250415","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1250415","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250415/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250415/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2003.

In this paper, we propose a compression scheme for static and time-varying volumetric data sets based on vector quantization that allows us to circumvent this limitation. We describe a hierarchical quantization scheme that is based on a multiresolution covariance analysis of the original field. This allows for the efficient encoding of large-scale data sets, yet providing a mechanism to exploit temporal coherence in non-stationary fields. We show, that decoding and rendering the compressed data stream can be done on the graphics chip using programmable hardware. In this way, data transfer between the CPU and the graphics processing unit (GPU) can be minimized thus enabling flexible and memory efficient real-time rendering options. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by demonstrating interactive renditions of Gigabyte data sets at reasonable fidelity on commodity graphics hardware.","article_number":"1250385","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1250385","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250385/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250385/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2003.

Clinically meaningful changes in patient physiology were identified and then mapped to the inherent psychophysical properties of the visualization. A long history of psychophysical research has provided an understanding of the parameters within which the human information processing system is able to detect changes in the size, shape and color of visual objects (Gescheider, 1976, Spence, 1990, and Baird, 1970). These detection thresholds are known as just noticeable differences (JNDs) which characterize the amount of change in an object's attribute that is recognizable 50% of the time. A prototype version of the display has been demonstrated to facilitate anesthesiologist's performance while reducing cognitive workload during simulated cardiac events (Agutter et al., 2002). In order to further improve the utility of the new cardiovascular visualization, the clinically relevant changes in cardiovascular variables are mapped to noticeable perceptual changes in the representational elements of the display. The results of the method described in this paper are used to merge information from the psychophysical properties of the cardiovascular visualization, with clinically relevant changes in the patient's cardiovascular physiology as measured by the clinical meaningfulness questionnaire. The result of this combination will create a visualization that is sensitive to changes in the cardiovascular health of the patient and communicates this information to the user in a meaningful, salient and intuitive manner.","article_number":"1250352","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1250352","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250352/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250352/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2003.

In both stages we propose techniques to increase the filtering performance. The vertex program pre-computes texture coordinates in order to address all contributing input samples of the operator mask. Thus additional computations are avoided in the fragment program. The presented fragment programs preserve cache coherence, exploit 4D vector arithmetic, and internal fixed point arithmetic to increase performance.

Unfortunately, existing algorithms do not scale well when parallelized, and require full re-computation whenever the opacity transfer function is modified. To address these issues, we have designed a Plenoptic Opacity Function (POF) scheme to encode the view-dependent opacity of a volume block. POFs are computed off-line during a pre-processing stage, only once for each block. We show that using POFs is (i) an efficient, conservative and effective way to encode the opacity variations of a volume block for a range of views, (ii) flexible for re-use by a family of opacity transfer functions without the need for additional off-line processing, and (iii) highly scalable for use in massively parallel implementations. Our results confirm the efficacy of POFs for visibility culling in large-scale parallel volume rendering; we can interactively render the Visible Woman dataset using software ray-casting on 32 processors, with interactive modification of the opacity transfer function on-the-fly.","article_number":"1250391","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1250391","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250391/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250391/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2003.

It can reconstruct thin features without creating handles and results in improved surface extraction from volumetric data. Our subdivision algorithm takes into account sharp features that arise from intersecting surfaces or Boolean operations and generates an adaptive grid such that each voxel has at most one sharp feature. The subdivision algorithm is combined with our improved reconstruction algorithm to compute accurate polygonization of Boolean combinations or offsets of complex primitives that faithfully reconstruct the sharp features.

LightKit simplifies the task of producing visually pleasing, easily interpretable images for visualization while making it harder to produce results where the scene illumination distracts from the visualization process. LightKit is based on lighting designs developed by artists and photographers and shown in previous studies to enhance shape perception. A key light provides natural overhead illumination of the scene, augmented by fill, head, and back lights. By default, lights are attached to a normalized, subject-centric, camera-relative coordinate frame to ensure consistent lighting independent of camera location or orientation. This system allows all lights to be positioned by specifying just six parameters. The intensity of each light is specified as a ratio to the key light intensity, allowing the scene's brightness to be adjusted using a single parameter. The color of each light is specified by a single normalized color parameter called warmth that is based on color temperature of natural sources. LightKit's default values for light position, intensity, and color are chosen to produce good results for a variety of scenes. LightKit is designed to work with both hardware graphics systems and, potentially, higher quality off-line rendering systems.

Triangle meshes are considered for the representation of a two-dimensional manifold and the distance function is sampled on a regular Cartesian grid. In order to achieve linear complexity in the number of grid points, to each primitive we assign a simple polyhedron enclosing its Voronoi cell. Voronoi cells are known to contain exactly all points that lay closest to its corresponding primitive. Thus, the distance to the primitive only has to be computed for grid points inside its polyhedron. Although Voronoi cells partition space, the polyhedrons enclosing these cells do overlap. In regions where these overlaps occur, the minimum of all computed distances is assigned to a grid point. In order to speed up computations, points inside each polyhedron are determined by scan conversion of grid slices using graphics hardware. For this task, a fragment program is used to perform the nonlinear interpolation and minimization of distance values.","article_number":"1250358","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1250358","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250358/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250358/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2003.

In virtual colonoscopy, CT data should be acquired at a low radiation dose that results in a low signal-to-noise ratio. Alternatively, MRI data is acquired without ionizing radiation, but suffers from noise and bias (global signal fluctuations). Current volume visualization techniques often do not produce good results with noisy or biased data. This paper describes methods for volume visualization that deal with these imperfections. The techniques are based on specially adapted edge detectors using first and second order derivative filters. The filtering is integrated into the visualization process.

This allows the user to see hidden parts of the data, but has the disadvantage of removing potentially important surrounding contextual information. We explore an alternate strategy for browsing that uses deformations, where the user can cut into and open up, spread apart, or peel away parts of the volume in real time, making the interior visible while still retaining surrounding context. We consider various deformation strategies and present a number of interaction techniques based on different metaphors. Our designs pay special attention to the semantic layers that might compose a volume (e.g. the skin, muscle, bone in a scan of a human). Users can apply deformations to only selected layers, or apply a given deformation to a different degree to each layer, making browsing more flexible and facilitating the visualization of relationships between layers. Our interaction techniques are controlled with direct, \"in place\" manipulation, using pop-up menus and 3D widgets, to avoid the divided attention and awkwardness that would come with panels of traditional widgets. Initial user feedback indicates that our techniques are valuable, especially for showing portions of the data spatially situated in context with surrounding data.","article_number":"1250400","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1250400","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250400/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250400/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2003.

On each tetra-hedron of /spl Delta/ , the quasi-interpolating spline is a polynomial of total degree two which provides several advantages including efficient computation, evaluation and visualization of the model. We apply Bernstein-Bezier techniques well-known in CAGD to compute and evaluate the trivariate spline and its gradient. With this approach the volume data can be visualized efficiently e.g., with isosurface ray-casting. Along an arbitrary ray the splines are univariate, piecewise quadratics and thus the exact intersection for a prescribed isovalue can be easily determined in an analytic and exact way.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid segmentation method which is based on a pipeline of three segmentation stages to extract the lower airways down to the seventh generation of the bronchi. User interaction is limited to the specification of a seed point inside the easily detectable trachea at the upper end of the lower airways. Similarly, the complementary vascular tree of the lungs can be segmented.

Therefore, in many visualization applications a scalar density corresponding to the point distribution is resampled on a regular grid for direct volume rendering. However, many fine details are usually lost for voxel resolutions which still allow interactive visualization on standard workstations. Since no surface geometry is associated with our data sets, the recently introduced point-based rendering algorithms cannot be applied as well. In this paper we propose to accelerate the visualization of scattered point data by a hierarchical data structure based on a PCA clustering procedure. By traversing this structure for each frame we can trade-off rendering speed vs. image quality. Our scheme also reduces memory consumption by using quantized relative coordinates and it allows for fast sorting of semi-transparent clusters. We analyze various software and hardware implementations of our renderer and demonstrate that we can now visualize data sets with tens of millions of points interactively with sub-pixel screen space error on current PC graphics hardware employing advanced vertex shader functionality.","article_number":"1250404","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1250404","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250404/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250404/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2003.

For this, a multiplication of vectors is necessary. Clifford algebra provides such a multiplication of vectors. We define a Clifford convolution on vector fields with uniform grids. The Clifford convolution works with multivector filter masks. Scalar and vector masks can be easily converted to multivector fields. So, filter masks from image processing on scalar fields can be applied as well as vector and scalar masks. Furthermore, a method for pattern matching with Clifford convolution on vector fields is described. The method is independent of the direction of the structures. This provides an automatic approach to feature detection. The features can be visualized using any known method like glyphs, isosurfaces or streamlines. The features are defined by filter masks instead of analytical properties and thus the approach is more intuitive.","article_number":"1250372","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1250372","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250372/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250372/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2003.

As a result of a preprocessing, a point cloud of random samples is generated using a normalized continuous reconstruction of the volume as a probability density function. This point cloud is projected onto the image plane, and to each pixel an intensity value is assigned which is proportional to the number of samples projected onto the corresponding pixel area. In such a way a simulated X-ray image of the volume can be obtained. Theoretically, for a fixed image resolution, there exists an M number of samples such that the average standard deviation of the estimated pixel intensities us under the level of quantization error regardless of the number of voxels. Therefore Monte Carlo Volume Rendering (MCVR) is mainly proposed to efficiently visualize large volume data sets. Furthermore, network applications are also supported, since the trade-off between image quality and interactivity can be adapted to the bandwidth of the client/server connection by using progressive refinement.","article_number":"1250406","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1250406","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250406/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250406/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2003.

In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm to track time-varying isosurfaces and interval volumes using isosurfacing in higher dimensions. Instead of extracting the data features such as isosurfaces or interval volumes separately from multiple time steps and computing the spatial correspondence between those features, our algorithm extracts the correspondence directly from the higher dimensional geometry and thus can more efficiently follow the user selected local features in time. In addition, by analyzing the resulting higher dimensional geometry, it becomes easier to detect important topological events and the corresponding critical time steps for the selected features. With our algorithm, the user can interact with the underlying time-varying data more easily. The computation cost for performing time-varying volume tracking is also minimized.","article_number":"1250374","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1250374","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250374/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250374/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2003.

We believe that this processing concept will also prove useful for other tasks, such a parameterization, remeshing, or smoothing, for which currently only in-core solutions exist. A processing sequence represents a mesh as a particular interleaved ordering of indexed triangles and vertices. This representation allows streaming very large meshes through main memory while maintaining information about the visitation status of edges and vertices. At any time, only a small portion of the mesh is kept in-core, with the bulk of the mesh data residing on disk. Mesh access is restricted to a fixed traversal order, but full connectivity and geometry information is available for the active elements of the traversal. This provides seamless and highly efficient out-of-core access to very large meshes for algorithms that can adapt their computations to this fixed ordering. The two abstractions that are naturally supported by this representation are boundary-based and buffer-based processing. We illustrate both abstractions by adapting two different simplification methods to perform their computation using a prototype of our mesh processing sequence API. Both algorithms benefit from using processing sequences in terms of improved quality, more efficient execution, and smaller memory footprints.","article_number":"1250408","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1250408","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250408/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250408/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2003.

A central element of volume rendering is the conversion between data values and observable quantities such as color and opacity. This process is usually realized through the use of transfer functions that are precomputed and stored in lookup tables. For multidimensional transfer functions applied to multivariate data, these lookup tables become prohibitively large. We propose the direct evaluation of a particular type of transfer functions based on a sum of Gaussians. Because of their simple form (in terms of number of parameters), these functions and their analytic integrals along line segments can be evaluated efficiently on current graphics hardware, obviating the need for precomputed lookup tables. We have adopted these transfer functions because they are well suited for classification based on a unique combination of multiple data values that localize features in the transfer function domain. We apply this technique to the visualization of several multivariate datasets (CT, cryosection) that are difficult to classify and render accurately at interactive rates using traditional approaches.","article_number":"1250412","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1250412","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250412/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250412/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2003.

This paper proposes to use particular stream lines called saddle connectors instead of separating stream surfaces and to depict single surfaces only on user demand. We discuss properties and computational issues of saddle connectors and apply these methods to complex flow data. We show that the use of saddle connectors makes topological skeletons available as a valuable visualization tool even for topologically complex 3D flow data.","article_number":"1250376","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1250376","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250376/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250376/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2003.

The distance field is generated from a specific shell volume that rapidly creates narrow spatial bands around the virtual surface of any given isovalue.

In rigid-body motion cases, we replace a time-series of meshes with a transformed mesh object where a reference mesh is dynamically transformed based on a given time value in order to satisfy geometry requests, on demand. The data model enables us to make these substitutions and dynamic transformations transparently with respect to the visualization algorithms.

However, despite these benefits one important issue has received little attention throughout the ongoing discussion of texture based volume rendering: the integration of acceleration techniques to reduce per-fragment operations. In this paper, we address the integration of early ray termination and empty-space skipping into texture based volume rendering on graphical processing units (GPU). Therefore, we describe volume ray-casting on programmable graphics hardware as an alternative to object-order approaches. We exploit the early z-test to terminate fragment processing once sufficient opacity has been accumulated, and to skip empty space along the rays of sight. We demonstrate performance gains up to a factor of 3 for typical renditions of volumetric data sets on the ATI 9700 graphics card.","article_number":"1250384","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1250384","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250384/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250384/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2003.

We propose to generalize the concept of planar section to the extraction of curved cross-sections (free form surfaces). Compared with planar slices, curved cross-sections may easily follow the trajectory of tubular structures and organs such as the aorta or the colon. They may be extracted from a 3D volume, displayed as a 3D view and possibly flattened. Flattening of curved cross-sections allows to inspect spatially complex relationship between anatomic structures and their neighborhood. They also allow to carry out measurements along a specific orientation. For the purpose of facilitating the interactive specification of free form surfaces, users may navigate in real time within the body and select the slices on which the surface control points will be positioned. Immediate feedback is provided by displaying boundary curves as cylindrical markers within a 3D view composed of anatomic organs, planar slices and possibly free form surface sections. Extraction of curved surface sections is an additional service that is available online as a Java applet (http://visiblehuman.epfl.ch).

The first challenge was managing the enormous complexity of the scene to fit within the limits of state-of-the art simulation software systems and supercomputing resources. The second challenge was to integrate the simulation results into a high-quality visualization. To meet this challenge, we implemented a custom importer that simplifies and loads the massive simulation data in a commercial animation system. The surrounding scene is modeled using image-based techniques and is also imported in the animation system where the visualization is produced. A specific issue for us was to federate the simulation and the animation systems, both commercial systems not under our control and following internally different conceptualizations of geometry and animation. This had to be done such that scalability was achieved. The reusable link created between the two systems allows communicating the results to non-specialists and the public at large, as well as facilitating communication in teams with members having diverse technical backgrounds.","article_number":"1250422","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1250422","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250422/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250422/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2003.

We show how segmented data sets can be rendered interactively on current consumer graphics hardware with high image quality and pixel-resolution filtering of object boundaries. In order to enhance object perception, we employ different levels of object distinction. First, each object can be assigned an individual transfer function, multiple of which can be applied in a single rendering pass. Second, different rendering modes such as direct volume rendering, iso-surfacing, and non-photorealistic techniques can be selected for each object. A minimal number of rendering passes is achieved by processing sets of objects that share the same rendering mode in a single pass. Third, local compositing modes such as alpha blending and MIP can be selected for each object in addition to a single global mode, thus enabling high-quality two-level volume rendering on GPUs.","article_number":"1250386","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1250386","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250386/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250386/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2003.

We partition the volume into sub-volumes, each containing voxels with similar properties. Sub-volumes composed of only voxels mapped to empty by the transfer function are skipped. To render the adaptively partitioned sub-volumes in visibility order, we reorganize them into an orthogonal BSP tree. We also present an algorithm that computes incrementally the intersection of the volume with the slicing planes, which avoids the overhead of the intersection and texture coordinates computation introduced by the partitioning. Rendering with empty space skipping is 2 to 5 times faster than without it. To skip occluded voxels, we introduce the concept of orthogonal opacity map, that simplifies the transformation between the volume coordinates and the opacity map coordinates, which is intensively used for occlusion detection. The map is updated efficiently by the GPU. The sub-volumes are then culled and clipped against the opacity map. We also present a method that adaptively adjusts the optimal number of the opacity map updates. With occlusion clipping, about 60% of non-empty voxels can be skipped and an additional 80% speedup on average is gained for iso-surface-like rendering.","article_number":"1250388","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1250388","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250388/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250388/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2003.

Our system uses a novel compositing process in which images are combined using spatially-varying light mattes, enabling the final lighting in each area of the composite to be manipulated independently.

Their usefulness has been limited, however, by their high computational cost and reliance on significant parameter tuning. This paper presents a solution to these challenges by describing graphics processor (GPU) based on algorithms for solving and visualizing level-set solutions at interactive rates. Our efficient GPU-based solution relies on packing the level-set isosurface data into a dynamic, sparse texture format. As the level set moves, this sparse data structure is updated via a novel GPU to CPU message passing scheme. When the level-set solver is integrated with a real-time volume renderer operating on the same packed format, a user can visualize and steer the deformable level-set surface as it evolves. In addition, the resulting isosurface can serve as a region-of-interest specifier for the volume renderer. This paper demonstrates the capabilities of this technology for interactive volume visualization and segmentation.","article_number":"1250357","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1250357","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250357/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250357/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2003.

UFAC is derived from a generic framework that provides spacetime-coherent dense representations of time dependent-vector fields by a two-step process: 1) construction of continuous trajectories in spacetime for temporal coherence; and 2) convolution along another set of paths through the above spacetime for spatially correlated patterns. Within the framework, known visualization techniques-such as Lagrangian-Eulerian advection, image-based flow visualization, unsteady flow LIC, and dynamic LIC-can be reproduced, often with better image quality, higher performance, or increased flexibility of the visualization style. Finally, we present a texture-based discretization of the framework and its interactive implementation on graphics hardware, which allows the user to gradually balance visualization speed against quality.","article_number":"1250361","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1250361","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250361/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250361/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2003.

How 2D and 3D views are displayed affects ease of mental registration (understanding the spatial relationship between views), an important factor influencing user performance. This paper compares the above methods in terms of their ability to support mental registration. Empirical results show that mental registration is significantly easier with in-place displays than with ExoVis, and significantly easier with ExoVis than with orientation icons. Different mental transformation strategies can explain this result.

The conversion process retains the original frequency characteristics of the dataset by matching the spatial distribution of sample points with the required frequency. To achieve good blending, the spherical points commonly used in volume rendering are generalized to ellipsoidal point primitives. A family of multiresolution, oriented Gabor wavelets provide the frequency-space analysis of the dataset. The outcome of this frequency analysis is the reduced set of points, in which the sampling rate is decreased in originally oversampled areas. During rendering, the traversal of the hierarchy can be controlled by any suitable error metric or quality criteria. The local level of refinement is also sensitive to the transfer function. Areas with density ranges mapped to high transfer function variability are rendered at higher point resolution than others. Our decomposition is flexible and can be used for iso-surface rendering, alpha compositing and X-ray rendering of volumes. We demonstrate our hierarchy with an interactive splatting volume renderer, in which the traversal of the point hierarchy for rendering is modulated by a user-specified frame rate.","article_number":"1250403","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1250403","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250403/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250403/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2003.

The 2D or 3D O-buffer is in essence a conventional image or a volume, respectively, except that samples are not restricted to a regular grid. A sample position in the O-buffer is recorded as an offset to the nearest grid point of a regular base grid (hence the name O-buffer). The offset is typically quantized for compact representation and efficient rendering. The O-buffer emancipates pixels and voxels from the regular grids and can greatly improve the modeling power of images and volumes. It is a semi-regular structure which lends itself to efficient construction and rendering. Image quality can be improved by storing more spatial information with samples and by avoiding multiple resamplings and delaying reconstruction to the final rendering stage. Using O-buffers, more accurate multi-resolution representations can be developed for images and volumes. It can also be exploited to represent and render unstructured primitives, such as points, particles, curvilinear or irregular volumes. The O-buffer is therefore a uniform representation for a variety of graphics primitives and supports mixing them in the same scene. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the O-buffer with hierarchical O-buffers, layered depth O-buffers, and hybrid volume rendering with O-buffers.","article_number":"1250405","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1250405","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250405/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250405/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2003.

We employ our meta-cell technique to explore the spatial coherence of the data, and our time tree algorithm to consider the temporal coherence as well. Our one-time preprocessing phase first partitions the dataset into meta-cells that cluster spatially neighboring cells together and are stored in disk. We then build a time tree to index the meta-cells for fast isosurface extraction. The time tree takes advantage of the temporal coherence among the scalar values at different time steps, and uses BBIO trees as secondary structures, which are stored in disk and support I/O-optimal interval searches. The time tree algorithm employs a novel meta-interval collapsing scheme and the buffer technique, to take care of the temporal coherence in an I/O-efficient way. We further make the time tree cache-oblivious, so that searching on it automatically performs optimal number of block transfers between any two consecutive levels of memory hierarchy (such as between cache and main memory and between main memory and disk) simultaneously. At run-time, we perform optimal cache-oblivious searches in the time tree, together with I/O-optimal searches in the BBIO trees, to read the active meta-cells from disk and generate the queried isosurface efficiently. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our new technique. In particular, compared with the query-optimal main-memory algorithm by Cignoni et al. (1997) (extended for time-varying fields) when there is not enough main memory, our technique can speed up the isosurface queries from more than 18 hours to less than 4 minutes.","article_number":"1250375","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1250375","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250375/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250375/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2003.
