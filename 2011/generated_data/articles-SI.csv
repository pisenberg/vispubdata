"The field of visualization has addressed navigation of very large datasets, usually meshes and volumes. Significantly less attention has been devoted to the issues surrounding navigation of very large images. In the last few years the explosive growth in the resolution of camera sensors and robotic image acquisition techniques has widened the gap between the display and image resolutions to three orders of magnitude or more. This paper presents the first steps towards navigation of very large images, particularly landscape images, from an interactive visualization perspective. The grand challenge in navigation of very large images is identifying regions of potential interest. In this paper we outline a three-step approach. In the first step we use multi-scale saliency to narrow down the potential areas of interest. In the second step we outline a method based on statistical signatures to further cull out regions of high conformity. In the final step we allow a user to interactively identify the exceptional regions of high interest that merit further attention. We show that our approach of progressive elicitation is fast and allows rapid identification of regions of interest. Unlike previous work in this area, our approach is scalable and computationally reasonable on very large images. We validate the results of our approach by comparing them to user-tagged regions of interest on several very large landscape images from the Internet.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064936/","LOCKED","6064936","Department of Computer Science and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, USA","","Department of Computer Science and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586231900","1","Cheuk Yiu Ip","37586231900","Department of Computer Science and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, USA","Department of Computer Science and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282560200","2","Amitabh Varshney","37282560200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","26","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.231","687","1746","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064936/","Image Saliency","Very Large Scale Images","Scene Perception","Interactive Visualization","Anomaly Detection","Guided Interaction.","","","","Data visualization","Image color analysis","Navigation","Image resolution","","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064936","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","10","1737","Saliency-Assisted Navigation of Very Large Landscape Images","17"
"Video storyboard, which is a form of video visualization, summarizes the major events in a video using illustrative visualization. There are three main technical challenges in creating a video storyboard, (a) event classification, (b) event selection and (c) event illustration. Among these challenges, (a) is highly application-dependent and requires a significant amount of application specific semantics to be encoded in a system or manually specified by users. This paper focuses on challenges (b) and (c). In particular, we present a framework for hierarchical event representation, and an importance-based selection algorithm for supporting the creation of a video storyboard from a video. We consider the storyboard to be an event summarization for the whole video, whilst each individual illustration on the board is also an event summarization but for a smaller time window. We utilized a 3D visualization template for depicting and annotating events in illustrations. To demonstrate the concepts and algorithms developed, we use Snooker video visualization as a case study, because it has a concrete and agreeable set of semantic definitions for events and can make use of existing techniques of event detection and 3D reconstruction in a reliable manner. Nevertheless, most of our concepts and algorithms developed for challenges (b) and (c) can be applied to other application areas.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064937/","LOCKED","6064937","Department of Computer Science, the College of Science, and the College of Engineering, Swansea University, UK","","Department of Computer Science, the College of Science, and the College of Engineering, Swansea University, UK","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38030607100","1","Matthew L.

"As microscopes have a very shallow depth of field, Z-stacks (i.e. sets of images shot at different focal planes) are often acquired to fully capture a thick sample. Such stacks are viewed by users by navigating them through the mouse wheel. We propose a new technique of visualizing 3D point, line or area markers in such focus stacks, by displaying them with a depth-dependent defocus, simulating the microscope's optics; this leverages on the microscopists' ability to continuously twiddle focus, while implicitly performing a shape-from-focus reconstruction of the 3D structure of the sample. User studies confirm that the approach is effective, and can complement more traditional techniques such as color-based cues. We provide two implementations, one of which computes defocus in real time on the GPU, and examples of their application.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064938/","LOCKED","6064938","Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Ingelligence (IDSIA) and SUPSI, Lugano, Switzerland","","Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Ingelligence (IDSIA) and SUPSI, Lugano, Switzerland","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38498058400","1","Alessandro Giusti","38498058400","Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, Ispra, Italy","Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, Ispra, Italy","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591225000","2","Pierluigi Taddei","37591225000","International Institute for Reproductive Medicine, Lugano, Switzerland","International Institute for Reproductive Medicine, Lugano, Switzerland","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37972936000","3","Giorgio Corani","37972936000","Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Ingelligence (IDSIA) and SUPSI, Lugano, Switzerland","Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Ingelligence (IDSIA) and SUPSI, Lugano, Switzerland","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37270036000","4","Luca Gambardella","37270036000","Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Ingelligence (IDSIA) and SUPSI, Lugano, Switzerland","Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Ingelligence (IDSIA) and SUPSI, Lugano, Switzerland","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37988921000","5","Cristina Magli","37988921000","SISMeR, Italy","SISMeR, Italy","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37972814500","6","Luca Gianaroli","37972814500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4","3","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.168","528","1764","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064938/","Depth of field","Microscopy","Focus stacks.","","","","","","","Microscopy","Three dimensional displays","Data visualization","Optical microscopy","Image color analysis","Image segmentation","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064938","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","12","1757","Artificial Defocus for Displaying Markers in Microscopy Z-Stacks","17"
"Area-preserving maps are found across a wide range of scientific and engineering problems. Their study is made challenging by the significant computational effort typically required for their inspection but more fundamentally by the fractal complexity of salient structures. The visual inspection of these maps reveals a remarkable topological picture consisting of fixed (or periodic) points embedded in so-called island chains, invariant manifolds, and regions of ergodic behavior. This paper is concerned with the effective visualization and precise topological analysis of area-preserving maps with two degrees of freedom from numerical or analytical data. Specifically, a method is presented for the automatic extraction and characterization of fixed points and the computation of their invariant manifolds, also known as separatrices, to yield a complete picture of the structures present within the scale and complexity bounds selected by the user. This general approach offers a significant improvement over the visual representations that are so far available for area-preserving maps. The technique is demonstrated on a numerical simulation of magnetic confinement in a fusion reactor.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064939/","LOCKED","6064939","Purdue University, USA","","Purdue University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282575100","1","Xavier Tricoche","37282575100","University of Kaiserslautern, Germany","University of Kaiserslautern, Germany","University of California, Davis, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282573700","2","Christoph Garth","37282573700","SCI Institute, University of Utah, USA","SCI Institute, University of Utah, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283733200","3","Allen Sanderson","37283733200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","19","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.254","498","1774","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064939/","Poincaré map","dynamical systems","topology","chaos","area-preserving maps","invariant manifolds.","","","","Manifolds","Topology","Data visualization","Chaos theory","Fusion reactors","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064939","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","13","1765","Visualization of Topological Structures in Area-Preserving Maps","17"
"Medical imaging plays a central role in a vast range of healthcare practices. The usefulness of 3D visualizations has been demonstrated for many types of treatment planning. Nevertheless, full access to 3D renderings outside of the radiology department is still scarce even for many image-centric specialties. Our work stems from the hypothesis that this under-utilization is partly due to existing visualization systems not taking the prerequisites of this application domain fully into account. We have developed a medical visualization table intended to better fit the clinical reality. The overall design goals were two-fold: similarity to a real physical situation and a very low learning threshold. This paper describes the development of the visualization table with focus on key design decisions. The developed features include two novel interaction components for touch tables. A user study including five orthopedic surgeons demonstrates that the system is appropriate and useful for this application domain.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064940/","LOCKED","6064940","Center for Medical Image Science and Visualization, Linköping University, Sweden","","Center for Medical Image Science and Visualization, Linköping University, Sweden","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284209100","1","Claes Lundstrom","37284209100","Interactive Institute, Norrkoping, Sweden","Interactive Institute, Norrkoping, Sweden","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017009700","2","Thomas Rydell","38017009700","C-research, Linköping University, Sweden","C-research, Linköping University, Sweden","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546939800","3","Camilla Forsell","37546939800","Center for Medical Image Science and Visualization, Linköping University, Sweden","Center for Medical Image Science and Visualization, Linköping University, Sweden","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604521200","4","Anders Persson","37604521200","C-research, Linköping University, Sweden","C-research, Linköping University, Sweden","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284192000","5","Anders Ynnerman","37284192000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","49","2","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.224","1841","1784","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064940/","Medical visualization","multitouch","tabletop display","treatment planning.","","","","","","Three dimensional displays","Surgery","Biomedical image processing","Orthopedic surgery","","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064940","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","14","1775","Multi-Touch Table System for Medical Visualization: Application to Orthopedic Surgery Planning","17"
"Because of the ever increasing size of output data from scientific simulations, supercomputers are increasingly relied upon to generate visualizations. One use of supercomputers is to generate field lines from large scale flow fields. When generating field lines in parallel, the vector field is generally decomposed into blocks, which are then assigned to processors. Since various regions of the vector field can have different flow complexity, processors will require varying amounts of computation time to trace their particles, causing load imbalance, and thus limiting the performance speedup. To achieve load-balanced streamline generation, we propose a workload-aware partitioning algorithm to decompose the vector field into partitions with near equal workloads. Since actual workloads are unknown beforehand, we propose a workload estimation algorithm to predict the workload in the local vector field. A graph-based representation of the vector field is employed to generate these estimates. Once the workloads have been estimated, our partitioning algorithm is hierarchically applied to distribute the workload to all partitions. We examine the performance of our workload estimation and workload-aware partitioning algorithm in several timings studies, which demonstrates that by employing these methods, better scalability can be achieved with little overhead.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064941/","LOCKED","6064941","Ohio State University, USA","","Ohio State University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37570501300","1","Boonthanome Nouanesengsy","37570501300","Ohio State University, USA","Ohio State University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403060100","2","Teng-Yok Lee","37403060100","Ohio State University, USA","Ohio State University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279493500","3","Han-Wei Shen","37279493500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","44","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.219","720","1794","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064941/","Flow visualization","Parallel processing","3D vector field visualization","Streamlines.","","","","","","Partitioning algorithms","Cost function","Mathematical model","","","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064941","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","15","1785","Load-Balanced Parallel Streamline Generation on Large Scale Vector Fields","17"
"Direct volume rendering has become a popular method for visualizing volumetric datasets. Even though computers are continually getting faster, it remains a challenge to incorporate sophisticated illumination models into direct volume rendering while maintaining interactive frame rates. In this paper, we present a novel approach for advanced illumination in direct volume rendering based on GPU ray-casting. Our approach features directional soft shadows taking scattering into account, ambient occlusion and color bleeding effects while achieving very competitive frame rates. In particular, multiple dynamic lights and interactive transfer function changes are fully supported. Commonly, direct volume rendering is based on a very simplified discrete version of the original volume rendering integral, including the development of the original exponential extinction into a-blending. In contrast to a-blending forming a product when sampling along a ray, the original exponential extinction coefficient is an integral and its discretization a Riemann sum. The fact that it is a sum can cleverly be exploited to implement volume lighting effects, i.e. soft directional shadows, ambient occlusion and color bleeding. We will show how this can be achieved and how it can be implemented on the GPU.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064942/","LOCKED","6064942","Visualization and MultiMedia Laboratory, Department of Informatics, University of Zürich, Switzerland","","Visualization and MultiMedia Laboratory, Department of Informatics, University of Zürich, Switzerland","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38026738000","1","Philipp Schlegel","38026738000","Visualization and MultiMedia Laboratory, Department of Informatics, University of Zürich, Switzerland","Visualization and MultiMedia Laboratory, Department of Informatics, University of Zürich, Switzerland","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085546539","2","Maxim Makhinya","37085546539","Visualization and MultiMedia Laboratory, Department of Informatics, University of Zürich, Switzerland","Visualization and MultiMedia Laboratory, Department of Informatics, University of Zürich, Switzerland","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282193800","3","Renato Pajarola","37282193800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","35","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.198","1019","1802","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064942/","Volume Rendering","Shadows","Ambient Occlusion","GPU Ray-Casting","Exponential Extinction.","","","","","Rendering (computer graphics)","Light sources","Scattering","Image color analysis","Graphics processing unit","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064942","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","16","1795","Extinction-Based Shading and Illumination in GPU Volume Ray-Casting","17"
"We present a GPU-based ray-tracing system for the accurate and interactive visualization of cut-surfaces through 3D simulations of physical processes created from spectral/hp high-order finite element methods. When used by the numerical analyst to debug the solver, the ability for the imagery to precisely reflect the data is critical. In practice, the investigator interactively selects from a palette of visualization tools to construct a scene that can answer a query of the data. This is effective as long as the implicit contract of image quality between the individual and the visualization system is upheld. OpenGL rendering of scientific visualizations has worked remarkably well for exploratory visualization for most solver results. This is due to the consistency between the use of first-order representations in the simulation and the linear assumptions inherent in OpenGL (planar fragments and color-space interpolation). Unfortunately, the contract is broken when the solver discretization is of higher-order. There have been attempts to mitigate this through the use of spatial adaptation and/or texture mapping. These methods do a better job of approximating what the imagery should be but are not exact and tend to be view-dependent. This paper introduces new rendering mechanisms that specifically deal with the kinds of native data generated by high-order finite element solvers. The exploratory visualization tools are reassessed and cast in this system with the focus on image accuracy. This is accomplished in a GPU setting to ensure interactivity.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064943/","LOCKED","6064943","School of Computing and the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA","","School of Computing and the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37557887400","1","Blake Nelson","37557887400","Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, MIT, USA","Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, MIT, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275716100","2","Robert M.

"Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is becoming a standard minimally invasive clinical procedure for the treatment of liver tumors. However, planning the applicator placement such that the malignant tissue is completely destroyed, is a demanding task that requires considerable experience. In this work, we present a fast GPU-based real-time approximation of the ablation zone incorporating the cooling effect of liver vessels. Weighted distance fields of varying RF applicator types are derived from complex numerical simulations to allow a fast estimation of the ablation zone. Furthermore, the heat-sink effect of the cooling blood flow close to the applicator's electrode is estimated by means of a preprocessed thermal equilibrium representation of the liver parenchyma and blood vessels. Utilizing the graphics card, the weighted distance field incorporating the cooling blood flow is calculated using a modular shader framework, which facilitates the real-time visualization of the ablation zone in projected slice views and in volume rendering. The proposed methods are integrated in our software assistant prototype for planning RFA therapy. The software allows the physician to interactively place virtual RF applicator models. The real-time visualization of the corresponding approximated ablation zone facilitates interactive evaluation of the tumor coverage in order to optimize the applicator's placement such that all cancer cells are destroyed by the ablation.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064944/","LOCKED","6064944","Fraunhofer MEVIS, Germany","","Fraunhofer MEVIS, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017035400","1","Christian Rieder","38017035400","Fraunhofer MEVIS / CeVis, University of Bremen","Fraunhofer MEVIS / CeVis, University of Bremen","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087415400","2","Tim Kroeger","37087415400","Fraunhofer MEVIS, Germany","Fraunhofer MEVIS, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089038269","3","Christian Schumann","37089038269","Fraunhofer MEVIS, Jacobs University, Bremen, Germany","Fraunhofer MEVIS, Jacobs University, Bremen, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37729702200","4","Horst K.

"We present a new framework for feature-based statistical analysis of large-scale scientific data and demonstrate its effectiveness by analyzing features from Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of turbulent combustion. Turbulent flows are ubiquitous and account for transport and mixing processes in combustion, astrophysics, fusion, and climate modeling among other disciplines. They are also characterized by coherent structure or organized motion, i.e. nonlocal entities whose geometrical features can directly impact molecular mixing and reactive processes. While traditional multi-point statistics provide correlative information, they lack nonlocal structural information, and hence, fail to provide mechanistic causality information between organized fluid motion and mixing and reactive processes. Hence, it is of great interest to capture and track flow features and their statistics together with their correlation with relevant scalar quantities, e.g. temperature or species concentrations. In our approach we encode the set of all possible flow features by pre-computing merge trees augmented with attributes, such as statistical moments of various scalar fields, e.g. temperature, as well as length-scales computed via spectral analysis. The computation is performed in an efficient streaming manner in a pre-processing step and results in a collection of meta-data that is orders of magnitude smaller than the original simulation data. This meta-data is sufficient to support a fully flexible and interactive analysis of the features, allowing for arbitrary thresholds, providing per-feature statistics, and creating various global diagnostics such as Cumulative Density Functions (CDFs), histograms, or time-series. We combine the analysis with a rendering of the features in a linked-view browser that enables scientists to interactively explore, visualize, and analyze the equivalent of one terabyte of simulation data. We highlight the utility of this new framework for combustion science; however, it is applicable to many other science domains.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064945/","LOCKED","6064945","Sandia National Laboratories, USA","","Sandia National Laboratories, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37551867600","1","Janine C.

Therefore this framework allows us to analyze and contrast the sampling-theoretic performance of general lattices, using signal reconstruction, in an unbiased manner. Our quasi interpolation methodology is implemented as an efficient FIR filter that can be applied online or as a preprocessing step. We present visual and numerical experiments that demonstrate the improved accuracy of reconstruction across lattices, using the quasi interpolation framework.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064946/","LOCKED","6064946","University of FLorida","","University of FLorida","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37978593500","1","Mahsa Mirzargar","37978593500","University of Florida","University of Florida","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268675600","2","Alireza Entezari","37268675600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.230","675","1841","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064946/","Voronoi Spline","Quasi Interpolation","Volume Visualization","Box spline.","","","","","","Spline","Interpolation","Convolution","Image reconstruction","","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064946","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","20","1832","Quasi Interpolation With Voronoi Splines","17"
"We present topological spines−a new visual representation that preserves the topological and geometric structure of a scalar field. This representation encodes the spatial relationships of the extrema of a scalar field together with the local volume and nesting structure of the surrounding contours. Unlike other topological representations, such as contour trees, our approach preserves the local geometric structure of the scalar field, including structural cycles that are useful for exposing symmetries in the data. To obtain this representation, we describe a novel mechanism based on the extraction of extremum graphs−sparse subsets of the Morse-Smale complex that retain the important structural information without the clutter and occlusion problems that arise from visualizing the entire complex directly. Extremum graphs form a natural multiresolution structure that allows the user to suppress noise and enhance topological features via the specification of a persistence range. Applications of our approach include the visualization of 3D scalar fields without occlusion artifacts, and the exploratory analysis of high-dimensional functions.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064947/","LOCKED","6064947","Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, USA","","Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282925900","1","Carlos Correa","37282925900","Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, USA","Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37269320000","2","Peter Lindstrom","37269320000","Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, USA","Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564112000","3","Peer-Timo Bremer","37564112000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","38","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.244","1211","1851","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064947/","Scalar field topology","topological spine","extremum graph","Morse-Smale complex.","","","","","","Topology","Data visualization","Approximation methods","Manifolds","","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064947","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","21","1842","Topological Spines: A Structure-preserving Visual Representation of Scalar Fields","17"
"Sparse, irregular sampling is becoming a necessity for reconstructing large and high-dimensional signals. However, the analysis of this type of data remains a challenge. One issue is the robust selection of neighborhoods − a crucial part of analytic tools such as topological decomposition, clustering and gradient estimation. When extracting the topology of sparsely sampled data, common neighborhood strategies such as k-nearest neighbors may lead to inaccurate results, either due to missing neighborhood connections, which introduce false extrema, or due to spurious connections, which conceal true extrema. Other neighborhoods, such as the Delaunay triangulation, are costly to compute and store even in relatively low dimensions. In this paper, we address these issues. We present two new types of neighborhood graphs: a variation on and a generalization of empty region graphs, which considerably improve the robustness of neighborhood-based analysis tools, such as topological decomposition. Our findings suggest that these neighborhood graphs lead to more accurate topological representations of low- and high- dimensional data sets at relatively low cost, both in terms of storage and computation time. We describe the implications of our work in the analysis and visualization of scalar functions, and provide general strategies for computing and applying our neighborhood graphs towards robust data analysis.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064948/","LOCKED","6064948","Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, USA","","Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282925900","1","Carlos Correa","37282925900","Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, USA","Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37269320000","2","Peter Lindstrom","37269320000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.245","714","1861","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064948/","Neighborhood graphs","topology","sparsely sampled data.","","","","","","","Topology","Robustness","Data mining","Noise measurement","","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064948","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","22","1852","Towards Robust Topology of Sparsely Sampled Data","17"

We demonstrate applications of our technique with data from Enzo, an AMR cosmological structure formation simulation code. We show ray-cast visualizations that include contributions from particle data (dark matter and stars, also output by Enzo) and gridded hydrodynamic data.

"Flood disasters are the most common natural risk and tremendous efforts are spent to improve their simulation and management. However, simulation-based investigation of actions that can be taken in case of flood emergencies is rarely done. This is in part due to the lack of a comprehensive framework which integrates and facilitates these efforts. In this paper, we tackle several problems which are related to steering a flood simulation. One issue is related to uncertainty. We need to account for uncertain knowledge about the environment, such as levee-breach locations. Furthermore, the steering process has to reveal how these uncertainties in the boundary conditions affect the confidence in the simulation outcome. Another important problem is that the simulation setup is often hidden in a black-box. We expose system internals and show that simulation steering can be comprehensible at the same time. This is important because the domain expert needs to be able to modify the simulation setup in order to include local knowledge and experience. In the proposed solution, users steer parameter studies through the World Lines interface to account for input uncertainties. The transport of steering information to the underlying data-flow components is handled by a novel meta-flow. The meta-flow is an extension to a standard data-flow network, comprising additional nodes and ropes to abstract parameter control. The meta-flow has a visual representation to inform the user about which control operations happen. Finally, we present the idea to use the data-flow diagram itself for visualizing steering information and simulation results. We discuss a case-study in collaboration with a domain expert who proposes different actions to protect a virtual city from imminent flooding. The key to choosing the best response strategy is the ability to compare different regions of the parameter space while retaining an understanding of what is happening inside the data-flow system.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064950/","LOCKED","6064950","VRVis Vienna, Austria","","VRVis Vienna, Austria","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38111592300","1","Jurgen Waser","38111592300","VRVis Vienna, Austria","VRVis Vienna, Austria","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38580356000","2","Hrvoje Ribicic","38580356000","ETH Zürich, Switzerland","ETH Zürich, Switzerland","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38099765400","3","Raphael Fuchs","38099765400","VRVis Vienna, Austria","VRVis Vienna, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37408064900","4","Christian Hirsch","37408064900","ETH Zürich, Switzerland","ETH Zürich, Switzerland","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38102461400","5","Benjamin Schindler","38102461400","TU Vienna, Austria","TU Vienna, Austria","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38229402400","6","Gunther Bloschl","38229402400","TU Vienna, Austria","TU Vienna, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284271200","7","Eduard Groller","37284271200","","","","","","","","","","","","","33","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.225","783","1881","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064950/","Emergency/Disaster Management","Visual Knowledge Discovery","Visualization System and Toolkit Design","Data-Flow","Meta-Flow","Parameter Study","Uncertainty","Visualization of Control.","","Data visualization","Navigation","Disaster management","Control systems","Emergency services","Data visualization","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064950","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","24","1872","Nodes on Ropes: A Comprehensive Data and Control Flow for Steering Ensemble Simulations","17"
"In Toponomics, the function protein pattern in cells or tissue (the toponome) is imaged and analyzed for applications in toxicology, new drug development and patient-drug-interaction. The most advanced imaging technique is robot-driven multi-parameter fluorescence microscopy. This technique is capable of co-mapping hundreds of proteins and their distribution and assembly in protein clusters across a cell or tissue sample by running cycles of fluorescence tagging with monoclonal antibodies or other affinity reagents, imaging, and bleaching in situ. The imaging results in complex multi-parameter data composed of one slice or a 3D volume per affinity reagent. Biologists are particularly interested in the localization of co-occurring proteins, the frequency of co-occurrence and the distribution of co-occurring proteins across the cell. We present an interactive visual analysis approach for the evaluation of multi-parameter fluorescence microscopy data in toponomics. Multiple, linked views facilitate the definition of features by brushing multiple dimensions. The feature specification result is linked to all views establishing a focus+context visualization in 3D. In a new attribute view, we integrate techniques from graph visualization. Each node in the graph represents an affinity reagent while each edge represents two co-occurring affinity reagent bindings. The graph visualization is enhanced by glyphs which encode specific properties of the binding. The graph view is equipped with brushing facilities. By brushing in the spatial and attribute domain, the biologist achieves a better understanding of the function protein patterns of a cell. Furthermore, an interactive table view is integrated which summarizes unique fluorescence patterns. We discuss our approach with respect to a cell probe containing lymphocytes and a prostate tissue section.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064951/","LOCKED","6064951","University of Magdeburg, Germany","","University of Magdeburg, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37424645600","1","Steffen Oeltze","37424645600","SimVis GmbH, Vienna, Austria","SimVis GmbH, Vienna, Austria","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017008700","2","Wolfgang Freiler","38017008700","University of Magdeburg, Germany","University of Magdeburg, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017009300","3","Reyk Hillert","38017009300","SimVis GmbH, Vienna, Austria","SimVis GmbH, Vienna, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546620400","4","Helmut Doleisch","37546620400","University of Magdeburg, Germany","University of Magdeburg, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37424645300","5","Bernhard Preim","37424645300","University of Magdeburg, Germany","University of Magdeburg, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37410289200","6","Walter Schubert","37410289200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.217","730","1891","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064951/","Visual Analytics","Fluorescence Microscopy","Toponomics","Protein Interaction","Graph Visualization.","","","","","Microscopy","Fluorescence","Graphics","Three dimensional displays","Biological information theory","Image color analysis","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064951","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","25","1882","Interactive, Graph-based Visual Analysis of High-dimensional, Multi-parameter Fluorescence Microscopy Data in Toponomics","17"
"In this paper we address the difficult problem of parameter-finding in image segmentation. We replace a tedious manual process that is often based on guess-work and luck by a principled approach that systematically explores the parameter space. Our core idea is the following two-stage technique: We start with a sparse sampling of the parameter space and apply a statistical model to estimate the response of the segmentation algorithm. The statistical model incorporates a model of uncertainty of the estimation which we use in conjunction with the actual estimate in (visually) guiding the user towards areas that need refinement by placing additional sample points. In the second stage the user navigates through the parameter space in order to determine areas where the response value (goodness of segmentation) is high. In our exploration we rely on existing ground-truth images in order to evaluate the ""goodness"" of an image segmentation technique. We evaluate its usefulness by demonstrating this technique on two image segmentation algorithms: a three parameter model to detect microtubules in electron tomograms and an eight parameter model to identify functional regions in dynamic Positron Emission Tomography scans.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064952/","LOCKED","6064952","GrUVi (Graphics, Usability, and Visualization Laboratory), Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada","","GrUVi (Graphics, Usability, and Visualization Laboratory), Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38340104300","1","Thomas Torsney-Weir","38340104300","GrUVi (Graphics, Usability, and Visualization Laboratory), Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada","GrUVi (Graphics, Usability, and Visualization Laboratory), Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38349512700","2","Ahmed Saad","38349512700","GrUVi (Graphics, Usability, and Visualization Laboratory), Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada","GrUVi (Graphics, Usability, and Visualization Laboratory), Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275858700","3","Torsten Moller","37275858700","Zuse Institute Berlin, Berlin, Germany","Zuse Institute Berlin, Berlin, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282272000","4","Hans-Christian Hege","37282272000","Zuse Institute Berlin, Berlin, Germany","Zuse Institute Berlin, Berlin, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38002090200","5","Britta Weber","38002090200","Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics (MPI-CBG) in Dresden, Germany","Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics (MPI-CBG) in Dresden, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38293263700","6","Jean-Marc Verbavatz","38293263700","GrUVi (Graphics, Usability, and Visualization Laboratory), Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada","GrUVi (Graphics, Usability, and Visualization Laboratory), Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37418878100","7","Steven Bergner","37418878100","","","","","","","","","","","","","83","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.248","1529","1901","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064952/","Parameter exploration","Image segmentation","Gaussian Process Model.","","","","","","","Image segmentation","Computational modeling","Gaussian processes","Uncertainty","Response surface methodology","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064952","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","26","1892","Tuner: Principled Parameter Finding for Image Segmentation Algorithms Using Visual Response Surface Exploration","17"
"Large observations and simulations in scientific research give rise to high-dimensional data sets that present many challenges and opportunities in data analysis and visualization. Researchers in application domains such as engineering, computational biology, climate study, imaging and motion capture are faced with the problem of how to discover compact representations of highdimensional data while preserving their intrinsic structure. In many applications, the original data is projected onto low-dimensional space via dimensionality reduction techniques prior to modeling. One problem with this approach is that the projection step in the process can fail to preserve structure in the data that is only apparent in high dimensions. Conversely, such techniques may create structural illusions in the projection, implying structure not present in the original high-dimensional data. Our solution is to utilize topological techniques to recover important structures in high-dimensional data that contains non-trivial topology. Specifically, we are interested in high-dimensional branching structures. We construct local circle-valued coordinate functions to represent such features. Subsequently, we perform dimensionality reduction on the data while ensuring such structures are visually preserved. Additionally, we study the effects of global circular structures on visualizations. Our results reveal never-before-seen structures on real-world data sets from a variety of applications.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064953/","LOCKED","6064953","SCI Institute, University of Utah, USA","","SCI Institute, University of Utah, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38025846900","1","Bei Wang","38025846900","SCI Institute, University of Utah, USA","SCI Institute, University of Utah, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38288824300","2","Brian Summa","38288824300","SCI Institute, University of Utah, USA","SCI Institute, University of Utah, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284312600","3","Valerio Pascucci","37284312600","Stanford University, USA","Stanford University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38362453600","4","Mikael Vejdemo-Johansson","38362453600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","31","2","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.177","756","1911","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064953/","Dimensionality reduction","circular coordinates","visualization","topological analysis.","","","","","","Data visualization","Topology","Algorithm design and analysis","Feature extraction","Approximation methods","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064953","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","27","1902","Branching and Circular Features in High Dimensional Data","17"
"Continuous Parallel Coordinates (CPC) are a contemporary visualization technique in order to combine several scalar fields, given over a common domain. They facilitate a continuous view for parallel coordinates by considering a smooth scalar field instead of a finite number of straight lines. We show that there are feature curves in CPC which appear to be the dominant structures of a CPC. We present methods to extract and classify them and demonstrate their usefulness to enhance the visualization of CPCs. In particular, we show that these feature curves are related to discontinuities in Continuous Scatterplots (CSP). We show this by exploiting a curve-curve duality between parallel and Cartesian coordinates, which is a generalization of the well-known point-line duality. Furthermore, we illustrate the theoretical considerations. Concluding, we discuss relations and aspects of the CPC's/CSP's features concerning the data analysis.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064954/","LOCKED","6064954","Department of Simulation and Graphics, University of Magdeburg, Germany","","Department of Simulation and Graphics, University of Magdeburg, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601992200","1","Dirk J.

"In this paper, we present a user study in which we have investigated the influence of seven state-of-the-art volumetric illumination models on the spatial perception of volume rendered images. Within the study, we have compared gradient-based shading with half angle slicing, directional occlusion shading, multidirectional occlusion shading, shadow volume propagation, spherical harmonic lighting as well as dynamic ambient occlusion. To evaluate these models, users had to solve three tasks relying on correct depth as well as size perception. Our motivation for these three tasks was to find relations between the used illumination model, user accuracy and the elapsed time. In an additional task, users had to subjectively judge the output of the tested models. After first reviewing the models and their features, we will introduce the individual tasks and discuss their results. We discovered statistically significant differences in the testing performance of the techniques. Based on these findings, we have analyzed the models and extracted those features which are possibly relevant for the improved spatial comprehension in a relational task. We believe that a combination of these distinctive features could pave the way for a novel illumination model, which would be optimized based on our findings.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064955/","LOCKED","6064955","Visualization and Computer Graphics Research Group, University of Münster, Germany","","Visualization and Computer Graphics Research Group, University of Münster, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017009000","1","Florian Lindemann","38017009000","Scientific Visualization Group, Linköping University, Sweden","Scientific Visualization Group, Linköping University, Sweden","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295281400","2","Timo Ropinski","37295281400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","55","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.161","904","1931","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064955/","Volumetric illumination","volume rendering","spatial comprehension.","","","","","","","Light sources","Rendering (computer graphics)","Harmonic analysis","Computational modeling","Image color analysis","Solid modeling","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064955","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","29","1922","About the Influence of Illumination Models on Image Comprehension in Direct Volume Rendering","17"
"In this paper we present a framework to define transfer functions from a target distribution provided by the user. A target distribution can reflect the data importance, or highly relevant data value interval, or spatial segmentation. Our approach is based on a communication channel between a set of viewpoints and a set of bins of a volume data set, and it supports 1D as well as 2D transfer functions including the gradient information. The transfer functions are obtained by minimizing the informational divergence or Kullback-Leibler distance between the visibility distribution captured by the viewpoints and a target distribution selected by the user. The use of the derivative of the informational divergence allows for a fast optimization process. Different target distributions for 1D and 2D transfer functions are analyzed together with importance-driven and view-based techniques.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064956/","LOCKED","6064956","University of Girona, Spain","","University of Girona, Spain","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017257300","1","Marc Ruiz","38017257300","University of Girona, Spain","University of Girona, Spain","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272788000","2","Anton Bardera","37272788000","University of Girona, Spain","University of Girona, Spain","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37563064000","3","Imma Boada","37563064000","University of Bergen, Norway","University of Bergen, Norway","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282726800","4","Ivan Viola","37282726800","University of Girona, Spain","University of Girona, Spain","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37426689600","5","Miquel Feixas","37426689600","University of Girona, Spain","University of Girona, Spain","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396572900","6","Mateu Sbert","37396572900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","39","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.173","812","1941","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064956/","Transfer function","Information theory","Informational divergence","Kullback-Leibler distance.","","","","","","Transfer functions","Information analysis","Mutual information","Data visualization","Probability distribution","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064956","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","30","1932","Automatic Transfer Functions Based on Informational Divergence","17"
"Overlaid reference elements need to be sufficiently visible to effectively relate to the underlying information, but not so obtrusive that they clutter the presentation. We seek to create guidelines for presenting such structures through experimental studies to define boundary conditions for visual intrusiveness. We base our work on the practice of designers, who use transparency to integrate overlaid grids with their underlying imagery. Previous work discovered a useful range of alpha values for black or white grids overlayed on scatterplot images rendered in shades of gray over gray backgrounds of different lightness values. This work compares black grids to blue and red ones on different image types of scatterplots and maps. We expected that the coloured grids over grayscale images would be more visually salient than black ones, resulting in lower alpha values. Instead, we found that there was no significant difference between the boundaries set for red and black grids, but that the boundaries for blue grids were set consistently higher (more opaque). As in our previous study, alpha values are affected by image density rather than image type, and are consistently lower than many default settings. These results have implications for the design of subtle reference structures.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064957/","LOCKED","6064957","Simon Fraser University, Canada","","Simon Fraser University, Canada","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37353447100","1","Lyn Bartram","37353447100","Simon Fraser University, Canada","Simon Fraser University, Canada","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38027547900","2","Billy Cheung","38027547900","Simon Fraser University, Canada","Simon Fraser University, Canada","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37376130500","3","Maureen Stone","37376130500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","9","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.242","907","1948","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064957/","Information visualization","automated presentation","applied perception","visual design","computational aesthetics.","","","","","Image color analysis","Complexity theory","Educational institutions","Data visualization","","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064957","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","31","1942","The Effect of Colour and Transparency on the Perception of Overlaid Grids","17"
"A new type of glyph is introduced to visualize unsteady flow with static images, allowing easier analysis of time-dependent phenomena compared to animated visualization. Adopting the visual metaphor of radar displays, this glyph represents flow directions by angles and time by radius in spherical coordinates. Dense seeding of flow radar glyphs on the flow domain naturally lends itself to multi-scale visualization: zoomed-out views show aggregated overviews, zooming-in enables detailed analysis of spatial and temporal characteristics. Uncertainty visualization is supported by extending the glyph to display possible ranges of flow directions. The paper focuses on 2D flow, but includes a discussion of 3D flow as well. Examples from CFD and the field of stochastic hydrogeology show that it is easy to discriminate regions of different spatiotemporal flow behavior and regions of different uncertainty variations in space and time. The examples also demonstrate that parameter studies can be analyzed because the glyph design facilitates comparative visualization. Finally, different variants of interactive GPU-accelerated implementations are discussed.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064958/","LOCKED","6064958","Visualization Research Center (VISUS), University of Stuttgart, Germany","","Visualization Research Center (VISUS), University of Stuttgart, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546168600","1","Marcel Hlawatsch","37546168600","Institut of Hydraulic Engineering (LH2), University of Stuttgart, Germany","Institut of Hydraulic Engineering (LH2), University of Stuttgart, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017000700","2","Philipp Leube","38017000700","Institut of Hydraulic Engineering (LH2), University of Stuttgart, Germany","Institut of Hydraulic Engineering (LH2), University of Stuttgart, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38018564200","3","Wolfgang Nowak","38018564200","Visualization Research Center (VISUS), University of Stuttgart, Germany","Visualization Research Center (VISUS), University of Stuttgart, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268045000","4","Daniel Weiskopf","37268045000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","47","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.203","1450","1958","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064958/","Visualization","glyph","uncertainty","unsteady flow.","","","","","","Data visualization","Three dimensional displays","Vectors","Radar imaging","Uncertainty","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064958","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","32","1949","Flow Radar Glyphs—Static Visualization of Unsteady Flow with Uncertainty","17"
"The unguided visual exploration of volumetric data can be both a challenging and a time-consuming undertaking. Identifying a set of favorable vantage points at which to start exploratory expeditions can greatly reduce this effort and can also ensure that no important structures are being missed. Recent research efforts have focused on entropy-based viewpoint selection criteria that depend on scalar values describing the structures of interest. In contrast, we propose a viewpoint suggestion pipeline that is based on feature-clustering in high-dimensional space. We use gradient/normal variation as a metric to identify interesting local events and then cluster these via k-means to detect important salient composite features. Next, we compute the maximum possible exposure of these composite feature for different viewpoints and calculate a 2D entropy map parameterized in longitude and latitude to point out promising view orientations. Superimposed onto an interactive track-ball interface, users can then directly use this entropy map to quickly navigate to potentially interesting viewpoints where visibility-based transfer functions can be employed to generate volume renderings that minimize occlusions. To give full exploration freedom to the user, the entropy map is updated on the fly whenever a view has been selected, pointing to new and promising but so far unseen view directions. Alternatively, our system can also use a set-cover optimization algorithm to provide a minimal set of views needed to observe all features. The views so generated could then be saved into a list for further inspection or into a gallery for a summary presentation.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064959/","LOCKED","6064959","Visual Analytics and Imaging (VAI) Laboratory, Center for Visual Computing, Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA","","Visual Analytics and Imaging (VAI) Laboratory, Center for Visual Computing, Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37599599100","1","Ziyi Zheng","37599599100","Visual Analytics and Imaging (VAI) Laboratory, Center for Visual Computing, Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA","Visual Analytics and Imaging (VAI) Laboratory, Center for Visual Computing, Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38021380500","2","Nafees Ahmed","38021380500","Visual Analytics and Imaging (VAI) Laboratory, Center for Visual Computing, Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA","Visual Analytics and Imaging (VAI) Laboratory, Center for Visual Computing, Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273119700","3","Klaus Mueller","37273119700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","16","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.218","787","1968","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064959/","Direct volume rendering","k-means","entropy","view suggestion","set-cover problem","ant colony optimization.","","","","Transfer functions","Entropy","Rendering (computer graphics)","Feature extraction","Clustering algorithms","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064959","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","33","1959","iView: A Feature Clustering Framework for Suggesting Informative Views in Volume Visualization","17"
"The combination of volume data acquired by multiple modalities has been recognized as an important but challenging task. Modalities often differ in the structures they can delineate and their joint information can be used to extend the classification space. However, they frequently exhibit differing types of artifacts which makes the process of exploiting the additional information non-trivial. In this paper, we present a framework based on an information-theoretic measure of isosurface similarity between different modalities to overcome these problems. The resulting similarity space provides a concise overview of the differences between the two modalities, and also serves as the basis for an improved selection of features. Multimodal classification is expressed in terms of similarities and dissimilarities between the isosurfaces of individual modalities, instead of data value combinations. We demonstrate that our approach can be used to robustly extract features in applications such as dual energy computed tomography of parts in industrial manufacturing.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064960/","LOCKED","6064960","Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, Vienna University of Technology, Austria","","Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, Vienna University of Technology, Austria","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403983600","1","Martin Haidacher","37403983600","Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, Vienna University of Technology, Austria","Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, Vienna University of Technology, Austria","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37265895700","2","Stefan Bruckner","37265895700","Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, Vienna University of Technology, Austria","Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, Vienna University of Technology, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284271200","3","Eduard Groller","37284271200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","24","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.258","598","1978","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064960/","Multimodal data","volume visualization","surface similarity.","","","","","","","Isosurfaces","Histograms","Computed tomography","Transfer functions","Mutual information","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064960","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","34","1969","Volume Analysis Using Multimodal Surface Similarity","17"
"Asymmetric tensor field visualization can provide important insight into fluid flows and solid deformations. Existing techniques for asymmetric tensor fields focus on the analysis, and simply use evenly-spaced hyperstreamlines on surfaces following eigenvectors and dual-eigenvectors in the tensor field. In this paper, we describe a hybrid visualization technique in which hyperstreamlines and elliptical glyphs are used in real and complex domains, respectively. This enables a more faithful representation of flow behaviors inside complex domains. In addition, we encode tensor magnitude, an important quantity in tensor field analysis, using the density of hyperstreamlines and sizes of glyphs. This allows colors to be used to encode other important tensor quantities. To facilitate quick visual exploration of the data from different viewpoints and at different resolutions, we employ an efficient image-space approach in which hyperstreamlines and glyphs are generated quickly in the image plane. The combination of these techniques leads to an efficient tensor field visualization system for domain scientists. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our visualization technique through applications to complex simulated engine fluid flow and earthquake deformation data. Feedback from domain expert scientists, who are also co-authors, is provided.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064961/","LOCKED","6064961","SCI, University of Utah, USA","","SCI, University of Utah, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087942878","1","Darrel Palke","37087942878","Oregon State University, USA","Oregon State University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37897252000","2","Zhongzang Lin","37897252000","Oregon State University, USA","Oregon State University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37069800000","3","Guoning Chen","37069800000","Oregon State University, USA","Oregon State University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37889942300","4","Harry Yeh","37889942300","Oregon State University, USA","Oregon State University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38024282800","5","Paul Vincent","38024282800","Swansea University, UK","Swansea University, UK","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267247900","6","Robert Laramee","37267247900","Oregon State University, USA","Oregon State University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37398562200","7","Eugene Zhang","37398562200","","","","","","","","","","","","","21","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.170","698","1988","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064961/","Tensor field visualization","asymmetric tensor fields","vector field visualization","fluid dynamics","solid deformation","earthquakeengineering","glyph packing","hyperstreamline placement","view-dependent visualization.","Tensile stress","Visualization","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Data visualization","Manifolds","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064961","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","35","1979","Asymmetric Tensor Field Visualization for Surfaces","17"
"Analyzing either high-frequency shape detail or any other 2D fields (scalar or vector) embedded over a 3D geometry is a complex task, since detaching the detail from the overall shape can be tricky. An alternative approach is to move to the 2D space, resolving shape reasoning to easier image processing techniques. In this paper we propose a novel framework for the analysis of 2D information distributed over 3D geometry, based on a locally smooth parametrization technique that allows us to treat local 3D data in terms of image content. The proposed approach has been implemented as a sketch-based system that allows to design with a few gestures a set of (possibly overlapping) parameterizations of rectangular portions of the surface. We demonstrate that, due to the locality of the parametrization, the distortion is under an acceptable threshold, while discontinuities can be avoided since the parametrized geometry is always homeomorphic to a disk. We show the effectiveness of the proposed technique to solve specific Cultural Heritage (CH) tasks: the analysis of chisel marks over the surface of a unfinished sculpture and the local comparison of multiple photographs mapped over the surface of an artwork.

"When visualizing tubular 3D structures, external representations are often used for guidance and display, and such views in 2D can often contain occlusions. Virtual dissection methods have been proposed where the entire 3D structure can be mapped to the 2D plane, though these will lose context by straightening curved sections. We present a new method of creating maps of 3D tubular structures that yield a succinct view while preserving the overall geometric structure. Given a dominant view plane for the structure, its curve skeleton is first projected to a 2D skeleton. This 2D skeleton is adjusted to account for distortions in length, modified to remove intersections, and optimized to preserve the shape of the original 3D skeleton. Based on this shaped 2D skeleton, a boundary for the map of the object is obtained based on a slicing path through the structure and the radius around the skeleton. The sliced structure is conformally mapped to a rectangle and then deformed via harmonic mapping to match the boundary placement. This flattened map preserves the general geometric context of a 3D object in a 2D display, and rendering of this flattened map can be accomplished using volumetric ray casting. We have evaluated our method on real datasets of human colon models.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064963/","LOCKED","6064963","Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, USA","","Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37605959300","1","Joseph Marino","37605959300","Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, USA","Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37393948000","2","Wei Zeng","37393948000","Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, USA","Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37276603700","3","Xianfeng Gu","37276603700","Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, USA","Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268052800","4","Arie Kaufman","37268052800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.182","472","2004","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064963/","Geometry-based technique","volume rendering","biomedical visualization","medical visualization","conformal mapping.","","","","","Three dimensional displays","Volume measurement","Shape analysis","Geometry","Navigation","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064963","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","37","1997","Context Preserving Maps of Tubular Structures","17"
"Parameterization of complex surfaces constitutes a major means of visualizing highly convoluted geometric structures as well as other properties associated with the surface. It also enables users with the ability to navigate, orient, and focus on regions of interest within a global view and overcome the occlusions to inner concavities. In this paper, we propose a novel area-preserving surface parameterization method which is rigorous in theory, moderate in computation, yet easily extendable to surfaces of non-disc and closed-boundary topologies. Starting from the distortion induced by an initial parameterization, an area restoring diffeomorphic flow is constructed as a Lie advection of differential 2-forms along the manifold, which yields equality of the area elements between the domain and the original surface at its final state. Existence and uniqueness of result are assured through an analytical derivation. Based upon a triangulated surface representation, we also present an efficient algorithm in line with discrete differential modeling. As an exemplar application, the utilization of this method for the effective visualization of brain cortical imaging modalities is presented. Compared with conformal methods, our method can reveal more subtle surface patterns in a quantitative manner. It, therefore, provides a competitive alternative to the existing parameterization techniques for better surface-based analysis in various scenarios.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064964/","LOCKED","6064964","Wayne State University, USA","","Wayne State University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37301933100","1","Guangyu Zou","37301933100","Wayne State University, USA","Wayne State University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38006143400","2","Jiaxi Hu","38006143400","State University of New York, Stony Brook, USA","State University of New York, Stony Brook, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37276603700","3","Xianfeng Gu","37276603700","Wayne State University, USA","Wayne State University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37285799200","4","Jing Hua","37285799200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","39","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.171","505","2014","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064964/","Area-preserving surface parameterization","differential forms","Lie advection","surface visualization.","","","","","","Vectors","Surface treatment","Geometry","Boundary conditions","Manifolds","Measurement","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064964","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","38","2005","Authalic Parameterization of General Surfaces Using Lie Advection","17"
"A fundamental challenge for time-varying volume data analysis and visualization is the lack of capability to observe and track data change or evolution in an occlusion-free, controllable, and adaptive fashion. In this paper, we propose to organize a timevarying data set into a hierarchy of states. By deriving transition probabilities among states, we construct a global map that captures the essential transition relationships in the time-varying data. We introduce the TransGraph, a graph-based representation to visualize hierarchical state transition relationships. The TransGraph not only provides a visual mapping that abstracts data evolution over time in different levels of detail, but also serves as a navigation tool that guides data exploration and tracking. The user interacts with the TransGraph and makes connection to the volumetric data through brushing and linking. A set of intuitive queries is provided to enable knowledge extraction from time-varying data. We test our approach with time-varying data sets of different characteristics and the results show that the TransGraph can effectively augment our ability in understanding time-varying data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064965/","LOCKED","6064965","Department of Computer Science, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA","","Department of Computer Science, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38021343000","1","Yi Gu","38021343000","Department of Computer Science, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA","Department of Computer Science, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37405886900","2","Chaoli Wang","37405886900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","37","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.246","981","2024","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064965/","Time-varying data visualization","hierarchical representation","states","transition relationship","user interface.","","","","","Data visualization","Hierarchical systems","Histograms","Data mining","User interfaces","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064965","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","39","2015","TransGraph: Hierarchical Exploration of Transition Relationships in Time-Varying Volumetric Data","17"
"Visual analysis is widely used to study the behavior of molecules. Of particular interest are the analysis of molecular interactions and the investigation of binding sites. For large molecules, however, it is difficult to detect possible binding sites and paths leading to these sites by pure visual inspection. In this paper, we present new methods for the computation and visualization of potential molecular paths. Using a novel filtering method, we extract the significant paths from the Voronoi diagram of spheres. For the interactive visualization of molecules and their paths, we present several methods using deferred shading and other state-of-theart techniques. To allow for a fast overview of reachable regions of the molecule, we illuminate the molecular surface using a large number of light sources placed on the extracted paths. We also provide a method to compute the extension surface of selected paths and visualize it using the skin surface. Furthermore, we use the extension surface to clip the molecule to allow easy visual tracking of even deeply buried paths. The methods are applied to several proteins to demonstrate their usefulness.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064966/","LOCKED","6064966","Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany","","Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017029700","1","Norbert Lindow","38017029700","Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany","Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38182750200","2","Daniel Baum","38182750200","Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany","Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282272000","3","Hans-Christian Hege","37282272000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","46","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.259","882","2034","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064966/","Molecular visualization","data filtering","geometry-based techniques","view-dependent visualization.","","","","","","Topology","Logic gates","Atomic measurements","Cavity resonators","Molecular computing","Filtering theory","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064966","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","40","2025","Voronoi-Based Extraction and Visualization of Molecular Paths","17"
"Study of symmetric or repeating patterns in scalar fields is important in scientific data analysis because it gives deep insights into the properties of the underlying phenomenon. Though geometric symmetry has been well studied within areas like shape processing, identifying symmetry in scalar fields has remained largely unexplored due to the high computational cost of the associated algorithms. We propose a computationally efficient algorithm for detecting symmetric patterns in a scalar field distribution by analysing the topology of level sets of the scalar field. Our algorithm computes the contour tree of a given scalar field and identifies subtrees that are similar. We define a robust similarity measure for comparing subtrees of the contour tree and use it to group similar subtrees together. Regions of the domain corresponding to subtrees that belong to a common group are extracted and reported to be symmetric. Identifying symmetry in scalar fields finds applications in visualization, data exploration, and feature detection. We describe two applications in detail: symmetry-aware transfer function design and symmetry-aware isosurface extraction.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064967/","LOCKED","6064967","Department of Computer Science and Automation, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India","","Department of Computer Science and Automation, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38258503300","1","Dilip Mathew Thomas","38258503300","Department of Computer Science and Automation, and Supercomputer Education Research Centre, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India","Department of Computer Science and Automation, and Supercomputer Education Research Centre, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37278509300","2","Vijay Natarajan","37278509300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","25","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.236","630","2044","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064967/","Scalar field symmetry","contour tree","similarity measure","persistence","isosurface extraction","transfer function design.","","","","Shape analysis","Vectors","Level set","Topology","Robustness","Transfer functions","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064967","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","41","2035","Symmetry in Scalar Field Topology","17"
"This paper introduces a novel importance measure for critical points in 2D scalar fields. This measure is based on a combination of the deep structure of the scale space with the well-known concept of homological persistence. We enhance the noise robust persistence measure by implicitly taking the hill-, ridge- and outlier-like spatial extent of maxima and minima into account. This allows for the distinction between different types of extrema based on their persistence at multiple scales. Our importance measure can be computed efficiently in an out-of-core setting. To demonstrate the practical relevance of our method we apply it to a synthetic and a real-world data set and evaluate its performance and scalability.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064968/","LOCKED","6064968","Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany","","Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590998600","1","Jan Reininghaus","37590998600","Technische Universitat Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Rheinland-Pfalz, DE","Technische Universitat Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Rheinland-Pfalz, DE","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233218800","2","Natallia Kotava","38233218800","Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany","Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087448816","3","David Guenther","37087448816","Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany","Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38028453100","4","Jens Kasten","38028453100","University of Kaiserslautern, Germany","University of Kaiserslautern, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282578800","5","Hans Hagen","37282578800","Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany","Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282721800","6","Ingrid Hotz","37282721800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","22","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.159","502","2052","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064968/","Scale space","persistence","discrete Morse theory.","","","","","","","Feature extraction","Noise measurement","Noise robustness","Laplace equations","Scalability","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064968","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","42","2045","A Scale Space Based Persistence Measure for Critical Points in 2D Scalar Fields","17"
"Multi-valued data sets are increasingly common, with the number of dimensions growing. A number of multi-variate visualization techniques have been presented to display such data. However, evaluating the utility of such techniques for general data sets remains difficult. Thus most techniques are studied on only one data set. Another criticism that could be levied against previous evaluations of multi-variate visualizations is that the task doesn't require the presence of multiple variables. At the same time, the taxonomy of tasks that users may perform visually is extensive. We designed a task, trend localization, that required comparison of multiple data values in a multi-variate visualization. We then conducted a user study with this task, evaluating five multivariate visualization techniques from the literature (Brush Strokes, Data-Driven Spots, Oriented Slivers, Color Blending, Dimensional Stacking) and juxtaposed grayscale maps. We report the results and discuss the implications for both the techniques and the task.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064969/","LOCKED","6064969","Naval Research Laboratory, USA","","Naval Research Laboratory, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300434300","1","Mark A.

"Flows through tubular structures are common in many fields, including blood flow in medicine and tubular fluid flows in engineering. The analysis of such flows is often done with a strong reference to the main flow direction along the tubular boundary. In this paper we present an approach for straightening the visualization of tubular flow. By aligning the main reference direction of the flow, i.e., the center line of the bounding tubular structure, with one axis of the screen, we are able to natively juxtapose (1.) different visualizations of the same flow, either utilizing different flow visualization techniques, or by varying parameters of a chosen approach such as the choice of seeding locations for integration-based flow visualization, (2.) the different time steps of a time-dependent flow, (3.) different projections around the center line , and (4.) quantitative flow visualizations in immediate spatial relation to the more qualitative classical flow visualization. We describe how to utilize this approach for an informative interactive visual analysis. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by visualizing two datasets from two different fields: an arterial blood flow measurement and a tubular gas flow simulation from the automotive industry.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064970/","LOCKED","6064970","Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Norway","","Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Norway","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37889160600","1","Paolo Angelelli","37889160600","Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Norway","Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Norway","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274158800","2","Helwig Hauser","37274158800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","28","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.235","578","2070","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064970/","Flow Visualization","Data Reformation","Comparative Visualization.","","","","","","","Data visualization","Vectors","Data models","Three dimensional displays","Flow visualization","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064970","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","44","2063","Straightening Tubular Flow for Side-by-Side Visualization","17"
"We present the visual analysis of a biologically inspired CFD simulation of the deformable flapping wings of a dragonfly as it takes off and begins to maneuver, using vortex detection and integration-based flow lines. The additional seed placement and perceptual challenges introduced by having multiple dynamically deforming objects in the highly unsteady 3D flow domain are addressed. A brief overview of the high speed photogrammetry setup used to capture the dragonfly takeoff, parametric surfaces used for wing reconstruction, CFD solver and underlying flapping flight theory is presented to clarify the importance of several unsteady flight mechanisms, such as the leading edge vortex, that are captured visually. A novel interactive seed placement method is used to simplify the generation of seed curves that stay in the vicinity of relevant flow phenomena as they move with the flapping wings. This method allows a user to define and evaluate the quality of a seed's trajectory over time while working with a single time step. The seed curves are then used to place particles, streamlines and generalized streak lines. The novel concept of flowing seeds is also introduced in order to add visual context about the instantaneous vector fields surrounding smoothly animate streak lines. Tests show this method to be particularly effective at visually capturing vortices that move quickly or that exist for a very brief period of time. In addition, an automatic camera animation method is used to address occlusion issues caused when animating the immersed wing boundaries alongside many geometric flow lines. Each visualization method is presented at multiple time steps during the up-stroke and down-stroke to highlight the formation, attachment and shedding of the leading edge vortices in pairs of wings. Also, the visualizations show evidence of wake capture at stroke reversal which suggests the existence of previously unknown unsteady lift generation mechanisms that are unique to quad wing insects.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064971/","LOCKED","6064971","College of Engineering and Computer Science, Wright State University, USA","","College of Engineering and Computer Science, Wright State University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37665393300","1","Christopher Koehler","37665393300","College of Engineering and Computer Science, Wright State University, USA","College of Engineering and Computer Science, Wright State University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282584400","2","Thomas Wischgoll","37282584400","College of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Wright State University, USA","College of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Wright State University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37836660700","3","Haibo Dong","37836660700","College of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Wright State University, USA","College of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Wright State University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017003700","4","Zachary Gaston","38017003700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","28","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.260","1185","2079","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064971/","Flow visualization","flowing seed points","streak lines","streamlines","insect flight","vortex visualization","unsteady flow.","","","Three dimensional displays","Trajectory","Data visualization","Flow visualization","Insects","Feature extraction","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064971","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","45","2071","Vortex Visualization in Ultra Low Reynolds Number Insect Flight","17"
"Acceleration is a fundamental quantity of flow fields that captures Galilean invariant properties of particle motion. Considering the magnitude of this field, minima represent characteristic structures of the flow that can be classified as saddle- or vortex-like. We made the interesting observation that vortex-like minima are enclosed by particularly pronounced ridges. This makes it possible to define boundaries of vortex regions in a parameter-free way. Utilizing scalar field topology, a robust algorithm can be designed to extract such boundaries. They can be arbitrarily shaped. An efficient tracking algorithm allows us to display the temporal evolution of vortices. Various vortex models are used to evaluate the method. We apply our method to two-dimensional model systems from computational fluid dynamics and compare the results to those arising from existing definitions.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064972/","LOCKED","6064972","Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany","","Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38028453100","1","Jens Kasten","38028453100","Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany","Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590998600","2","Jan Reininghaus","37590998600","Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany","Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282721800","3","Ingrid Hotz","37282721800","Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany","Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282272000","4","Hans-Christian Hege","37282272000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","46","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.249","526","2087","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064972/","Vortex regions","time-dependent flow fields","feature extraction.","","","","","","","Flow visualization","Topology","Feature extraction","Shape analysis","Navier-Stokes equations","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064972","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","46","2080","Two-Dimensional Time-Dependent Vortex Regions Based on the Acceleration Magnitude","17"
"We consider the problem of extracting discrete two-dimensional vortices from a turbulent flow. In our approach we use a reference model describing the expected physics and geometry of an idealized vortex. The model allows us to derive a novel correlation between the size of the vortex and its strength, measured as the square of its strain minus the square of its vorticity. For vortex detection in real models we use the strength parameter to locate potential vortex cores, then measure the similarity of our ideal analytical vortex and the real vortex core for different strength thresholds. This approach provides a metric for how well a vortex core is modeled by an ideal vortex. Moreover, this provides insight into the problem of choosing the thresholds that identify a vortex. By selecting a target coefficient of determination (i.e., statistical confidence), we determine on a per-vortex basis what threshold of the strength parameter would be required to extract that vortex at the chosen confidence. We validate our approach on real data from a global ocean simulation and derive from it a map of expected vortex strengths over the global ocean.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064973/","LOCKED","6064973","Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA","","Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA","Institute for Data Analysis and Visualization, University of California, Davis, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37534471500","1","Sean Williams","37534471500","Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA","Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37529329300","2","Mark Petersen","37529329300","Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, USA","Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564112000","3","Peer-Timo Bremer","37564112000","Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA","Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38028545000","4","Matthew Hecht","38028545000","Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA","Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284312600","5","Valerio Pascucci","37284312600","Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA","Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282713700","6","James Ahrens","37282713700","Universität Leipzig, Germany","Universität Leipzig, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403333700","7","Mario Hlawitschka","37403333700","Institute for Data Analysis and Visualization, University of California, Davis, USA","Institute for Data Analysis and Visualization, University of California, Davis, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282068700","8","Bernd Hamann","37282068700","","","","","","","57","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.162","662","2095","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064973/","Vortex extraction","feature extraction","statistical data analysis.","","","","","","","Feature extraction","Information analysis","Data visualization","Data mining","Data models","Atmospheric modeling","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064973","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","47","2088","Adaptive Extraction and Quantification of Geophysical Vortices","17"
"Research in the field of complex fluids such as polymer solutions, particulate suspensions and foams studies how the flow of fluids with different material parameters changes as a result of various constraints. Surface Evolver, the standard solver software used to generate foam simulations, provides large, complex, time-dependent data sets with hundreds or thousands of individual bubbles and thousands of time steps. However this software has limited visualization capabilities, and no foam specific visualization software exists. We describe the foam research application area where, we believe, visualization has an important role to play. We present a novel application that provides various techniques for visualization, exploration and analysis of time-dependent 2D foam simulation data. We show new features in foam simulation data and new insights into foam behavior discovered using our application.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064974/","LOCKED","6064974","Swansea University, UK","","Swansea University, UK","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088135314","1","Dan Lipsa","37088135314","Swansea University, UK","Swansea University, UK","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267247900","2","Robert Laramee","37267247900","Aberystwyth University, UK","Aberystwyth University, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088135909","3","Simon Cox","37088135909","Aberystwyth University, UK","Aberystwyth University, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088137308","4","Tudur Davies","37088137308","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.204","587","2105","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064974/","Surface Evolver","bubble-scale simulation","time-dependent visualizations.","","","","","","","Data visualization","Data models","Computational modeling","Image color analysis","Visualization","Analytical models","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064974","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","48","2096","FoamVis: Visualization of 2D Foam Simulation Data","17"
"In this paper, we propose a volume visualization system that accepts direct manipulation through a sketch-based What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) approach. Similar to the operations in painting applications for 2D images, in our system, a full set of tools have been developed to enable direct volume rendering manipulation of color, transparency, contrast, brightness, and other optical properties by brushing a few strokes on top of the rendered volume image. To be able to smartly identify the targeted features of the volume, our system matches the sparse sketching input with the clustered features both in image space and volume space. To achieve interactivity, both special algorithms to accelerate the input identification and feature matching have been developed and implemented in our system. Without resorting to tuning transfer function parameters, our proposed system accepts sparse stroke inputs and provides users with intuitive, flexible and effective interaction during volume data exploration and visualization.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064975/","LOCKED","6064975","Center for Computational Science and Engineering, Peking University, China","","Center for Computational Science and Engineering, Peking University, China","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085681553","1","Hanqi Guo","37085681553","Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University, China","Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University, China","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38027433600","2","Ningyu Mao","38027433600","Peking University, Beijing, Beijing, CN","Peking University, Beijing, Beijing, CN","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403856700","3","Xiaoru Yuan","37403856700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","59","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.261","1160","2114","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064975/","Volume rendering","Sketching input","Human-computer interaction","Transfer functions","Feature space.","","","","","Transfer functions","Rendering (computer graphics)","Image color analysis","Data visualization","Real time systems","Semantics","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064975","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","49","2106","WYSIWYG (What You See is What You Get) Volume Visualization","17"
"This paper presents a novel framework for visualizing volumetric data specified on complex polyhedral grids, without the need to perform any kind of a priori tetrahedralization. These grids are composed of polyhedra that often are non-convex and have an arbitrary number of faces, where the faces can be non-planar with an arbitrary number of vertices. The importance of such grids in state-of-the-art simulation packages is increasing rapidly. We propose a very compact, face-based data structure for representing such meshes for visualization, called two-sided face sequence lists (TSFSL), as well as an algorithm for direct GPU-based ray-casting using this representation. The TSFSL data structure is able to represent the entire mesh topology in a 1D TSFSL data array of face records, which facilitates the use of efficient 1D texture accesses for visualization. In order to scale to large data sizes, we employ a mesh decomposition into bricks that can be handled independently, where each brick is then composed of its own TSFSL array. This bricking enables memory savings and performance improvements for large meshes. We illustrate the feasibility of our approach with real-world application results, by visualizing highly complex polyhedral data from commercial state-of-the-art simulation packages.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064976/","LOCKED","6064976","Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria","","Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546620600","1","Philipp Muigg","37546620600","King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia","King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37394809600","2","Markus Hadwiger","37394809600","SimVis GmbH, Vienna, Austria","SimVis GmbH, Vienna, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546620400","3","Helmut Doleisch","37546620400","Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria","Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284271200","4","Eduard Groller","37284271200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","20","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.216","627","2124","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064976/","Volume rendering","unstructured grids","polyhedral grids","GPU-based visualization.","","","","","","Geometry","Rendering (computer graphics)","Data visualization","Graphics processing unit","","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064976","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","50","2115","Interactive Volume Visualization of General Polyhedral Grids","17"
"In recent years, many volumetric illumination models have been proposed, which have the potential to simulate advanced lighting effects and thus support improved image comprehension. Although volume ray-casting is widely accepted as the volume rendering technique which achieves the highest image quality, so far no volumetric illumination algorithm has been designed to be directly incorporated into the ray-casting process. In this paper we propose image plane sweep volume illumination (IPSVI), which allows the integration of advanced illumination effects into a GPU-based volume ray-caster by exploiting the plane sweep paradigm. Thus, we are able to reduce the problem complexity and achieve interactive frame rates, while supporting scattering as well as shadowing. Since all illumination computations are performed directly within a single rendering pass, IPSVI does not require any preprocessing nor does it need to store intermediate results within an illumination volume. It therefore has a significantly lower memory footprint than other techniques. This makes IPSVI directly applicable to large data sets. Furthermore, the integration into a GPU-based ray-caster allows for high image quality as well as improved rendering performance by exploiting early ray termination. This paper discusses the theory behind IPSVI, describes its implementation, demonstrates its visual results and provides performance measurements.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064977/","LOCKED","6064977","Scientific Visualization Group, Linköping University, Sweden","","Scientific Visualization Group, Linköping University, Sweden","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37063678500","1","Erik Sunden","37063678500","Scientific Visualization Group, Linköping University, Sweden","Scientific Visualization Group, Linköping University, Sweden","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284192000","2","Anders Ynnerman","37284192000","Scientific Visualization Group, Linköping University, Sweden","Scientific Visualization Group, Linköping University, Sweden","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295281400","3","Timo Ropinski","37295281400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","22","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.211","759","2134","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064977/","Interactive volume rendering","GPU-based ray-casting","Advanced illumination.","","","","","","","Rendering (computer graphics)","Light sources","Mathematical model","Equations","Synchronization","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064977","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","51","2125","Image Plane Sweep Volume Illumination","17"
"Large scale and structurally complex volume datasets from high-resolution 3D imaging devices or computational simulations pose a number of technical challenges for interactive visual analysis. In this paper, we present the first integration of a multiscale volume representation based on tensor approximation within a GPU-accelerated out-of-core multiresolution rendering framework. Specific contributions include (a) a hierarchical brick-tensor decomposition approach for pre-processing large volume data, (b) a GPU accelerated tensor reconstruction implementation exploiting CUDA capabilities, and (c) an effective tensor-specific quantization strategy for reducing data transfer bandwidth and out-of-core memory footprint. Our multiscale representation allows for the extraction, analysis and display of structural features at variable spatial scales, while adaptive level-of-detail rendering methods make it possible to interactively explore large datasets within a constrained memory footprint. The quality and performance of our prototype system is evaluated on large structurally complex datasets, including gigabyte-sized micro-tomographic volumes.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064978/","LOCKED","6064978","University of Zurich, Switzerland","","University of Zurich, Switzerland","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017011900","1","Susanne K.

"Color vision deficiency (CVD) affects a high percentage of the population worldwide. When seeing a volume visualization result, persons with CVD may be incapable of discriminating the classification information expressed in the image if the color transfer function or the color blending used in the direct volume rendering is not appropriate. Conventional methods used to address this problem adopt advanced image recoloring techniques to enhance the rendering results frame-by-frame; unfortunately, problematic perceptual results may still be generated. This paper proposes an alternative solution that complements the image recoloring scheme by reconfiguring the components of the direct volume rendering (DVR) pipeline. Our approach optimizes the mapped colors of a transfer function to simulate CVD-friendly effect that is generated by applying the image recoloring to the results with the initial transfer function. The optimization process has a low computational complexity, and only needs to be performed once for a given transfer function. To achieve detail-preserving and perceptually natural semi-transparent effects, we introduce a new color composition mode that works in the color space of dichromats. Experimental results and a pilot study demonstrates that our approach can yield dichromats-friendly and consistent volume visualization in real-time.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064979/","LOCKED","6064979","State Key Laboratory of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, China","","State Key Laboratory of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, China","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38024756400","1","Weifeng Chen","38024756400","State Key Laboratory of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, China","State Key Laboratory of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, China","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37291847800","2","Wei Chen","37291847800","State Key Laboratory of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, China","State Key Laboratory of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271755400","3","Hujun Bao","37271755400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.164","762","2152","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064979/","Dichromacy","direct volume rendering","volume classification","image recoloring.","","","","","","Image color analysis","Transfer functions","Data visualization","Volume measurement","Linear systems","Rendering (computer graphics)","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064979","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","53","2144","An Efficient Direct Volume Rendering Approach for Dichromats","17"
"Better understanding of hemodynamics conceivably leads to improved diagnosis and prognosis of cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, an elaborate analysis of the blood-flow in heart and thoracic arteries is essential. Contemporary MRI techniques enable acquisition of quantitative time-resolved flow information, resulting in 4D velocity fields that capture the blood-flow behavior. Visual exploration of these fields provides comprehensive insight into the unsteady blood-flow behavior, and precedes a quantitative analysis of additional blood-flow parameters. The complete inspection requires accurate segmentation of anatomical structures, encompassing a time-consuming and hard-to-automate process, especially for malformed morphologies. We present a way to avoid the laborious segmentation process in case of qualitative inspection, by introducing an interactive virtual probe. This probe is positioned semi-automatically within the blood-flow field, and serves as a navigational object for visual exploration. The difficult task of determining position and orientation along the view-direction is automated by a fitting approach, aligning the probe with the orientations of the velocity field. The aligned probe provides an interactive seeding basis for various flow visualization approaches. We demonstrate illustration-inspired particles, integral lines and integral surfaces, conveying distinct characteristics of the unsteady blood-flow. Lastly, we present the results of an evaluation with domain experts, valuing the practical use of our probe and flow visualization techniques.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064980/","LOCKED","6064980","Department of Biomedical Engineering, group of Biomedical Image Analysis, Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands","","Department of Biomedical Engineering, group of Biomedical Image Analysis, Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37390973400","1","Roy van Pelt","37390973400","Department of iXR Innovation, Philips Healthcare, Netherlands","Department of iXR Innovation, Philips Healthcare, Netherlands","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086889017","2","Javier Olivan Bescos","37086889017","Department of Biomedical Engineering, group of Biomedical Image Analysis, Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands","Department of Biomedical Engineering, group of Biomedical Image Analysis, Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37374875300","3","Marcel Breeuwer","37374875300","Division of Imaging Sciences, Department of Vascular Surgery, NIHR Comprehensive Biomedical Research Centre of Guys and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust, Kings College London, UK","Division of Imaging Sciences, Department of Vascular Surgery, NIHR Comprehensive Biomedical Research Centre of Guys and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust, Kings College London, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37603313200","4","Rachel E.

"In modern clinical practice, planning access paths to volumetric target structures remains one of the most important and most complex tasks, and a physician's insufficient experience in this can lead to severe complications or even the death of the patient. In this paper, we present a method for safety evaluation and the visualization of access paths to assist physicians during preoperative planning. As a metaphor for our method, we employ a well-known, and thus intuitively perceivable, natural phenomenon that is usually called crepuscular rays. Using this metaphor, we propose several ways to compute the safety of paths from the region of interest to all tumor voxels and show how this information can be visualized in real-time using a multi-volume rendering system. Furthermore, we show how to estimate the extent of connected safe areas to improve common medical 2D multi-planar reconstruction (MPR) views. We evaluate our method by means of expert interviews, an online survey, and a retrospective evaluation of 19 real abdominal radio-frequency ablation (RFA) interventions, with expert decisions serving as a gold standard. The evaluation results show clear evidence that our method can be successfully applied in clinical practice without introducing substantial overhead work for the acting personnel. Finally, we show that our method is not limited to medical applications and that it can also be useful in other fields.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064981/","LOCKED","6064981","Graz University of Technology, Austria","","Graz University of Technology, Austria","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590719600","1","Rostislav Khlebnikov","37590719600","Graz University of Technology, Austria","Graz University of Technology, Austria","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38493138300","2","Bernhard Kainz","38493138300","Graz University of Technology, Austria","Graz University of Technology, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590720800","3","Judith Muehl","37590720800","Graz University of Technology, Austria","Graz University of Technology, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37297103800","4","Dieter Schmalstieg","37297103800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","18","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.184","369","2172","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064981/","Accessibility","ray casting","medical visualization.","","","","","","","Biomedical image processing","Tumors","Rendering (computer graphics)","Three dimensional displays","","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064981","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","55","2163","Crepuscular Rays for Tumor Accessibility Planning","17"
"An instant and quantitative assessment of spatial distances between two objects plays an important role in interactive applications such as virtual model assembly, medical operation planning, or computational steering. While some research has been done on the development of distance-based measures between two objects, only very few attempts have been reported to visualize such measures in interactive scenarios. In this paper we present two different approaches for this purpose, and we investigate the effectiveness of these approaches for intuitive 3D implant positioning in a medical operation planning system. The first approach uses cylindrical glyphs to depict distances, which smoothly adapt their shape and color to changing distances when the objects are moved. This approach computes distances directly on the polygonal object representations by means of ray/triangle mesh intersection. The second approach introduces a set of slices as additional geometric structures, and uses color coding on surfaces to indicate distances. This approach obtains distances from a precomputed distance field of each object. The major findings of the performed user study indicate that a visualization that can facilitate an instant and quantitative analysis of distances between two objects in interactive 3D scenarios is demanding, yet can be achieved by including additional monocular cues into the visualization.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064982/","LOCKED","6064982","Computer Graphics and Visualization Group, Technische Universität München, Germany","","Computer Graphics and Visualization Group, Technische Universität München, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38013954900","1","Christian Dick","38013954900","Klinik für Orthopädie u.

"Blood flow and derived data are essential to investigate the initiation and progression of cerebral aneurysms as well as their risk of rupture. An effective visual exploration of several hemodynamic attributes like the wall shear stress (WSS) and the inflow jet is necessary to understand the hemodynamics. Moreover, the correlation between focus-and-context attributes is of particular interest. An expressive visualization of these attributes and anatomic information requires appropriate visualization techniques to minimize visual clutter and occlusions. We present the FLOWLENS as a focus-and-context approach that addresses these requirements. We group relevant hemodynamic attributes to pairs of focus-and-context attributes and assign them to different anatomic scopes. For each scope, we propose several FLOWLENS visualization templates to provide a flexible visual filtering of the involved hemodynamic pairs. A template consists of the visualization of the focus attribute and the additional depiction of the context attribute inside the lens. Furthermore, the FLOWLENS supports local probing and the exploration of attribute changes over time.

"Multi-material components, which contain metal parts surrounded by plastic materials, are highly interesting for inspection using industrial 3D X-ray computed tomography (3DXCT). Examples of this application scenario are connectors or housings with metal inlays in the electronic or automotive industry. A major problem of this type of components is the presence of metal, which causes streaking artifacts and distorts the surrounding media in the reconstructed volume. Streaking artifacts and dark-band artifacts around metal components significantly influence the material characterization (especially for the plastic components). In specific cases these artifacts even prevent a further analysis. Due to the nature and the different characteristics of artifacts, the development of an efficient artifact-reduction technique in reconstruction-space is rather complicated. In this paper we present a projection-space pipeline for metal-artifacts reduction. The proposed technique first segments the metal in the spatial domain of the reconstructed volume in order to separate it from the other materials. Then metal parts are forward-projected on the set of projections in a way that metal-projection regions are treated as voids. Subsequently the voids, which are left by the removed metal, are interpolated in the 2D projections. Finally, the metal is inserted back into the reconstructed 3D volume during the fusion stage. We present a visual analysis tool, allowing for interactive parameter estimation of the metal segmentation. The results of the proposed artifact-reduction technique are demonstrated on a test part as well as on real world components. For these specimens we achieve a significant reduction of metal artifacts, allowing an enhanced material characterization.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064984/","LOCKED","6064984","Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, Vienna University of Technology, Austria","","Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, Vienna University of Technology, Austria","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590979900","1","Artem Amirkhanov","37590979900","Upper Austrian University of Applied Sciences, Austria","Upper Austrian University of Applied Sciences, Austria","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37400391300","2","Christoph Heinzl","37400391300","Upper Austrian University of Applied Sciences, Austria","Upper Austrian University of Applied Sciences, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593834800","3","Michael Reiter","37593834800","Upper Austrian University of Applied Sciences, Austria","Upper Austrian University of Applied Sciences, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37947609000","4","Johann Kastner","37947609000","Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, Vienna University of Technology, Austria","Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, Vienna University of Technology, Austria","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284271200","5","Eduard Groller","37284271200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","18","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.228","1044","2202","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064984/","Metal-artifact reduction","multi-material components","visual analysis","3D X-ray computed tomography.","","","","","","Three dimensional displays","Image reconstruction","Computed tomography","Interpolation","Information analysis","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064984","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","58","2193","Projection-Based Metal-Artifact Reduction for Industrial 3D X-ray Computed Tomography","17"
"In this paper, we present a systematization of techniques that use quality metrics to help in the visual exploration of meaningful patterns in high-dimensional data. In a number of recent papers, different quality metrics are proposed to automate the demanding search through large spaces of alternative visualizations (e.g., alternative projections or ordering), allowing the user to concentrate on the most promising visualizations suggested by the quality metrics. Over the last decade, this approach has witnessed a remarkable development but few reflections exist on how these methods are related to each other and how the approach can be developed further. For this purpose, we provide an overview of approaches that use quality metrics in high-dimensional data visualization and propose a systematization based on a thorough literature review. We carefully analyze the papers and derive a set of factors for discriminating the quality metrics, visualization techniques, and the process itself. The process is described through a reworked version of the well-known information visualization pipeline. We demonstrate the usefulness of our model by applying it to several existing approaches that use quality metrics, and we provide reflections on implications of our model for future research.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064985/","LOCKED","6064985","University of Konstanz, Germany","","University of Konstanz, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38267713800","1","Enrico Bertini","38267713800","University of Konstanz, Germany","University of Konstanz, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590724000","2","Andrada Tatu","37590724000","University of Konstanz, Germany","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","3","Daniel Keim","37283138700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","172","4","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.229","4666","2212","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064985/","Quality Metrics","High-Dimensional Data Visualization.","","","","","","","","Data visualization","Measurements","","","","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064985","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","59","2203","Quality Metrics in High-Dimensional Data Visualization: An Overview and Systematization","17"
"Many well-cited theories for visualization design state that a visual representation should be optimized for quick and immediate interpretation by a user. Distracting elements like decorative ""chartjunk"" or extraneous information are avoided so as not to slow comprehension. Yet several recent studies in visualization research provide evidence that non-efficient visual elements may benefit comprehension and recall on the part of users. Similarly, findings from studies related to learning from visual displays in various subfields of psychology suggest that introducing cognitive difficulties to visualization interaction can improve a user's understanding of important information. In this paper, we synthesize empirical results from cross-disciplinary research on visual information representations, providing a counterpoint to efficiency-based design theory with guidelines that describe how visual difficulties can be introduced to benefit comprehension and recall. We identify conditions under which the application of visual difficulties is appropriate based on underlying factors in visualization interaction like active processing and engagement. We characterize effective graph design as a trade-off between efficiency and learning difficulties in order to provide Information Visualization (InfoVis) researchers and practitioners with a framework for organizing explorations of graphs for which comprehension and recall are crucial. We identify implications of this view for the design and evaluation of information visualizations.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064986/","LOCKED","6064986","University of Michigan, USA","","University of Michigan, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38016234500","1","Jessica Hullman","38016234500","University of Michigan, USA","University of Michigan, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37331417100","2","Eytan Adar","37331417100","University of Michigan, USA","University of Michigan, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38018860000","3","Priti Shah","38018860000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","78","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.175","2127","2222","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064986/","Desirable difficulites","cognitive efficiency","active processing","engagement","individual differences.","","","","","Psychology","Data visualization","Time factors","Cognition","","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064986","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","60","2213","Benefitting InfoVis with Visual Difficulties","17"

"Narrative visualizations combine conventions of communicative and exploratory information visualization to convey an intended story. We demonstrate visualization rhetoric as an analytical framework for understanding how design techniques that prioritize particular interpretations in visualizations that ""tell a story"" can significantly affect end-user interpretation. We draw a parallel between narrative visualization interpretation and evidence from framing studies in political messaging, decision-making, and literary studies. Devices for understanding the rhetorical nature of narrative information visualizations are presented, informed by the rigorous application of concepts from critical theory, semiotics, journalism, and political theory. We draw attention to how design tactics represent additions or omissions of information at various levels−the data, visual representation, textual annotations, and interactivity−and how visualizations denote and connote phenomena with reference to unstated viewing conventions and codes. Classes of rhetorical techniques identified via a systematic analysis of recent narrative visualizations are presented, and characterized according to their rhetorical contribution to the visualization. We describe how designers and researchers can benefit from the potentially positive aspects of visualization rhetoric in designing engaging, layered narrative visualizations and how our framework can shed light on how a visualization design prioritizes specific interpretations. We identify areas where future inquiry into visualization rhetoric can improve understanding of visualization interpretation.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064988/","LOCKED","6064988","University of Michigan, USA","","University of Michigan, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38016234500","1","Jessica Hullman","38016234500","Rutgers University, USA","Rutgers University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591165700","2","Nick Diakopoulos","37591165700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","221","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.255","7626","2240","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064988/","Rhetoric","narrative visualization","framing effects","semiotics","denotation","connotation.","","","","Data visualization","Rhetoric","Semiotics","","","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064988","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","62","2231","Visualization Rhetoric: Framing Effects in Narrative Visualization","17"
"Current information visualization techniques assume unrestricted access to data. However, privacy protection is a key issue for a lot of real-world data analyses. Corporate data, medical records, etc. are rich in analytical value but cannot be shared without first going through a transformation step where explicit identifiers are removed and the data is sanitized. Researchers in the field of data mining have proposed different techniques over the years for privacy-preserving data publishing and subsequent mining techniques on such sanitized data. A well-known drawback in these methods is that for even a small guarantee of privacy, the utility of the datasets is greatly reduced. In this paper, we propose an adaptive technique for privacy preser vation in parallel coordinates. Based on knowledge about the sensitivity of the data, we compute a clustered representation on the fly, which allows the user to explore the data without breaching privacy. Through the use of screen-space privacy metrics, the technique adapts to the user's screen parameters and interaction. We demonstrate our method in a case study and discuss potential attack scenarios.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064989/","LOCKED","6064989","UNC-Charlotte, USA","","UNC-Charlotte, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593202500","1","Aritra Dasgupta","37593202500","UNC-Charlotte, USA","UNC-Charlotte, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282563400","2","Robert Kosara","37282563400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","32","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.163","1209","2248","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064989/","Parallel coordinates","privacy","clustering.","","","","","","","Data visualization","Privacy","Data privacy","Clustering algorithms","","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064989","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","63","2241","Adaptive Privacy-Preserving Visualization Using Parallel Coordinates","17"
"Evaluating, comparing, and interpreting related pieces of information are tasks that are commonly performed during visual data analysis and in many kinds of information-intensive work. Synchronized visual highlighting of related elements is a well-known technique used to assist this task. An alternative approach, which is more invasive but also more expressive is visual linking in which line connections are rendered between related elements. In this work, we present context-preserving visual links as a new method for generating visual links. The method specifically aims to fulfill the following two goals: first, visual links should minimize the occlusion of important information; second, links should visually stand out from surrounding information by minimizing visual interference. We employ an image-based analysis of visual saliency to determine the important regions in the original representation. A consequence of the image-based approach is that our technique is application-independent and can be employed in a large number of visual data analysis scenarios in which the underlying content cannot or should not be altered. We conducted a controlled experiment that indicates that users can find linked elements in complex visualizations more quickly and with greater subjective satisfaction than in complex visualizations in which plain highlighting is used. Context-preserving visual links were perceived as visually more attractive than traditional visual links that do not account for the context information.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064990/","LOCKED","6064990","Graz Univeristy of Technology, Austria","","Graz Univeristy of Technology, Austria","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017759700","1","Markus Steinberger","38017759700","Graz Univeristy of Technology, Austria","Graz Univeristy of Technology, Austria","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37844773200","2","Manuela Waldner","37844773200","Graz Univeristy of Technology, Austria","Graz Univeristy of Technology, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403918900","3","Marc Streit","37403918900","Graz Univeristy of Technology, Austria","Graz Univeristy of Technology, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37395933400","4","Alexander Lex","37395933400","Graz Univeristy of Technology, Austria","Graz Univeristy of Technology, Austria","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37297103800","5","Dieter Schmalstieg","37297103800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","71","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.183","1037","2258","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064990/","Visual links","highlighting","connectedness","routing","image-based","saliency.","","","","Data visualization","Image color analysis","Histograms","","","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064990","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","64","2249","Context-Preserving Visual Links","17"
"Computing and visualizing sets of elements and their relationships is one of the most common tasks one performs when analyzing and organizing large amounts of data. Common representations of sets such as convex or concave geometries can become cluttered and difficult to parse when these sets overlap in multiple or complex ways, e.g., when multiple elements belong to multiple sets. In this paper, we present a design study of a novel set visual representation, LineSets, consisting of a curve connecting all of the set's elements. Our approach to design the visualization differs from traditional methodology used by the InfoVis community. We first explored the potential of the visualization concept by running a controlled experiment comparing our design sketches to results from the state-of-the-art technique. Our results demonstrated that LineSets are advantageous for certain tasks when compared to concave shapes. We discuss an implementation of LineSets based on simple heuristics and present a study demonstrating that our generated curves do as well as human-drawn ones. Finally, we present two applications of our technique in the context of search tasks on a map and community analysis tasks in social networks.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064991/","LOCKED","6064991","Microsoft Research and UC Santa Barbara, USA","","Microsoft Research and UC Santa Barbara, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38030020400","1","Basak Alper","38030020400","Microsoft Research Limited, UK","Microsoft Research Limited, UK","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590950700","2","Nathalie Riche","37590950700","Microsoft Research Limited, UK","Microsoft Research Limited, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38030407700","3","Gonzalo Ramos","38030407700","Microsoft Research Limited, UK","Microsoft Research Limited, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37563799500","4","Mary Czerwinski","37563799500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","115","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.186","1702","2267","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064991/","Set visualization","clustering","faceted data visualization","graph visualization.","","","","","","Data visualization","Social network services","Shape analysis","Accuracy","Geometry","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064991","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","65","2259","Design Study of LineSets, a Novel Set Visualization Technique","17"
"Traditional layered graph depictions such as flow charts are in wide use. Yet as graphs grow more complex, these depictions can become difficult to understand. Quilts are matrix-based depictions for layered graphs designed to address this problem. In this research, we first improve Quilts by developing three design alternatives, and then compare the best of these alternatives to better-known node-link and matrix depictions. A primary weakness in Quilts is their depiction of skip links, links that do not simply connect to a succeeding layer. Therefore in our first study, we compare Quilts using color-only, text-only, and mixed (color and text) skip link depictions, finding that path finding with the color-only depiction is significantly slower and less accurate, and that in certain cases, the mixed depiction offers an advantage over the text-only depiction. In our second study, we compare Quilts using the mixed depiction to node-link diagrams and centered matrices. Overall results show that users can find paths through graphs significantly faster with Quilts (46.6 secs) than with node-link (58.3 secs) or matrix (71.2 secs) diagrams. This speed advantage is still greater in large graphs (e.g. in 200 node graphs, 55.4 secs vs. 71.1 secs for node-link and 84.2 secs for matrix depictions).","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064992/","LOCKED","6064992","NC State University, USA","","NC State University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37595934400","1","Juhee Bae","37595934400","North Carolina State University","North Carolina State University","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37356872100","2","Benjamin Watson","37356872100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","13","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.187","795","2275","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064992/","Graph drawing","layered graphs","matrix based depiction","node-link diagram.","","","","","","Time measurement","Atmospheric measurements","Particle measurements","Analysis of variance","Graphics","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064992","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","66","2268","Developing and Evaluating Quilts for the Depiction of Large Layered Graphs","17"
"The aspect ratio of a plot has a dramatic impact on our ability to perceive trends and patterns in the data. Previous approaches for automatically selecting the aspect ratio have been based on adjusting the orientations or angles of the line segments in the plot. In contrast, we recommend a simple, effective method for selecting the aspect ratio: minimize the arc length of the data curve while keeping the area of the plot constant. The approach is parameterization invariant, robust to a wide range of inputs, preserves visual symmetries in the data, and is a compromise between previously proposed techniques. Further, we demonstrate that it can be effectively used to select the aspect ratio of contour plots. We believe arc length should become the default aspect ratio selection method.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064993/","LOCKED","6064993","Stanford University","","Stanford University","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604514900","1","Justin Talbot","37604514900","Stanford University","Stanford University","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37840462500","2","John Gerth","37840462500","Stanford University","Stanford University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349803800","3","Pat Hanrahan","37349803800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","19","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.167","342","2282","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064993/","Aspect ratio selection","Banking to 45 degrees","Orientation resolution.","","","","","","","Time series analysis","Length measurement","Ratio selection","","","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064993","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","67","2276","Arc Length-Based Aspect Ratio Selection","17"

"Large volumes of real-world data often exhibit inhomogeneities: vertically in the form of correlated or independent dimensions and horizontally in the form of clustered or scattered data items. In essence, these inhomogeneities form the patterns in the data that researchers are trying to find and understand. Sophisticated statistical methods are available to reveal these patterns, however, the visualization of their outcomes is mostly still performed in a one-view-fits-all manner, In contrast, our novel visualization approach, VisBricks, acknowledges the inhomogeneity of the data and the need for different visualizations that suit the individual characteristics of the different data subsets. The overall visualization of the entire data set is patched together from smaller visualizations, there is one VisBrick for each cluster in each group of interdependent dimensions. Whereas the total impression of all VisBricks together gives a comprehensive high-level overview of the different groups of data, each VisBrick independently shows the details of the group of data it represents, State-of-the-art brushing and visual linking between all VisBricks furthermore allows the comparison of the groupings and the distribution of data items among them. In this paper, we introduce the VisBricks visualization concept, discuss its design rationale and implementation, and demonstrate its usefulness by applying it to a use case from the field of biomedicine.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064995/","LOCKED","6064995","Graz University of Technology, Austria","","Graz University of Technology, Austria","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37395933400","1","Alexander Lex","37395933400","Graz University of Technology, Austria","Graz University of Technology, Austria","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37408482600","2","Hans-Jorg Schulz","37408482600","Graz University of Technology, Austria","Graz University of Technology, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403918900","3","Marc Streit","37403918900","Graz University of Technology, Austria","Graz University of Technology, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591066400","4","Christian Partl","37591066400","Graz University of Technology, Austria","Graz University of Technology, Austria","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37297103800","5","Dieter Schmalstieg","37297103800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","45","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.250","1093","2300","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064995/","Inhomogeneous data","multiple coordinated views","multiform visualization.","","","","","","","Nonhomogeneous media","Data visualization","Semantics","","","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064995","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","69","2291","VisBricks: Multiform Visualization of Large, Inhomogeneous Data","17"
"Data-Driven Documents (D3) is a novel representation-transparent approach to visualization for the web. Rather than hide the underlying scenegraph within a toolkit-specific abstraction, D3 enables direct inspection and manipulation of a native representation: the standard document object model (DOM). With D3, designers selectively bind input data to arbitrary document elements, applying dynamic transforms to both generate and modify content. We show how representational transparency improves expressiveness and better integrates with developer tools than prior approaches, while offering comparable notational efficiency and retaining powerful declarative components. Immediate evaluation of operators further simplifies debugging and allows iterative development. Additionally, we demonstrate how D3 transforms naturally enable animation and interaction with dramatic performance improvements over intermediate representations.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064996/","LOCKED","6064996","Computer Science Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA","","Computer Science Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591067400","1","Michael Bostock","37591067400","Computer Science Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA","Computer Science Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38016292400","2","Vadim Ogievetsky","38016292400","Computer Science Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA","Computer Science Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550791300","3","Jeffrey Heer","37550791300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1838","17","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.185","9919","2309","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064996/","Information visualization","user interfaces","toolkits","2D graphics.","","","","","","Data visualization","Cascading style sheets","Image color analysis","Debugging","Information analysis","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064996","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","70","2301","D³ Data-Driven Documents","17"
"Multivariate data visualization is a classic topic, for which many solutions have been proposed, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. In standard solutions the structure of the visualization is fixed, we explore how to give the user more freedom to define visualizations. Our new approach is based on the usage of Flexible Linked Axes: The user is enabled to define a visualization by drawing and linking axes on a canvas. Each axis has an associated attribute and range, which can be adapted. Links between pairs of axes are used to show data in either scatter plot- or Parallel Coordinates Plot-style. Flexible Linked Axes enable users to define a wide variety of different visualizations. These include standard methods, such as scatter plot matrices, radar charts, and PCPs [11]; less well known approaches, such as Hyperboxes [1], TimeWheels [17], and many-to-many relational parallel coordinate displays [14]; and also custom visualizations, consisting of combinations of scatter plots and PCPs. Furthermore, our method allows users to define composite visualizations that automatically support brushing and linking. We have discussed our approach with ten prospective users, who found the concept easy to understand and highly promising.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064997/","LOCKED","6064997","Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands","","Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38016239600","1","Jarry H.T.

"Generation of synthetic datasets is a common practice in many research areas. Such data is often generated to meet specific needs or certain conditions that may not be easily found in the original, real data. The nature of the data varies according to the application area and includes text, graphs, social or weather data, among many others. The common process to create such synthetic datasets is to implement small scripts or programs, restricted to small problems or to a specific application. In this paper we propose a framework designed to generate high dimensional datasets. Users can interactively create and navigate through multi dimensional datasets using a suitable graphical user-interface. The data creation is driven by statistical distributions based on a few user-defined parameters. First, a grounding dataset is created according to given inputs, and then structures and trends are included in selected dimensions and orthogonal projection planes. Furthermore, our framework supports the creation of complex non-orthogonal trends and classified datasets. It can successfully be used to create synthetic datasets simulating important trends as multidimensional clusters, correlations and outliers.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064998/","LOCKED","6064998","Computer Graphics Laboratory, TU Braunschweig, Germany","","Computer Graphics Laboratory, TU Braunschweig, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37603943800","1","Georgia Albuquerque","37603943800","Computer Graphics Laboratory, TU Braunschweig, Germany","Computer Graphics Laboratory, TU Braunschweig, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089041326","2","Thomas Lowe","37089041326","Computer Graphics Laboratory, TU Braunschweig, Germany","Computer Graphics Laboratory, TU Braunschweig, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273816400","3","Marcus Magnor","37273816400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","35","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.237","1855","2324","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064998/","Synthetic data generation","multivariate data","high-dimensional data","interaction.","","","","","","Probability density function","Data processing","Scattering parameters","Correlation","","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064998","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","72","2317","Synthetic Generation of High-Dimensional Datasets","17"
"In this paper we present a new technique and prototype graph visualization system, stereoscopic highlighting, to help answer accessibility and adjacency queries when interacting with a node-link diagram. Our technique utilizes stereoscopic depth to highlight regions of interest in a 2D graph by projecting these parts onto a plane closer to the viewpoint of the user. This technique aims to isolate and magnify specific portions of the graph that need to be explored in detail without resorting to other highlighting techniques like color or motion, which can then be reserved to encode other data attributes. This mechanism of stereoscopic highlighting also enables focus+context views by juxtaposing a detailed image of a region of interest with the overall graph, which is visualized at a further depth with correspondingly less detail. In order to validate our technique, we ran a controlled experiment with 16 subjects comparing static visual highlighting to stereoscopic highlighting on 2D and 3D graph layouts for a range of tasks. Our results show that while for most tasks the difference in performance between stereoscopic highlighting alone and static visual highlighting is not statistically significant, users performed better when both highlighting methods were used concurrently. In more complicated tasks, 3D layout with static visual highlighting outperformed 2D layouts with a single highlighting method. However, it did not outperform the 2D layout utilizing both highlighting techniques simultaneously. Based on these results, we conclude that stereoscopic highlighting is a promising technique that can significantly enhance graph visualizations for certain use cases.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064999/","LOCKED","6064999","Media Arts & Technology Program, University of California, Santa Barbara, USA","","Media Arts & Technology Program, University of California, Santa Barbara, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38030020400","1","Basak Alper","38030020400","Department of Computer Science, University of California, Santa Barbara, USA","Department of Computer Science, University of California, Santa Barbara, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37265602700","2","Tobias Hollerer","37265602700","Media Arts & Technology Program, University of California, Santa Barbara, USA","Media Arts & Technology Program, University of California, Santa Barbara, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38336528300","3","JoAnn Kuchera-Morin","38336528300","Media Arts & Technology Program, University of California, Santa Barbara, USA","Media Arts & Technology Program, University of California, Santa Barbara, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38180697500","4","Angus Forbes","38180697500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","50","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.234","1188","2333","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064999/","Graph visualization","stereo displays","virtual reality.","","","","","","","Two dimensional displays","Graphics","Stereo image processing","Data visualization","Image color analysis","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064999","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","73","2325","Stereoscopic Highlighting: 2D Graph Visualization on Stereo Displays","17"
"The analysis of large dynamic networks poses a challenge in many fields, ranging from large bot-nets to social networks. As dynamic networks exhibit different characteristics, e.g., being of sparse or dense structure, or having a continuous or discrete time line, a variety of visualization techniques have been specifically designed to handle these different aspects of network structure and time. This wide range of existing techniques is well justified, as rarely a single visualization is suitable to cover the entire visual analysis. Instead, visual representations are often switched in the course of the exploration of dynamic graphs as the focus of analysis shifts between the temporal and the structural aspects of the data. To support such a switching in a seamless and intuitive manner, we introduce the concept of in situ visualization- a novel strategy that tightly integrates existing visualization techniques for dynamic networks. It does so by allowing the user to interactively select in a base visualization a region for which a different visualization technique is then applied and embedded in the selection made. This permits to change the way a locally selected group of data items, such as nodes or time points, are shown - right in the place where they are positioned, thus supporting the user's overall mental map. Using this approach, a user can switch seamlessly between different visual representations to adapt a region of a base visualization to the specifics of the data within it or to the current analysis focus. This paper presents and discusses the in situ visualization strategy and its implications for dynamic graph visualization. Furthermore, it illustrates its usefulness by employing it for the visual exploration of dynamic networks from two different fields: model versioning and wireless mesh networks.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065000/","LOCKED","6065000","University of Rostock, Germany","","University of Rostock, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396082800","1","Steffen Hadlak","37396082800","Graz University of Technology, Austria","Graz University of Technology, Austria","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37408482600","2","Hans-Jorg Schulz","37408482600","University of Rostock, Germany","University of Rostock, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283240400","3","Heidrun Schumann","37283240400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","42","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.213","1115","2343","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065000/","Dynamic graph data","multiform visualization","multi-focus+context.","","","","","","","Data visualization","Graphics","","","","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065000","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","74","2334","In Situ Exploration of Large Dynamic Networks","17"
"We present a novel dynamic graph visualization technique based on node-link diagrams. The graphs are drawn side-byside from left to right as a sequence of narrow stripes that are placed perpendicular to the horizontal time line. The hierarchically organized vertices of the graphs are arranged on vertical, parallel lines that bound the stripes; directed edges connect these vertices from left to right. To address massive overplotting of edges in huge graphs, we employ a splatting approach that transforms the edges to a pixel-based scalar field. This field represents the edge densities in a scalable way and is depicted by non-linear color mapping. The visualization method is complemented by interaction techniques that support data exploration by aggregation, filtering, brushing, and selective data zooming. Furthermore, we formalize graph patterns so that they can be interactively highlighted on demand. A case study on software releases explores the evolution of call graphs extracted from the JUnit open source software project. In a second application, we demonstrate the scalability of our approach by applying it to a bibliography dataset containing more than 1.5 million paper titles from 60 years of research history producing a vast amount of relations between title words.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065001/","LOCKED","6065001","VISUS, University of Stuttgart, Germany","","VISUS, University of Stuttgart, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586953400","1","Michael Burch","37586953400","VISUS, University of Stuttgart, Germany","VISUS, University of Stuttgart, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017348600","2","Corinna Vehlow","38017348600","Computer Science Department, University of Trier, Germany","Computer Science Department, University of Trier, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586060300","3","Fabian Beck","37586060300","Computer Science Department, University of Trier, Germany","Computer Science Department, University of Trier, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275546500","4","Stephan Diehl","37275546500","VISUS, University of Stuttgart, Germany","VISUS, University of Stuttgart, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268045000","5","Daniel Weiskopf","37268045000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","124","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.226","2271","2353","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065001/","Dynamic graph visualization","graph splatting","software visualization","software evolution.","","","","","","Graphics","Image edge detection","Data visualization","Encoding","Image color analysis","Software engineering","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065001","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","75","2344","Parallel Edge Splatting for Scalable Dynamic Graph Visualization","17"
"The node-link diagram is an intuitive and venerable way to depict a graph. To reduce clutter and improve the readability of node-link views, Holten & van Wijk's force-directed edge bundling employs a physical simulation to spatially group graph edges. While both useful and aesthetic, this technique has shortcomings: it bundles spatially proximal edges regardless of direction, weight, or graph connectivity. As a result, high-level directional edge patterns are obscured. We present divided edge bundling to tackle these shortcomings. By modifying the forces in the physical simulation, directional lanes appear as an emergent property of edge direction. By considering graph topology, we only bundle edges related by graph structure. Finally, we aggregate edge weights in bundles to enable more accurate visualization of total bundle weights. We compare visualizations created using our technique to standard force-directed edge bundling, matrix diagrams, and clustered graphs; we find that divided edge bundling leads to visualizations that are easier to interpret and reveal both familiar and previously obscured patterns.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065002/","LOCKED","6065002","Computer Science Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA","","Computer Science Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017434000","1","David Selassie","38017434000","Computer Science Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA","Computer Science Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38027228800","2","Brandon Heller","38027228800","Computer Science Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA","Computer Science Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550791300","3","Jeffrey Heer","37550791300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","83","4","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.190","918","2363","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065002/","Graph visualization","aggregation","node-link diagrams","edge bundling","physical simulation.","","","","","Encoding","Graphics","Image edge detection","Data visualization","","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065002","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","76","2354","Divided Edge Bundling for Directional Network Data","17"
"In this paper, we present a novel approach for constructing bundled layouts of general graphs. As layout cues for bundles, we use medial axes, or skeletons, of edges which are similar in terms of position information. We combine edge clustering, distance fields, and 2D skeletonization to construct progressively bundled layouts for general graphs by iteratively attracting edges towards the centerlines of level sets of their distance fields. Apart from clustering, our entire pipeline is image-based with an efficient implementation in graphics hardware. Besides speed and implementation simplicity, our method allows explicit control of the emphasis on structure of the bundled layout, i.e. the creation of strongly branching (organic-like) or smooth bundles. We demonstrate our method on several large real-world graphs.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065003/","LOCKED","6065003","University of Groningen, Netherlands","","University of Groningen, Netherlands","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37672044200","1","Ozan Ersoy","37672044200","DGAC-DTI Research and Development, ENAC, University of Toulouse, France","DGAC-DTI Research and Development, ENAC, University of Toulouse, France","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017336200","2","Christophe Hurter","38017336200","University of Sao Paulo, Brazil","University of Sao Paulo, Brazil","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590969400","3","Fernando Paulovich","37590969400","Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SÃ£o Paulo, BR","Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SÃ£o Paulo, BR","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088027971","4","Gabriel Cantareiro","37088027971","University of Groningen, Netherlands","University of Groningen, Netherlands","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268047100","5","Alex Telea","37268047100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","102","4","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.233","2233","2373","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065003/","Graph layouts","edge bundles","image-based information visualization.","","","","","","","Image edge detection","Shape analysis","Transforms","Smoothing methods","Image processing","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065003","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","77","2364","Skeleton-Based Edge Bundling for Graph Visualization","17"
"Birds are unrivaled windows into biotic processes at all levels and are proven indicators of ecological well-being. Understanding the determinants of species distributions and their dynamics is an important aspect of ecology and is critical for conservation and management. Through crowdsourcing, since 2002, the eBird project has been collecting bird observation records. These observations, together with local-scale environmental covariates such as climate, habitat, and vegetation phenology have been a valuable resource for a global community of educators, land managers, ornithologists, and conservation biologists. By associating environmental inputs with observed patterns of bird occurrence, predictive models have been developed that provide a statistical framework to harness available data for predicting species distributions and making inferences about species-habitat associations. Understanding these models, however, is challenging because they require scientists to quantify and compare multiscale spatialtemporal patterns. A large series of coordinated or sequential plots must be generated, individually programmed, and manually composed for analysis. This hampers the exploration and is a barrier to making the cross-species comparisons that are essential for coordinating conservation and extracting important ecological information. To address these limitations, as part of a collaboration among computer scientists, statisticians, biologists and ornithologists, we have developed BirdVis, an interactive visualization system that supports the analysis of spatio-temporal bird distribution models. BirdVis leverages visualization techniques and uses them in a novel way to better assist users in the exploration of interdependencies among model parameters. Furthermore, the system allows for comparative visualization through coordinated views, providing an intuitive interface to identify relevant correlations and patterns. We justify our design decisions and present case studies that show how BirdVis has helped scientists obtain new evidence for existing hypotheses, as well as formulate new hypotheses in their domain.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065004/","LOCKED","6065004","Polytechnic Institute of New York University, USA","","Polytechnic Institute of New York University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38018628600","1","Nivan Ferreira","38018628600","Polytechnic Institute of New York University, USA","Polytechnic Institute of New York University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37682897900","2","Lauro Lins","37682897900","Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, Cornell University, USA","Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, Cornell University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37410464700","3","Daniel Fink","37410464700","Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, Cornell University, USA","Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, Cornell University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37667188400","4","Steve Kelling","37667188400","Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, Cornell University, USA","Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, Cornell University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088027831","5","Christopher Wood","37088027831","Polytechnic Institute of New York University, USA","Polytechnic Institute of New York University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283149600","6","Juliana Freire","37283149600","Polytechnic Institute of New York University, USA","Polytechnic Institute of New York University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275249200","7","Claudio Silva","37275249200","","","","","","","","","","","","","43","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.176","1375","2383","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065004/","Ornithology","species distribution models","multiscale analysis","spatial data","temporal data.","","","","","Tag clouds","Biological system modeling","Data visualization","Predictive models","Ornithology","Spatial databases","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065004","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","78","2374","BirdVis: Visualizing and Understanding Bird Populations","17"
"The relationship between candidates' position on a ballot paper and vote rank is explored in the case of 5000 candidates for the UK 2010 local government elections in the Greater London area. This design study uses hierarchical spatially arranged graphics to represent two locations that affect candidates at very different scales: the geographical areas for which they seek election and the spatial location of their names on the ballot paper. This approach allows the effect of position bias to be assessed; that is, the degree to which the position of a candidate's name on the ballot paper influences the number of votes received by the candidate, and whether this varies geographically. Results show that position bias was significant enough to influence rank order of candidates, and in the case of many marginal electoral wards, to influence who was elected to government. Position bias was observed most strongly for Liberal Democrat candidates but present for all major political parties. Visual analysis of classification of candidate names by ethnicity suggests that this too had an effect on votes received by candidates, in some cases overcoming alphabetic name bias. The results found contradict some earlier research suggesting that alphabetic name bias was not sufficiently significant to affect electoral outcome and add new evidence for the geographic and ethnicity influences on voting behaviour. The visual approach proposed here can be applied to a wider range of electoral data and the patterns identified and hypotheses derived from them could have significant implications for the design of ballot papers and the conduct of fair elections.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065005/","LOCKED","6065005","GiCentre, School of Informatics, City University London, UK","","GiCentre, School of Informatics, City University London, UK","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399045100","1","Jo Wood","37399045100","GiCentre, School of Informatics, City University London, UK","GiCentre, School of Informatics, City University London, UK","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017330600","2","Donia Badawood","38017330600","GiCentre, School of Informatics, City University London, UK","GiCentre, School of Informatics, City University London, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37605079900","3","Jason Dykes","37605079900","GiCentre, School of Informatics, City University London, UK","GiCentre, School of Informatics, City University London, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590960700","4","Aidan Slingsby","37590960700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","30","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.174","983","2391","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065005/","Voting","election","bias","democracy","governance","treemaps","geovisualization","hierarchy","governance.","Nominations and elections","Data visualization","Local government","Image color analysis","Geospatial analysis","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065005","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","79","2384","BallotMaps: Detecting Name Bias in Alphabetically Ordered Ballot Papers","17"
"In this paper, we introduce overview visualization tools for large-scale multiple genome alignment data. Genome alignment visualization and, more generally, sequence alignment visualization are an important tool for understanding genomic sequence data. As sequencing techniques improve and more data become available, greater demand is being placed on visualization tools to scale to the size of these new datasets. When viewing such large data, we necessarily cannot convey details, rather we specifically design overview tools to help elucidate large-scale patterns. Perceptual science, signal processing theory, and generality provide a framework for the design of such visualizations that can scale well beyond current approaches. We present Sequence Surveyor, a prototype that embodies these ideas for scalable multiple whole-genome alignment overview visualization. Sequence Surveyor visualizes sequences in parallel, displaying data using variable color, position, and aggregation encodings. We demonstrate how perceptual science can inform the design of visualization techniques that remain visually manageable at scale and how signal processing concepts can inform aggregation schemes that highlight global trends, outliers, and overall data distributions as the problem scales. These techniques allow us to visualize alignments with over 100 whole bacterial-sized genomes.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065006/","LOCKED","6065006","University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA","","University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38019392100","1","Danielle Albers","38019392100","University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA","University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37994248400","2","Colin Dewey","37994248400","University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA","University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282585700","3","Michael Gleicher","37282585700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","32","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.232","1011","2401","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065006/","Bioinformatics Visualization","Perception Theory","Scalability Issues","Visual Design.","","","","","","Genomics","Image color analysis","Data visualization","Bioinformatics","Design methodology","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065006","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","80","2392","Sequence Surveyor: Leveraging Overview for Scalable Genomic Alignment Visualization","17"
"Image analysis algorithms are often highly parameterized and much human input is needed to optimize parameter settings. This incurs a time cost of up to several days. We analyze and characterize the conventional parameter optimization process for image analysis and formulate user requirements. With this as input, we propose a change in paradigm by optimizing parameters based on parameter sampling and interactive visual exploration. To save time and reduce memory load, users are only involved in the first step - initialization of sampling - and the last step - visual analysis of output. This helps users to more thoroughly explore the parameter space and produce higher quality results. We describe a custom sampling plug-in we developed for CellProfiler - a popular biomedical image analysis framework. Our main focus is the development of an interactive visualization technique that enables users to analyze the relationships between sampled input parameters and corresponding output. We implemented this in a prototype called Paramorama. It provides users with a visual overview of parameters and their sampled values. User-defined areas of interest are presented in a structured way that includes image-based output and a novel layout algorithm. To find optimal parameter settings, users can tag high- and low-quality results to refine their search. We include two case studies to illustrate the utility of this approach.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065007/","LOCKED","6065007","School of Computing, University of Leeds, UK","","School of Computing, University of Leeds, UK","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38488125800","1","A.

"Understanding how topics evolve in text data is an important and challenging task. Although much work has been devoted to topic analysis, the study of topic evolution has largely been limited to individual topics. In this paper, we introduce TextFlow, a seamless integration of visualization and topic mining techniques, for analyzing various evolution patterns that emerge from multiple topics. We first extend an existing analysis technique to extract three-level features: the topic evolution trend, the critical event, and the keyword correlation. Then a coherent visualization that consists of three new visual components is designed to convey complex relationships between them. Through interaction, the topic mining model and visualization can communicate with each other to help users refine the analysis result and gain insights into the data progressively. Finally, two case studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of TextFlow in helping users understand the major topic evolution patterns in time-varying text data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065008/","LOCKED","6065008","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","Microsoft Research Asia, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37391623900","1","Weiwei Cui","37391623900","Microsoft Research Asia, China","Microsoft Research Asia, China","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406039100","2","Shixia Liu","37406039100","Microsoft Research Asia, China","Microsoft Research Asia, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37597343100","3","Li Tan","37597343100","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38019494400","4","Conglei Shi","38019494400","Microsoft Research Asia, China","Microsoft Research Asia, China","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407140300","5","Yangqiu Song","37407140300","Zhejiang University, China","Zhejiang University, China","Microsoft Research Asia, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088145746","6","Zekai Gao","37088145746","Microsoft Research Asia, China","Microsoft Research Asia, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","7","Huamin Qu","37272637300","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37394723000","8","Xin Tong","37394723000","","","","","","","244","9","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.239","4022","2421","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065008/","Text visualization","Topic evolution","Hierarchical Dirichlet process","Critical event.","","","","","","Text analysis","Data visualization","Tag clouds","Image color analysis","","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065008","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","82","2412","TextFlow: Towards Better Understanding of Evolving Topics in Text","17"
"Visual representations of time-series are useful for tasks such as identifying trends, patterns and anomalies in the data. Many techniques have been devised to make these visual representations more scalable, enabling the simultaneous display of multiple variables, as well as the multi-scale display of time-series of very high resolution or that span long time periods. There has been comparatively little research on how to support the more elaborate tasks associated with the exploratory visual analysis of timeseries, e.g., visualizing derived values, identifying correlations, or discovering anomalies beyond obvious outliers. Such tasks typically require deriving new time-series from the original data, trying different functions and parameters in an iterative manner. We introduce a novel visualization technique called ChronoLenses, aimed at supporting users in such exploratory tasks. ChronoLenses perform on-the-fly transformation of the data points in their focus area, tightly integrating visual analysis with user actions, and enabling the progressive construction of advanced visual analysis pipelines.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065009/","LOCKED","6065009","DGP, University of Toronto, Canada","","DGP, University of Toronto, Canada","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38024987300","1","Jian Zhao","38024987300","OCAD University, Canada","OCAD University, Canada","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37395495900","2","Fanny Chevalier","37395495900","INRIA, France","INRIA, France","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37563810700","3","Emmanuel Pietriga","37563810700","DGP, University of Toronto, Canada","DGP, University of Toronto, Canada","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37394495600","4","Ravin Balakrishnan","37394495600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","54","6","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.195","1767","2431","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065009/","Time-series Data","Exploratory Visualization","Focus+Context","Lens","Interaction Techniques.","","","","","Data visualization","Transforms","Rendering (computer graphics)","Lenses","Time series analysis","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065009","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","83","2422","Exploratory Analysis of Time-Series with ChronoLenses","17"
"We propose incremental logarithmic time-series technique as a way to deal with time-based representations of large and dynamic event data sets in limited space. Modern data visualization problems in the domains of news analysis, network security and financial applications, require visual analysis of incremental data, which poses specific challenges that are normally not solved by static visualizations. The incremental nature of the data implies that visualizations have to necessarily change their content and still provide comprehensible representations. In particular, in this paper we deal with the need to keep an eye on recent events together with providing a context on the past and to make relevant patterns accessible at any scale. Our technique adapts to the incoming data by taking care of the rate at which data items occur and by using a decay function to let the items fade away according to their relevance. Since access to details is also important, we also provide a novel distortion magnifying lens technique which takes into account the distortions introduced by the logarithmic time scale to augment readability in selected areas of interest. We demonstrate the validity of our techniques by applying them on incremental data coming from online news streams in different time frames.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065010/","LOCKED","6065010","University of Konstanz, Germany","","University of Konstanz, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546983800","1","Milos Krstajic","37546983800","University of Konstanz, Germany","University of Konstanz, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38267713800","2","Enrico Bertini","38267713800","University of Konstanz, Germany","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","3","Daniel Keim","37283138700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","117","4","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.179","1890","2439","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065010/","Incremental visualization","event based data","lens distortion.","","","","","","","Time series analysis","Data visualization","Lenses","Estimation","Event detection","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065010","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","84","2432","CloudLines: Compact Display of Event Episodes in Multiple Time-Series","17"
"Node-link diagrams are an effective and popular visualization approach for depicting hierarchical structures and for showing parent-child relationships. In this paper, we present the results of an eye tracking experiment investigating traditional, orthogonal, and radial node-link tree layouts as a piece of empirical basis for choosing between those layouts. Eye tracking was used to identify visual exploration behaviors of participants that were asked to solve a typical hierarchy exploration task by inspecting a static tree diagram: finding the least common ancestor of a given set of marked leaf nodes. To uncover exploration strategies, we examined fixation points, duration, and saccades of participants' gaze trajectories. For the non-radial diagrams, we additionally investigated the effect of diagram orientation by switching the position of the root node to each of the four main orientations. We also recorded and analyzed correctness of answers as well as completion times in addition to the eye movement data. We found out that traditional and orthogonal tree layouts significantly outperform radial tree layouts for the given task. Furthermore, by applying trajectory analysis techniques we uncovered that participants cross-checked their task solution more often in the radial than in the non-radial layouts.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065011/","LOCKED","6065011","VISUS, University of Stuttgart, Germany","","VISUS, University of Stuttgart, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586953400","1","Michael Burch","37586953400","VISUS, University of Stuttgart, Germany","VISUS, University of Stuttgart, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087801279","2","Natalia Konevtsova","37087801279","VISUS, University of Stuttgart, Germany","VISUS, University of Stuttgart, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37665271000","3","Julian Heinrich","37665271000","Universitat Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, DE","Universitat Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, DE","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089466839","4","Markus Hoeferlin","37089466839","VISUS, University of Stuttgart, Germany","VISUS, University of Stuttgart, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268045000","5","Daniel Weiskopf","37268045000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","92","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.193","1741","2448","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065011/","Hierarchy visualization","node-link layout","eye tracking","user study.","","","","","","Data visualization","Tracking","Trajectory","Hierarchical systems","Upper bound","Analysis of variance","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065011","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","85","2440","Evaluation of Traditional, Orthogonal, and Radial Tree Diagrams by an Eye Tracking Study","17"
"Network data often contain important attributes from various dimensions such as social affiliations and areas of expertise in a social network. If such attributes exhibit a tree structure, visualizing a compound graph consisting of tree and network structures becomes complicated. How to visually reveal patterns of a network over a tree has not been fully studied. In this paper, we propose a compound graph model, TreeNet, to support visualization and analysis of a network at multiple levels of aggregation over a tree. We also present a visualization design, TreeNetViz, to offer the multiscale and cross-scale exploration and interaction of a TreeNet graph. TreeNetViz uses a Radial, Space-Filling (RSF) visualization to represent the tree structure, a circle layout with novel optimization to show aggregated networks derived from TreeNet, and an edge bundling technique to reduce visual complexity. Our circular layout algorithm reduces both total edge-crossings and edge length and also considers hierarchical structure constraints and edge weight in a TreeNet graph. These experiments illustrate that the algorithm can reduce visual cluttering in TreeNet graphs. Our case study also shows that TreeNetViz has the potential to support the analysis of a compound graph by revealing multiscale and cross-scale network patterns.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065012/","LOCKED","6065012","College of Information Sciences and Technology, Pennsylvania State University, USA","","College of Information Sciences and Technology, Pennsylvania State University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37075500200","1","Liang Gou","37075500200","College of Information Sciences and Technology, Pennsylvania State University, USA","College of Information Sciences and Technology, Pennsylvania State University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547462","2","Xiaolong Luke Zhang","37086547462","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","18","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.247","978","2458","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065012/","Compound graph","network and tree","TreeNetViz","visualization","multiscale and cross-scale.","","","","","Graphics","Tree data structures","Algorithm design and analysis","Complexity theory","Data visualization","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065012","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","86","2449","TreeNetViz: Revealing Patterns of Networks over Tree Structures","17"
"An alternative form to multidimensional projections for the visual analysis of data represented in multidimensional spaces is the deployment of similarity trees, such as Neighbor Joining trees. They organize data objects on the visual plane emphasizing their levels of similarity with high capability of detecting and separating groups and subgroups of objects. Besides this similarity-based hierarchical data organization, some of their advantages include the ability to decrease point clutter; high precision; and a consistent view of the data set during focusing, offering a very intuitive way to view the general structure of the data set as well as to drill down to groups and subgroups of interest. Disadvantages of similarity trees based on neighbor joining strategies include their computational cost and the presence of virtual nodes that utilize too much of the visual space. This paper presents a highly improved version of the similarity tree technique. The improvements in the technique are given by two procedures. The first is a strategy that replaces virtual nodes by promoting real leaf nodes to their place, saving large portions of space in the display and maintaining the expressiveness and precision of the technique. The second improvement is an implementation that significantly accelerates the algorithm, impacting its use for larger data sets. We also illustrate the applicability of the technique in visual data mining, showing its advantages to support visual classification of data sets, with special attention to the case of image classification. We demonstrate the capabilities of the tree for analysis and iterative manipulation and employ those capabilities to support evolving to a satisfactory data organization and classification.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065013/","LOCKED","6065013","Federal University of Uberlândia and ICMC, Brazil","","Federal University of Uberlândia and ICMC, Brazil","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38287494800","1","Jose Gustavo Paiva","38287494800","Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SÃ£o Paulo, BR","Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SÃ£o Paulo, BR","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087869588","2","Laura Florian","37087869588","IC-University of Campinas, Brazil","IC-University of Campinas, Brazil","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294758000","3","Helio Pedrini","37294758000","IC-University of Campinas, Brazil","IC-University of Campinas, Brazil","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38331135000","4","Guilherme Telles","38331135000","ICMC-University of São Paulo, Brazil","ICMC-University of São Paulo, Brazil","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37371567600","5","Rosane Minghim","37371567600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","33","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.212","1433","2468","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065013/","Similarity Trees","Multidimensional Projections","Image Classification.","","","","","","","Image classification","Data visualization","Phylogeny","Biomedical image processing","Algorithm design and analysis","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065013","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","87","2459","Improved Similarity Trees and their Application to Visual Data Classification","17"
"We present the results of a user study that compares different ways of representing Dual-Scale data charts. Dual-Scale charts incorporate two different data resolutions into one chart in order to emphasize data in regions of interest or to enable the comparison of data from distant regions. While some design guidelines exist for these types of charts, there is currently little empirical evidence on which to base their design. We fill this gap by discussing the design space of Dual-Scale cartesian-coordinate charts and by experimentally comparing the performance of different chart types with respect to elementary graphical perception tasks such as comparing lengths and distances. Our study suggests that cut-out charts which include collocated full context and focus are the best alternative, and that superimposed charts in which focus and context overlap on top of each other should be avoided.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065014/","LOCKED","6065014","INRIA, France","","INRIA, France","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591317800","1","Petra Isenberg","37591317800","École Centrale Paris (SAP BusinessObjects) and LRI, University Paris-Sud & CNRS) & INRIA, France","École Centrale Paris (SAP BusinessObjects) and LRI, University Paris-Sud & CNRS) & INRIA, France","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267832500","2","Anastasia Bezerianos","37267832500","INRIA, France","INRIA, France","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590932700","3","Pierre Dragicevic","37590932700","INRIA, France","INRIA, France","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407972900","4","Jean-Daniel Fekete","37407972900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","23","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.160","678","2478","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065014/","Focus+Context","Quantitative Experiment","Dual-Scale Charts.","","","","","","","Quantization","Data visualization","Image color analysis","Terminology","Shape analysis","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065014","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","88","2469","A Study on Dual-Scale Data Charts","17"
"Heart disease is the number one killer in the United States, and finding indicators of the disease at an early stage is critical for treatment and prevention. In this paper we evaluate visualization techniques that enable the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. A key physical quantity of medical interest is endothelial shear stress (ESS). Low ESS has been associated with sites of lesion formation and rapid progression of disease in the coronary arteries. Having effective visualizations of a patient's ESS data is vital for the quick and thorough non-invasive evaluation by a cardiologist. We present a task taxonomy for hemodynamics based on a formative user study with domain experts. Based on the results of this study we developed HemoVis, an interactive visualization application for heart disease diagnosis that uses a novel 2D tree diagram representation of coronary artery trees. We present the results of a formal quantitative user study with domain experts that evaluates the effect of 2D versus 3D artery representations and of color maps on identifying regions of low ESS. We show statistically significant results demonstrating that our 2D visualizations are more accurate and efficient than 3D representations, and that a perceptually appropriate color map leads to fewer diagnostic mistakes than a rainbow color map.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065015/","LOCKED","6065015","School of Engineering & Applied Sciences, Harvard University, USA","","School of Engineering & Applied Sciences, Harvard University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017334100","1","Michelle Borkin","38017334100","School of Engineering & Applied Sciences, Harvard University, USA","School of Engineering & Applied Sciences, Harvard University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017335100","2","Krzysztof Gajos","38017335100","School of Engineering & Applied Sciences, Harvard University, USA","School of Engineering & Applied Sciences, Harvard University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089115014","3","Amanda Peters","37089115014","Applied Imaging Science Laboratory, USA","Applied Imaging Science Laboratory, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294083800","4","Dimitrios Mitsouras","37294083800","IPCF-CNR, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Italy","IPCF-CNR, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Italy","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37422034400","5","Simone Melchionna","37422034400","Applied Imaging Science Laboratory, USA","Applied Imaging Science Laboratory, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294079000","6","Frank Rybicki","37294079000","Vascular Profiling Laboratory, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, USA","Vascular Profiling Laboratory, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300850800","7","Charles Feldman","37300850800","School of Engineering & Applied Sciences, Harvard University, USA","School of Engineering & Applied Sciences, Harvard University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275698100","8","Hanspeter Pfister","37275698100","","","","","","","110","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.192","2443","2488","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065015/","Quantitative evaluation","qualitative evaluation","biomedical and medical visualization.","","","","","","","Image color analysis","Arteries","Three dimensional displays","Data visualization","Heart","Blood flow","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065015","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","89","2479","Evaluation of Artery Visualizations for Heart Disease Diagnosis","17"
"Providing effective feedback on resource consumption in the home is a key challenge of environmental conservation efforts. One promising approach for providing feedback about residential energy consumption is the use of ambient and artistic visualizations. Pervasive computing technologies enable the integration of such feedback into the home in the form of distributed point-of-consumption feedback devices to support decision-making in everyday activities. However, introducing these devices into the home requires sensitivity to the domestic context. In this paper we describe three abstract visualizations and suggest four design requirements that this type of device must meet to be effective: pragmatic, aesthetic, ambient, and ecological. We report on the findings from a mixed methods user study that explores the viability of using ambient and artistic feedback in the home based on these requirements. Our findings suggest that this approach is a viable way to provide resource use feedback and that both the aesthetics of the representation and the context of use are important elements that must be considered in this design space.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065016/","LOCKED","6065016","School of Interactive Arts Technology, Simon Fraser University, Canada","","School of Interactive Arts Technology, Simon Fraser University, Canada","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399764800","1","Johnny Rodgers","37399764800","School of Interactive Arts Technology, Simon Fraser University, Canada","School of Interactive Arts Technology, Simon Fraser University, Canada","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37353447100","2","Lyn Bartram","37353447100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","74","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.196","1736","2497","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065016/","Ambient visualization","informative art","casual infovis","sustainability","distributed visualization.","","","","","Data visualization","Resource management","Feedback","Real time systems","Art","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065016","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","90","2489","Exploring Ambient and Artistic Visualization for Residential Energy Use Feedback","17"
"Working with three domain specialists we investigate human-centered approaches to geovisualization following an ISO13407 taxonomy covering context of use, requirements and early stages of design. Our case study, undertaken over three years, draws attention to repeating trends: that generic approaches fail to elicit adequate requirements for geovis application design; that the use of real data is key to understanding needs and possibilities; that trust and knowledge must be built and developed with collaborators. These processes take time but modified human-centred approaches can be effective. A scenario developed through contextual inquiry but supplemented with domain data and graphics is useful to geovis designers. Wireframe, paper and digital prototypes enable successful communication between specialist and geovis domains when incorporating real and interesting data, prompting exploratory behaviour and eliciting previously unconsidered requirements. Paper prototypes are particularly successful at eliciting suggestions, especially for novel visualization. Enabling specialists to explore their data freely with a digital prototype is as effective as using a structured task protocol and is easier to administer. Autoethnography has potential for framing the design process. We conclude that a common understanding of context of use, domain data and visualization possibilities are essential to successful geovis design and develop as this progresses. HC approaches can make a significant contribution here. However, modified approaches, applied with flexibility, are most promising. We advise early, collaborative engagement with data - through simple, transient visual artefacts supported by data sketches and existing designs - before moving to successively more sophisticated data wireframes and data prototypes.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065017/","LOCKED","6065017","GiCentre, City University London, UK","","GiCentre, City University London, UK","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38030446400","1","David Lloyd","38030446400","GiCentre, City University London, UK","GiCentre, City University London, UK","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37605079900","2","Jason Dykes","37605079900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","73","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.209","1884","2507","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065017/","Evaluation","geovisualization","context of use","requirements","field study","prototypes","sketching","design.","","Data visualization","Human factors","Taxonomy","Domain specific languages","","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065017","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","91","2498","Human-Centered Approaches in Geovisualization Design: Investigating Multiple Methods Through a Long-Term Case Study","17"
"While it is still most common for information visualization researchers to develop new visualizations from a data- or taskdriven perspective, there is growing interest in understanding the types of visualizations people create by themselves for personal use. As part of this recent direction, we have studied a large collection of whiteboards in a research institution, where people make active use of combinations of words, diagrams and various types of visuals to help them further their thought processes. Our goal is to arrive at a better understanding of the nature of visuals that are created spontaneously during brainstorming, thinking, communicating, and general problem solving on whiteboards. We use the qualitative approaches of open coding, interviewing, and affinity diagramming to explore the use of recognizable and novel visuals, and the interplay between visualization and diagrammatic elements with words, numbers and labels. We discuss the potential implications of our findings on information visualization design.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065018/","LOCKED","6065018","University of Calgary, Canada","","University of Calgary, Canada","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38016653500","1","Jagoda Walny","38016653500","University of Calgary and Microsoft Research, Canada","University of Calgary and Microsoft Research, Canada","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37285000100","2","Sheelagh Carpendale","37285000100","Microsoft Research Limited, UK","Microsoft Research Limited, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38328504500","3","Nathalie Henry Riche","38328504500","Microsoft Research Limited, UK","Microsoft Research Limited, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37312523900","4","Gina Venolia","37312523900","Microsoft Research and University of Washington, USA","Microsoft Research and University of Washington, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017515000","5","Philip Fawcett","38017515000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","49","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.251","1261","2517","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065018/","Visualization","diagrams","whiteboards","observational study.","","","","","","Data visualization","Encoding","Image color analysis","","","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065018","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","92","2508","Visual Thinking In Action: Visualizations As Used On Whiteboards","17"
"We consider moving objects as multivariate time-series. By visually analyzing the attributes, patterns may appear that explain why certain movements have occurred. Density maps as proposed by Scheepens et al. [25] are a way to reveal these patterns by means of aggregations of filtered subsets of trajectories. Since filtering is often not sufficient for analysts to express their domain knowledge, we propose to use expressions instead. We present a flexible architecture for density maps to enable custom, versatile exploration using multiple density fields. The flexibility comes from a script, depicted in this paper as a block diagram, which defines an advanced computation of a density field. We define six different types of blocks to create, compose, and enhance trajectories or density fields. Blocks are customized by means of expressions that allow the analyst to model domain knowledge. The versatility of our architecture is demonstrated with several maritime use cases developed with domain experts. Our approach is expected to be useful for the analysis of objects in other domains.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065019/","LOCKED","6065019","Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands","","Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37846960800","1","Roeland Scheepens","37846960800","Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands","Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37846959300","2","Niels Willems","37846959300","Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands","Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294473300","3","Huub van de Wetering","37294473300","Fraunhofer Institute IAIS, Germany","Fraunhofer Institute IAIS, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047100","4","Gennady Andrienko","37283047100","Fraunhofer Institute IAIS, Germany","Fraunhofer Institute IAIS, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047700","5","Natalia Andrienko","37283047700","Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands","Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267249200","6","Jarke J. van Wijk","37267249200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","100","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.181","1296","2527","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065019/","Trajectories","Kernel Density Estimation","Multivariate Data","Geographical Information Systems","and Raster Maps.","","","","","Trajectory","Computer architecture","Data visualization","Image color analysis","Computational modeling","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065019","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","93","2518","Composite Density Maps for Multivariate Trajectories","17"
"We introduce a focus+context method to visualize a complicated metro map of a modern city on a small displaying area. The context of our work is with regard the popularity of mobile devices. The best route to the destination, which can be obtained from the arrival time of trains, is highlighted. The stations on the route enjoy larger spaces, whereas the other stations are rendered smaller and closer to fit the whole map into a screen. To simplify the navigation and route planning for visitors, we formulate various map characteristics such as octilinear transportation lines and regular station distances into energy terms. We then solve for the optimal layout in a least squares sense. In addition, we label the names of stations that are on the route of a passenger according to human preferences, occlusions, and consistencies of label positions using the graph cuts method. Our system achieves real-time performance by being able to report instant information because of the carefully designed energy terms. We apply our method to layout a number of metro maps and show the results and timing statistics to demonstrate the feasibility of our technique.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065020/","LOCKED","6065020","National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan","","National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407536000","1","Yu-Shuen Wang","37407536000","National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan","National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37552341400","2","Ming-Te Chi","37552341400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","57","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.205","1094","2535","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065020/","Focus+context visualization","metro map","octilinear layout","graph labeling","optimization.","","","","","Layout","Graphics","Optimization","Nonlinear distortion","","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065020","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","94","2528","Focus+Context Metro Maps","17"
"Flow maps are thematic maps that visualize the movement of objects, such as people or goods, between geographic regions. One or more sources are connected to several targets by lines whose thickness corresponds to the amount of flow between a source and a target. Good flow maps reduce visual clutter by merging (bundling) lines smoothly and by avoiding self-intersections. Most flow maps are still drawn by hand and only few automated methods exist. Some of the known algorithms do not support edge-bundling and those that do, cannot guarantee crossing-free flows. We present a new algorithmic method that uses edge-bundling and computes crossing-free flows of high visual quality. Our method is based on so-called spiral trees, a novel type of Steiner tree which uses logarithmic spirals. Spiral trees naturally induce a clustering on the targets and smoothly bundle lines. Our flows can also avoid obstacles, such as map features, region outlines, or even the targets. We demonstrate our approach with extensive experiments.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065021/","LOCKED","6065021","TU Eindhoven, Netherlands","","TU Eindhoven, Netherlands","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37402703700","1","Kevin Buchin","37402703700","TU Eindhoven, Netherlands","TU Eindhoven, Netherlands","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591266000","2","Bettina Speckmann","37591266000","TU Eindhoven, Netherlands","TU Eindhoven, Netherlands","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591265900","3","Kevin Verbeek","37591265900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","88","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.202","1557","2544","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065021/","Flow maps","Automated Cartography","Spiral Trees.","","","","","","","Tree data structures","Cost function","Steiner trees","Cartography","Approximation algorithms","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065021","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","95","2536","Flow Map Layout via Spiral Trees","17"
"Geodemographic classifiers characterise populations by categorising geographical areas according to the demographic and lifestyle characteristics of those who live within them. The dimension-reducing quality of such classifiers provides a simple and effective means of characterising population through a manageable set of categories, but inevitably hides heterogeneity, which varies within and between the demographic categories and geographical areas, sometimes systematically. This may have implications for their use, which is widespread in government and commerce for planning, marketing and related activities. We use novel interactive graphics to delve into OAC – a free and open geodemographic classifier that classifies the UK population in over 200,000 small geographical areas into 7 super-groups, 21 groups and 52 sub-groups. Our graphics provide access to the original 41 demographic variables used in the classification and the uncertainty associated with the classification of each geographical area on-demand. It also supports comparison geographically and by category. This serves the dual purpose of helping understand the classifier itself leading to its more informed use and providing a more comprehensive view of population in a comprehensible manner. We assess the impact of these interactive graphics on experienced OAC users who explored the details of the classification, its uncertainty and the nature of between – and within – class variation and then reflect on their experiences. Visualization of the complexities and subtleties of the classification proved to be a thought-provoking exercise both confirming and challenging usersâ€šÃ„Ã´ understanding of population, the OAC classifier and the way it is used in their organisations. Users identified three contexts for which the techniques were deemed useful in the context of local government, confirming the validity of the proposed methods.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065022/","LOCKED","6065022","City University London, UK","","City University London, UK","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590960700","1","Aidan Slingsby","37590960700","City University London, UK","City University London, UK","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37605079900","2","Jason Dykes","37605079900","City University London, UK","City University London, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399045100","3","Jo Wood","37399045100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","38","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.197","1301","2554","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065022/","Geodemographics","OAC","classification","cartography","uncertainty.","","","","","Demographics","Image color analysis","Visualization","Data visualization","Classification","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065022","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","96","2545","Exploring Uncertainty in Geodemographics with Interactive Graphics","17"
"Mobile users of maps typically need detailed information about their surroundings plus some context information about remote places. In order to avoid that the map partly gets too dense, cartographers have designed mapping functions that enlarge a user-defined focus region - such functions are sometimes called fish-eye projections. The extra map space occupied by the enlarged focus region is compensated by distorting other parts of the map. We argue that, in a map showing a network of roads relevant to the user, distortion should preferably take place in those areas where the network is sparse. Therefore, we do not apply a predefined mapping function. Instead, we consider the road network as a graph whose edges are the road segments. We compute a new spatial mapping with a graph-based optimization approach, minimizing the square sum of distortions at edges. Our optimization method is based on a convex quadratic program (CQP); CQPs can be solved in polynomial time. Important requirements on the output map are expressed as linear inequalities. In particular, we show how to forbid edge crossings. We have implemented our method in a prototype tool. For instances of different sizes, our method generated output maps that were far less distorted than those generated with a predefined fish-eye projection. Future work is needed to automate the selection of roads relevant to the user. Furthermore, we aim at fast heuristics for application in real-time systems.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065023/","LOCKED","6065023","Computer Science I, University of Würzburg, Wurzburg, Germany","","Computer Science I, University of Würzburg, Wurzburg, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017278900","1","Jan-Henrik Haunert","38017278900","Computer Science I, University of Würzburg, Wurzburg, Germany","Computer Science I, University of Würzburg, Wurzburg, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089322264","2","Leon Sering","37089322264","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","40","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.191","808","2562","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065023/","Cartography","schematic maps","fish-eye view","graph drawing","optimization","quadratic programming.","","","","Cartography","Optimization","Image analysis","Visualization","Distortion measurement","Graphics","Quadratic programming","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065023","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","97","2555","Drawing Road Networks with Focus Regions","17"
"Multidimensional projection techniques have experienced many improvements lately, mainly regarding computational times and accuracy. However, existing methods do not yet provide flexible enough mechanisms for visualization-oriented fully interactive applications. This work presents a new multidimensional projection technique designed to be more flexible and versatile than other methods. This novel approach, called Local Affine Multidimensional Projection (LAMP), relies on orthogonal mapping theory to build accurate local transformations that can be dynamically modified according to user knowledge. The accuracy, flexibility and computational efficiency of LAMP is confirmed by a comprehensive set of comparisons. LAMP's versatility is exploited in an application which seeks to correlate data that, in principle, has no connection as well as in visual exploration of textual documents.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065024/","LOCKED","6065024","Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil","","Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017343000","1","Paulo Joia","38017343000","Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil","Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017342500","2","Danilo Coimbra","38017342500","Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil","Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37680742400","3","Jose A.

"Parallel coordinates is a popular and well-known multivariate data visualization technique. However, one of their inherent limitations has to do with the rendering of very large data sets. This often causes an overplotting problem and the goal of the visual information seeking mantra is hampered because of a cluttered overview and non-interactive update rates. In this paper, we propose two novel solutions, namely, angular histograms and attribute curves. These techniques are frequency-based approaches to large, high-dimensional data visualization. They are able to convey both the density of underlying polylines and their slopes. Angular histogram and attribute curves offer an intuitive way for the user to explore the clustering, linear correlations and outliers in large data sets without the over-plotting and clutter problems associated with traditional parallel coordinates. We demonstrate the results on a wide variety of data sets including real-world, high-dimensional biological data. Finally, we compare our methods with the other popular frequency-based algorithms.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065025/","LOCKED","6065025","Visual Computing Group, Swansea University, UK","","Visual Computing Group, Swansea University, UK","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38031256500","1","Zhao Geng","38031256500","Visual Computing Group, Swansea University, UK","Visual Computing Group, Swansea University, UK","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38024566900","2","ZhenMin Peng","38024566900","Swansea University, UK","Swansea University, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087363988","3","Robert S.Laramee","37087363988","Bangor University, UK","Bangor University, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087364188","4","Jonathan C.

"Clustering as a fundamental data analysis technique has been widely used in many analytic applications. However, it is often difficult for users to understand and evaluate multidimensional clustering results, especially the quality of clusters and their semantics. For large and complex data, high-level statistical information about the clusters is often needed for users to evaluate cluster quality while a detailed display of multidimensional attributes of the data is necessary to understand the meaning of clusters. In this paper, we introduce DICON, an icon-based cluster visualization that embeds statistical information into a multi-attribute display to facilitate cluster interpretation, evaluation, and comparison. We design a treemap-like icon to represent a multidimensional cluster, and the quality of the cluster can be conveniently evaluated with the embedded statistical information. We further develop a novel layout algorithm which can generate similar icons for similar clusters, making comparisons of clusters easier. User interaction and clutter reduction are integrated into the system to help users more effectively analyze and refine clustering results for large datasets. We demonstrate the power of DICON through a user study and a case study in the healthcare domain. Our evaluation shows the benefits of the technique, especially in support of complex multidimensional cluster analysis.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065026/","LOCKED","6065026","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604309600","1","Nan Cao","37604309600","IBM Thomas J.

"In many application fields, data analysts have to deal with datasets that contain many expressions per item. The effective analysis of such multivariate datasets is dependent on the user's ability to understand both the intrinsic dimensionality of the dataset as well as the distribution of the dependent values with respect to the dimensions. In this paper, we propose a visualization model that enables the joint interactive visual analysis of multivariate datasets with respect to their dimensions as well as with respect to the actual data values. We describe a dual setting of visualization and interaction in items space and in dimensions space. The visualization of items is linked to the visualization of dimensions with brushing and focus+context visualization. With this approach, the user is able to jointly study the structure of the dimensions space as well as the distribution of data items with respect to the dimensions. Even though the proposed visualization model is general, we demonstrate its application in the context of a DNA microarray data analysis.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065027/","LOCKED","6065027","Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Norway","","Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Norway","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37567685600","1","Cagatay Turkay","37567685600","Department of Statistics and Probability Theory, Vienna University of Technology, Austria","Department of Statistics and Probability Theory, Vienna University of Technology, Austria","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017354300","2","Peter Filzmoser","38017354300","Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Norway","Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Norway","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274158800","3","Helwig Hauser","37274158800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","63","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.178","1481","2599","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065027/","Interactive visual analysis","High-dimensional data analysis.","","","","","","","","Data visualization","Principal component analysis","Analytical models","Data models","Computational modeling","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065027","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","101","2591","Brushing Dimensions - A Dual Visual Analysis Model for High-Dimensional Data","17"
"We present MoleView, a novel technique for interactive exploration of multivariate relational data. Given a spatial embedding of the data, in terms of a scatter plot or graph layout, we propose a semantic lens which selects a specific spatial and attribute-related data range. The lens keeps the selected data in focus unchanged and continuously deforms the data out of the selection range in order to maintain the context around the focus. Specific deformations include distance-based repulsion of scatter plot points, deforming straight-line node-link graph drawings, and as varying the simplification degree of bundled edge graph layouts. Using a brushing-based technique, we further show the applicability of our semantic lens for scenarios requiring a complex selection of the zones of interest. Our technique is simple to implement and provides real-time performance on large datasets. We demonstrate our technique with actual data from air and road traffic control, medical imaging, and software comprehension applications.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065028/","LOCKED","6065028","DGAC/DTI Research and Development, ENAC, University of Toulouse, France","","DGAC/DTI Research and Development, ENAC, University of Toulouse, France","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017336200","1","Christophe Hurter","38017336200","University of Groningen, Netherlands","University of Groningen, Netherlands","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268047100","2","Alexandru Telea","37268047100","University of Groningen, Netherlands","University of Groningen, Netherlands","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37672044200","3","Ozan Ersoy","37672044200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","47","7","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2011.223","808","2609","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065028/","Semantic lenses","magic lenses","graph bundling","attribute filtering.","","","","","","Lenses","Semantics","Filtering theory","Shape analysis","Data visualization","","","","20111103","6064926","2160-9306","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065028","Dec. 2011","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2011","IEEE","102","2600","MoleView: An Attribute and Structure-Based Semantic Lens for Large Element-Based Plots","17"
