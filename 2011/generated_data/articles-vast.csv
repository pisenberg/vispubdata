"Visual analytics, “the science of analytical reasoning facilitated by visual interactive interfaces” [5], puts high demands on the applications visualization as well as interaction capabilities. Due to their size large high-resolution screens have become popular display devices, especially when used in collaborative data analysis scenarios. However, traditional interaction methods based on combinations of computer mice and keyboards often do not scale to the number of users or the size of the display. Modern smart phones featuring multi-modal input/output and considerable memory offer a way to address these issues. In the last couple of years they have become common everyday life gadgets. In this paper we conduct an extensive user study comparing the experience of test candidates when using traditional input devices and metaphors with the one when using new smart phone based techniques, like multi-modal drag and tilt. Candidates were asked to complete various interaction tasks relevant for most applications on a large, monitor-based, high-resolution tiled wall system. Our study evaluates both user performance and satisfaction, identifying strengths and weaknesses of the researched interaction methods in specific tasks. Results reveal good performance of users in certain tasks when using the new interaction techniques. Even first-time users were able to complete a task faster with the smart phone than with traditional devices.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102466/","LOCKED","6102466","Computer Graphics & HCI Lab, University of Kaiserslautern, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38238582800","1","Jens Bauer","38238582800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Graphics & HCI Lab, University of Kaiserslautern, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37646534700","2","Sebastian Thelen","37646534700","Computer Graphics & HCI Lab, University of Kaiserslautern, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282550400","3","Achim Ebert","37282550400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","23-28 Oct. 2011","Providence, RI, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2011.6102466","266","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102466/","","","","","","","","","","Smart phones","Mice","Keyboards","Performance evaluation","Stacking","Computers","Three dimensional displays","6102423","978-1-4673-0015-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0015-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0014-8","11EX5936","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102466","23-28 Oct. 2011","6093899","2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2011","IEEE","2","265","Evaluation of large display interaction using smart phones"
"Concerns about verification mean the humanitarian community are reluctant to use information collected during crisis events, even though such information could potentially enhance the response effort. Consequently, a program of research is presented that aims to evaluate the degree to which uncertainty and bias are found in public collections of incident reports gathered during crisis events. These datasets exemplify a class whose members have spatial and temporal attributes, are gathered from heterogeneous sources, and do not have readily available attribution information. An interactive software prototype, and existing software, are applied to a dataset related to the current armed conflict in Libya to identify `intrinsic' characteristics against which uncertainty and bias can be evaluated. Requirements on the prototype are identified, which in time will be expanded into full research objectives.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102470/","LOCKED","6102470","giCentre, School of Informatics, City University London, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233564700","1","Iain Dillingham","38233564700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","giCentre, School of Informatics, City University London, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37605079900","2","Jason Dykes","37605079900","giCentre, School of Informatics, City University London, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399045100","3","Jo Wood","37399045100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","23-28 Oct. 2011","Providence, RI, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2011.6102470","274","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102470/","","","","","","","","","","Uncertainty","Software","Data visualization","Information science","Visualization","Prototypes","User-generated content","6102423","978-1-4673-0015-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0015-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0014-8","11EX5936","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102470","23-28 Oct. 2011","6093899","2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2011","IEEE","3","273","Visual analytical approaches to evaluating uncertainty and bias in crowd sourced crisis information"
"Chi showed how to treat visualization programing models abstractly. This provided a firm theoretical basis for the data-state model of visualization. However, Chi's models did not look deeper into fine-grained program properties, such as execution semantics. We present conditionally deterministic and resource bounded semantics for the data flow model of visualization based on E-FRP. These semantics are used in the Stencil system to move between data state and data flow execution, build task-based parallelism, and build complex analysis chains for dynamic data. This initial work also shows promise for other complex operators, compilation techniques to enable efficient use of time and space, and mixing task and data parallelism.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102468/","LOCKED","6102468","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546825800","1","Joseph A.

"Twitter currently receives about 190 million tweets (small text-based Web posts) a day, in which people share their comments regarding a wide range of topics. A large number of tweets include opinions about products and services. However, with Twitter being a relatively new phenomenon, these tweets are underutilized as a source for evaluating customer sentiment. To explore high-volume twitter data, we introduce three novel time-based visual sentiment analysis techniques: (1) topic-based sentiment analysis that extracts, maps, and measures customer opinions; (2) stream analysis that identifies interesting tweets based on their density, negativity, and influence characteristics; and (3) pixel cell-based sentiment calendars and high density geo maps that visualize large volumes of data in a single view. We applied these techniques to a variety of twitter data, (e.g., movies, amusement parks, and hotels) to show their distribution and patterns, and to identify influential opinions.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102472/","LOCKED","6102472","Hewlett-Packard Labs, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37069334200","1","Ming Hao","37069334200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hewlett-Packard Labs, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601356700","2","Christian Rohrdantz","37601356700","Hewlett-Packard Labs, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37594026300","3","Halldór Janetzko","37594026300","Hewlett-Packard Labs, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275646700","4","Umeshwar Dayal","37275646700","Hewlett-Packard Labs, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","5","Daniel A.

"This paper studies the interpretability of transformations of labeled higher dimensional data into a 2D representation (scatterplots) for visual classification.1In this context, the term interpretability has two components: the interpretability of the visualization (the image itself) and the interpretability of the visualization axes (the data transformation functions). We define a data transformation function as any linear or non-linear function of the original variables mapping the data into 1D. Even for a small dataset, the space of possible data transformations is beyond the limit of manual exploration, therefore it is important to develop automated techniques that capture both aspects of interpretability so that they can be used to guide the search process without human intervention. The goal of the search process is to find a smaller number of interpretable data transformations for the users to explore. We briefly discuss how we used such automated measures in an evolutionary computing based data dimensionality reduction application for visual analytics. In this paper, we present a two-part user study in which we separately investigated how humans rated the visualizations of labeled data and comprehensibility of mathematical expressions that could be used as data transformation functions. In the first part, we compared human perception with a number of automated measures from the machine learning and visual analytics literature. In the second part, we studied how various structural properties of an expression related to its interpretability.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102474/","LOCKED","6102474","The Graduate Center, The City University of New York, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233506100","1","Ilknur Icke","38233506100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","The Graduate Center, The City University of New York, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38236481600","2","Andrew Rosenberg","38236481600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","6","23-28 Oct. 2011","Providence, RI, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2011.6102474","282","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102474/","data transformation","visualization","user study","","","","","","","Indexes","Humans","Visualization","Data visualization","Support vector machines","Particle measurements","Atmospheric measurements","6102423","978-1-4673-0015-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0015-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0014-8","11EX5936","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102474","23-28 Oct. 2011","6093899","2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2011","IEEE","6","281","Automated measures for interpretable dimensionality reduction for visual classification: A user study"

"Graph rewriting systems are easily described and explained. They can be seen as a game where one iterates transformation rules on an initial graph, until some condition is met. A rule describes a local pattern (i.e. a subgraph) that must be identified in a graph and specifies how to transform this subgraph. The graph rewriting formalism is at the same time extremely rich and complex, making the study of a model expressed in terms of graph rewriting quite challenging. For instance, predicting whether rules can be applied in any order is often difficult. When modelling complex systems, graphical formalisms have clear advantages: they are more intuitive and make it easier to visualize a system and convey intuitions about it. This work focuses on the design of an interactive visual graph rewriting system which supports graphical manipulations and computation to reason and simulate on a system. PORGY has been designed based on regular exchanges with graph rewriting systems experts and users over the past three years. The design choices relied on a careful methodology inspired from Munzner's nested process model for visualization design and validation [4].","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102480/","LOCKED","6102480","University of Bordeaux and INRIA Bordeaux Sud-Ouest, France","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396011000","1","Bruno Pinaud","37396011000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Bordeaux and INRIA Bordeaux Sud-Ouest, France","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38269861900","2","Jonathan Dubois","38269861900","University of Bordeaux and INRIA Bordeaux Sud-Ouest, France","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283186100","3","Guy Melançon","37283186100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","0","23-28 Oct. 2011","Providence, RI, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2011.6102480","294","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102480/","","","","","","","","","","Visualization","Biological system modeling","Layout","Computational modeling","History","Calculus","","6102423","978-1-4673-0015-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0015-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0014-8","11EX5936","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102480","23-28 Oct. 2011","6093899","2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2011","IEEE","8","293","PORGY: Interactive and visual reasoning with graph rewriting systems"
"Faced with a large, high-dimensional dataset, many turn to data analysis approaches that they understand less well than the domain of their data. An expert's knowledge can be leveraged into many types of analysis via a domain-specific distance function, but creating such a function is not intuitive to do by hand. We have created a system that shows an initial visualization, adapts to user feedback, and produces a distance function as a result. Specifically, we present a multidimensional scaling (MDS) visualization and an iterative feedback mechanism for a user to affect the distance function that informs the visualization without having to adjust the parameters of the visualization directly. An encouraging experimental result suggests that using this tool, data attributes with useless data are given low importance in the distance function.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102478/","LOCKED","6102478","Tufts University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38239756300","1","Jingjing Liu","38239756300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Tufts University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38237586900","2","Eli T.

"We present a visual analysis tool for mining correlations in county-level, multidimensional gun/homicide data. The tool uses 2D pexels, heatmaps, linked-views, dynamic queries and details-on-demand to analyze annual county-level data on firearm homicide rates and gun availability, as well as various socio-demographic measures. A statistical significance filter was implemented as a visual means to validate exploratory hypotheses. Results from expert evaluations indicate that our methods outperform typical graphical techniques used by statisticians, such as bar graphs, scatterplots and residual plots, to show spatial and temporal relationships. Our visualization has the potential to convey the impact of gun availability on firearm homicides to the public health arena and the general public.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102482/","LOCKED","6102482","Department of Statistics, University of Pittsburgh, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37317865100","1","Scott D.

"Projection Pursuit has been an effective method for finding interesting low-dimensional (usually 2D) projections in multidimensional spaces. Unfortunately, projection pursuit is not scalable to high-dimensional spaces. We introduce a novel method for approximating the results of projection pursuit to find class-separating views by using random projections. We build an analytic visualization platform based on this algorithm that is scalable to extremely large problems. Then, we discuss its extension to the recognition of other noteworthy configurations in high-dimensional spaces.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102465/","LOCKED","6102465","Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Chicago, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37548165700","1","Anushka Anand","37548165700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Chicago, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37560536200","2","Leland Wilkinson","37560536200","Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Chicago, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606167900","3","Tuan Nhon Dang","37606167900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","0","23-28 Oct. 2011","Providence, RI, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2011.6102465","264","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102465/","","","","","","","","","","Data models","Context modeling","Data mining","Visual analytics","Handwriting recognition","Electronic mail","Cancer","6102423","978-1-4673-0015-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0015-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0014-8","11EX5936","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102465","23-28 Oct. 2011","6093899","2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2011","IEEE","17","263","Using random projections to identify class-separating variables in high-dimensional spaces"
"It is a laborious process to quantify relationship patterns within a feature-rich archive. For example, understanding the degree of neuroanatomical similarity between the scanned subjects of a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) repository is a nontrivial task. In this work we present a Coordinated Multiple View (CMV) system for visually analyzing collections of feature-rich datasets. A query-based user interface operates on a feature-respective data scheme, and is geared towards domain experts that are non-specialists in informatics and analytics. We employ multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) to project feature surface representations into three-dimensions, where proximity in location is proportional to the feature similarity. Through query feedback and environment navigation, the user groups clusters that exhibit probable trends across feature and attribute. The system provides supervised classification methods for determining attribute classes within the user selected groups. Finally, using visual or analytical feature-wise exploration the user determines intra-group feature commonality.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102467/","LOCKED","6102467","Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, University of California Los Angeles, 90034, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37603001800","1","Ian Bowman","37603001800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, University of California Los Angeles, 90034, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37288595800","2","Shantanu H.

"It is common to classify data in hierarchies, they provide a comprehensible way of understanding big amounts of data. From budgets to organizational charts or even the stock market, trees are everywhere and people find them easy to use. However when analysts need to compare two versions of the same tree structure, or two related taxonomies, the task is not so easy. Much work has been done on this topic, but almost all of it has been restricted to either compare the trees by topology, or by the node attribute values. With this project we are proposing TreeVersity, a framework for comparing tree structures, both by structural changes and by differences in the node attributes. This paper is based on our previous work on comparing traffic agencies using LifeFlow [1, 2] and on a first prototype of TreeVersity.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102471/","LOCKED","6102471","HCIL & Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38319608500","1","John Alexis Guerra Gómez","38319608500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Department of Art, University of Maryland, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38326034700","2","Audra Buck-Coleman","38326034700","HCIL & UMIACS, University of Maryland, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283026800","3","Catherine Plaisant","37283026800","HCIL & Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283016400","4","Ben Shneiderman","37283016400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","23-28 Oct. 2011","Providence, RI, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2011.6102471","276","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102471/","","","","","","","","","","Vegetation","Data visualization","Visualization","Educational institutions","Image color analysis","Computer science","Topology","6102423","978-1-4673-0015-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0015-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0014-8","11EX5936","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102471","23-28 Oct. 2011","6093899","2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2011","IEEE","19","275","TreeVersity: Comparing tree structures by topology and node's attributes differences"
"Agent-based simulation has become a key technique for modeling and simulating dynamic, complicated behaviors in social and behavioral sciences. Lacking the appropriate tools and support, it is difficult for social scientists to thoroughly analyze the results of these simulations. In this work, we capture the complex relationships between discrete simulation states by visualizing the data as a temporal graph. In collaboration with expert analysts, we identify two graph structures which capture important relationships between pivotal states in the simulation and their inevitable outcomes. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of these structures in the interactive analysis of a large-scale social science simulation of political power in present-day Thailand.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102469/","LOCKED","6102469","Tufts University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38229914800","1","R.

"Recent work in visual analytics has explored the extent to which information regarding analyst action and reasoning can be inferred from interaction. However, these methods typically rely on humans instead of automatic extraction techniques. Furthermore, there is little discussion regarding the role of user frustration when interacting with a visual interface. We demonstrate that automatic extraction of user frustration is possible given action-level visualization interaction logs. An experiment is described which collects data that accurately reflects user emotion transitions and corresponding interaction sequences. This data is then used in building HiddenMarkov Models (HMMs) which statistically connect interaction events with frustration. The capabilities of HMMs in predicting user frustration are tested using standard machine learning evaluation methods. The resulting classifier serves as a suitable predictor of user frustration that performs similarly across different users and datasets.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102473/","LOCKED","6102473","Computer Science, UNC-Charlotte, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546111900","1","Lane Harrison","37546111900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science, UNC-Charlotte, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606064200","2","Wenwen Dou","37606064200","Computer Science, UNC-Charlotte, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37545504600","3","Aidong Lu","37545504600","Computer Science, UNC-Charlotte, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300425000","4","William Ribarsky","37300425000","Computer Science, UNC-Charlotte, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601069300","5","Xiaoyu Wang","37601069300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3","0","23-28 Oct. 2011","Providence, RI, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2011.6102473","280","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102473/","","","","","","","","","","Hidden Markov models","Humans","Data visualization","Accuracy","Visual analytics","Predictive models","Face","6102423","978-1-4673-0015-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0015-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0014-8","11EX5936","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102473","23-28 Oct. 2011","6093899","2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2011","IEEE","21","279","Analysts aren't machines: Inferring frustration through visualization interaction"

"The researchers explore the intersections between Information Assurance and Risk using visual analysis of text mining operations. The methodological approach involves searching for and extracting for analysis those abstracts and keywords groupings that relate to risk within a defined subset of scientific research journals. This analysis is conducted through a triangulated study incorporating visualizations produced using both Starlight and In-Spire visual analysis software. The results are definitional, showing current attitudes within the Information Assurance research community towards risk management strategies, while simultaneously demonstrating the value of visual analysis processes when engaging in sense making of a large body of knowledge.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102477/","LOCKED","6102477","University of British Columbia, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38279266800","1","Victoria Lemieux","38279266800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Washington, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38276808600","2","Barbara Endicott-Popovsky","38276808600","University of Washington, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38293285300","3","Karl Eckler","38293285300","University of British Columbia, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38305609100","4","Thomas Dang","38305609100","University of British Columbia, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37990064400","5","Adam Jansen","37990064400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","23-28 Oct. 2011","Providence, RI, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2011.6102477","288","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102477/","Risk","Risk Management","Information Assurance","Information Security","Visual Analysis","","","","","Visualization","Educational institutions","Databases","Abstracts","Availability","Security","Taxonomy","6102423","978-1-4673-0015-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0015-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0014-8","11EX5936","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102477","23-28 Oct. 2011","6093899","2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2011","IEEE","23","287","Visualizing an information assurance risk taxonomy"

On an overview level, the visualization of various measures conveys pair-wise relationships between categorical dimensions. For more details, interaction supports to relate a single category to all categories of multiple dimensions. We discuss methods for representing relationships and visualization-driven strategies for ordering dimensions and categories, and we illustrate the approach by means of data from a social survey.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102481/","LOCKED","6102481","VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282562500","1","Harald Piringer","37282562500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233558900","2","Matthias Buchetics","38233558900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2","0","23-28 Oct. 2011","Providence, RI, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2011.6102481","296","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102481/","","","","","","","","","","Data visualization","Joints","Visualization","Layout","Probability","USA Councils","Bars","6102423","978-1-4673-0015-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0015-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0014-8","11EX5936","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102481","23-28 Oct. 2011","6093899","2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2011","IEEE","24","295","Exploring proportions: Comparative visualization of categorical data"

"For the VAST 2011 Network Security Mini-Challenge, we adopted geovisual analytic methods and applied them in the field of network security. We used the GeoViz Toolkit [1] to represent cyber security events, by fabricating a simple “geography” of several sets of blocks (one for the workstations, one for the servers, and one for the Internet) using ArcGIS 10 (by ESRI - Environmental System Research Institute). Security data was tabulated using Perl scripts to parse the logs in order to create representations of event frequency and where they occurred on the network. The tabulated security data was then added as attributes of the geography. Exploration of the data and subsequent analysis of the meaning and impact of the cyber security events was made possible using the GeoViz Toolkit.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102491/","LOCKED","6102491","College of Information Sciences and Technology, The Pennsylvania State University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37595223800","1","Nicklaus A.

"Diagnosing a large-scale sensor network is a crucial but challenging task. Particular challenges include the resource and bandwidth constraints on sensor nodes, the spatiotemporally dynamic network behaviors, and the lack of accurate models to understand such behaviors in a hostile environment. In this paper, we present the Sensor Anomaly Visualization Engine (SAVE), a system that fully leverages the power of both visualization and anomaly detection analytics to guide the user to quickly and accurately diagnose sensor network failures and faults. SAVE combines customized visualizations over separate sensor data facets as multiple coordinated views. Temporal expansion model, correlation graph and dynamic projection views are proposed to effectively interpret the topological, correlational and dimensional sensor data dynamics and their anomalies. Through a case study with real-world sensor network system and administrators, we demonstrate that SAVE is able to help better locate the system problem and further identify the root cause of major sensor network failure scenarios.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102458/","LOCKED","6102458","IBM Research - China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37287511900","1","Lei Shi","37287511900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering Department, University of Notre Dame, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37543450800","2","Qi Liao","37543450800","Computer Science and Engineering Department, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, HK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37398853200","3","Yuan He","37398853200","Computer Science and Technology Department, Xi'an Jiao Tong University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38240137400","4","Rui Li","38240137400","Computer Science and Engineering Department, University of Notre Dame, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37298955400","5","Aaron Striegel","37298955400","IBM Research - China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37588016000","6","Zhong Su","37588016000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","18","0","23-28 Oct. 2011","Providence, RI, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2011.6102458","210","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102458/","","","","","","","","","","Routing","Data visualization","Correlation","Network topology","Time series analysis","Wireless sensor networks","Topology","6102423","978-1-4673-0015-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0015-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0014-8","11EX5936","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102458","23-28 Oct. 2011","6093899","2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2011","IEEE","31","201","SAVE: Sensor anomaly visualization engine"
"To make decisions about the long-term preservation and access of large digital collections, archivists gather information such as the collections' contents, their organizational structure, and their file format composition. To date, the process of analyzing a collection - from data gathering to exploratory analysis and final conclusions - has largely been conducted using pen and paper methods. To help archivists analyze large-scale digital collections for archival purposes, we developed an interactive visual analytics application.

"We have observed increasing interest in visual analytics tools and their applications in investigative analysis. Despite the growing interest and substantial studies regarding the topic, understanding the major roadblocks of using such tools from novice users' perspectives is still limited. Therefore, we attempted to identify such “visual analytic roadblocks” for novice users in an investigative analysis scenario. To achieve this goal, we reviewed the existing models, theories, and frameworks that could explain the cognitive processes of human-visualization interaction in investigative analysis. Then, we conducted a qualitative experiment with six novice participants, using a slightly modified version of pair analytics, and analyzed the results through the open-coding method. As a result, we came up with four visual analytic roadblocks and explained these roadblocks using existing cognitive models and theories. We also provided design suggestions to overcome these roadblocks.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102435/","LOCKED","6102435","Purdue University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38235486800","1","Bum chul Kwon","38235486800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Simon Fraser University, Canada","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267458000","2","Brian Fisher","37267458000","Purdue University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38238292000","3","Ji Soo Yi","38238292000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","14","0","23-28 Oct. 2011","Providence, RI, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2011.6102435","11","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102435/","Visual analytics","investigative analysis","cognitive model","framework","roadblock","qualitative experiment","","","","Visual analytics","Analytical models","Humans","Context","Cognition","Calendars","","6102423","978-1-4673-0015-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0015-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0014-8","11EX5936","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102435","23-28 Oct. 2011","6093899","2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2011","IEEE","33","3","Visual analytic roadblocks for novice investigators"
"In recent years diverse quality measures to support the exploration of high-dimensional data sets have been proposed. Such measures can be very useful to rank and select information-bearing projections of very high dimensional data, when the visual exploration of all possible projections becomes unfeasible. But even though a ranking of the low dimensional projections may support the user in the visual exploration task, different measures deliver different distances between the views that do not necessarily match the expectations of human perception. As an alternative solution, we propose a perception-based approach that, similar to the existing measures, can be used to select information bearing projections of the data. Specifically, we construct a perceptual embedding for the different projections based on the data from a psychophysics study and multi-dimensional scaling. This embedding together with a ranking function is then used to estimate the value of the projections for a specific user task in a perceptual sense.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102437/","LOCKED","6102437","TU Braunschweig, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37603943800","1","Georgia Albuquerque","37603943800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TU Braunschweig, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546817000","2","Martin Eisemann","37546817000","TU Braunschweig, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273816400","3","Marcus Magnor","37273816400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","24","0","23-28 Oct. 2011","Providence, RI, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2011.6102437","20","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102437/","","","","","","","","","","Correlation","Visualization","Training","Data visualization","Humans","Atmospheric measurements","Particle measurements","6102423","978-1-4673-0015-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0015-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0014-8","11EX5936","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102437","23-28 Oct. 2011","6093899","2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2011","IEEE","34","13","Perception-based visual quality measures"
"The study of complex activities such as scientific production and software development often require modeling connections among heterogeneous entities including people, institutions and artifacts. Despite numerous advances in algorithms and visualization techniques for understanding such social networks, the process of constructing network models and performing exploratory analysis remains difficult and time-consuming. In this paper we present Orion, a system for interactive modeling, transformation and visualization of network data. Orion's interface enables the rapid manipulation of large graphs-including the specification of complex linking relationships-using simple drag-and-drop operations with desired node types. Orion maps these user interactions to statements in a declarative workflow language that incorporates both relational operators (e.g., selection, aggregation and joins) and network analytics (e.g., centrality measures). We demonstrate how these features enable analysts to flexibly construct and compare networks in domains such as online health communities, academic collaboration and distributed software development.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102441/","LOCKED","6102441","Stanford University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550791300","1","Jeffrey Heer","37550791300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IBM Research, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294938400","2","Adam Perer","37294938400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","13","0","23-28 Oct. 2011","Providence, RI, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2011.6102441","60","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102441/","social network analysis","data management","data transformation","graphs","visualization","end-user programming","","","","Joining processes","Data models","Data visualization","Communities","Analytical models","Social network services","","6102423","978-1-4673-0015-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0015-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0014-8","11EX5936","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102441","23-28 Oct. 2011","6093899","2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2011","IEEE","35","51","Orion: A system for modeling, transformation and visualization of multidimensional heterogeneous networks"
"Traditionally, the visual analysis of hierarchies, respectively, trees, is conducted by focusing on one given hierarchy. However, in many research areas multiple, differing hierarchies need to be analyzed simultaneously in a comparative way - in particular to highlight differences between them, which sometimes can be subtle. A prominent example is the analysis of so-called phylogenetic trees in biology, reflecting hierarchical evolutionary relationships among a set of organisms. Typically, the analysis considers multiple phylogenetic trees, either to account for statistical significance or for differences in derivation of such evolutionary hierarchies; for example, based on different input data, such as the 16S ribosomal RNA and protein sequences of highly conserved enzymes. The simultaneous analysis of a collection of such trees leads to more insight into the evolutionary process. We introduce a novel visual analytics approach for the comparison of multiple hierarchies focusing on both global and local structures. A new tree comparison score has been elaborated for the identification of interesting patterns. We developed a set of linked hierarchy views showing the results of automatic tree comparison on various levels of details. This combined approach offers detailed assessment of local and global tree similarities. The approach was developed in close cooperation with experts from the evolutionary biology domain. We apply it to a phylogenetic data set on bacterial ancestry, demonstrating its application benefit.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102439/","LOCKED","6102439","Interactive-Graphics Systems, TU Darmstadt, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586274500","1","Sebastian Bremm","37586274500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Interactive-Graphics Systems, TU Darmstadt, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586276100","2","Tatiana von Landesberger","37586276100","Interactive-Graphics Systems, TU Darmstadt, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086636530","3","Martin Heß","37086636530","Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282557600","4","Tobias Schreck","37282557600","Computational Biology, TU Darmstadt, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086895876","5","Philipp Weil","37086895876","Computational Biology, TU Darmstadt, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086896187","6","Kay Hamacherk","37086896187","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","38","2","23-28 Oct. 2011","Providence, RI, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2011.6102439","40","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102439/","","","","","","","","","","Visualization","Phylogeny","Vegetation","Image color analysis","Data visualization","Organisms","","6102423","978-1-4673-0015-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0015-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0014-8","11EX5936","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102439","23-28 Oct. 2011","6093899","2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2011","IEEE","36","31","Interactive visual comparison of multiple trees"
"As people continue to author and share increasing amounts of information in social media, the opportunity to leverage such information for relationship discovery tasks increases. In this paper, we describe a set of systems that mine, aggregate, and infer a social graph from social media inside an enterprise, resulting in over 73 million relationships between 450,000 people. We then describe SaNDVis, a novel visual analytics tool that supports people-centric tasks like expertise location, team building, and team coordination in the enterprise. We also provide details of a 12-month-long, large-scale deployment to almost 1,800 users from which we extract dominant use cases from log and interview data. By integrating social position, evidence, and facets into SaNDVis, we demonstrate how users can use a visual analytics tool to reflect on existing relationships as well as build new relationships in an enterprise setting.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102443/","LOCKED","6102443","IBM Research, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294938400","1","Adam Perer","37294938400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IBM Research, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37826398500","2","Ido Guy","37826398500","IBM Research, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233626100","3","Erel Uziel","38233626100","IBM Research, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38232518800","4","Inbal Ronen","38232518800","IBM Research, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37990793800","5","Michal Jacovi","37990793800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","17","8","23-28 Oct. 2011","Providence, RI, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2011.6102443","79","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102443/","information discovery","social networks","social data mining","social visualization","","","","","","Social network services","Visual analytics","Tagging","Internet","Databases","Blogs","Information services","6102423","978-1-4673-0015-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0015-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0014-8","11EX5936","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102443","23-28 Oct. 2011","6093899","2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2011","IEEE","37","71","Visual social network analytics for relationship discovery in the enterprise"
"Existing research suggests that individual personality differences are correlated with a user's speed and accuracy in solving problems with different types of complex visualization systems. In this paper, we extend this research by isolating factors in personality traits as well as in the visualizations that could have contributed to the observed correlation. We focus on a personality trait known as “locus of control,” which represents a person's tendency to see themselves as controlled by or in control of external events. To isolate variables of the visualization design, we control extraneous factors such as color, interaction, and labeling, and specifically focus on the overall layout style of the visualizations. We conduct a user study with four visualizations that gradually shift from an indentation metaphor to a containment metaphor and compare the participants' speed, accuracy, and preference with their locus of control. Our findings demonstrate that there is indeed a correlation between the two: participants with an internal locus of control perform more poorly with visualizations that employ a containment metaphor, while those with an external locus of control perform well with such visualizations. We discuss a possible explanation for this relationship based in cognitive psychology and propose that these results can be used to better understand how people use visualizations and how to adapt visual analytics design to an individual user's needs.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102445/","LOCKED","6102445","Brown University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37548028800","1","Caroline Ziemkiewicz","37548028800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Tufts University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38229914800","2","R.

"Asynchronous Collaborative Visual Analytics (ACVA) leverages group sensemaking by releasing the constraints on when, where, and who works collaboratively. A significant task to be addressed before ACVA can reach its full potential is effective common ground construction, namely the process in which users evaluate insights from individual work to develop a shared understanding of insights and collectively pool them. This is challenging due to the lack of instant communication and scale of collaboration in ACVA. We propose a novel visual analytics approach that automatically gathers, organizes, and summarizes insights to form common ground with reduced human effort. The rich set of visualization and interaction techniques provided in our approach allows users to effectively and flexibly control the common ground construction and review, explore, and compare insights in detail. A working prototype of the approach has been implemented. We have conducted a case study and a user study to demonstrate its effectiveness.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102447/","LOCKED","6102447","University of North Carolina at Charlotte, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37600587200","1","Yang Chen","37600587200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Kent State University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37846905500","2","Jamal Alsakran","37846905500","University of North Carolina at Charlotte, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591128900","3","Scott Barlowe","37591128900","University of North Carolina at Charlotte, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37292632600","4","Jing Yang","37292632600","Kent State University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37277701200","5","Ye Zhao","37277701200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10","1","23-28 Oct. 2011","Providence, RI, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2011.6102447","110","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102447/","Visual analytics","asynchronous collaboration","insight","multidimensional visualization","","","","","","Visual analytics","Collaboration","Semantics","Correlation","Animation","History","","6102423","978-1-4673-0015-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0015-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0014-8","11EX5936","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102447","23-28 Oct. 2011","6093899","2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2011","IEEE","39","101","Supporting effective common ground construction in Asynchronous Collaborative Visual Analytics"
"To make informed decisions, an expert has to reason with multi-dimensional, heterogeneous data and analysis results of these. Items in such datasets are typically represented by features. However, as argued in cognitive science, features do not yield an optimal space for human reasoning. In fact, humans tend to organize complex information in terms of prototypes or known cases rather than in absolute terms. When confronted with unknown data items, humans assess them in terms of similarity to these prototypical elements. Interestingly, an analogues similarity-to-prototype approach, where prototypes are taken from the data, has been successfully applied in machine learning. Combining such a machine learning approach with human prototypical reasoning in a Visual Analytics context requires to integrate similarity-based classification with interactive visualizations. To that end, the data prototypes should be visually represented to trigger direct associations to cases familiar to the domain experts. In this paper, we propose a set of highly interactive visualizations to explore data and classification results in terms of dissimilarities to visually represented prototypes. We argue that this approach not only supports human reasoning processes, but is also suitable to enhance understanding of heterogeneous data. The proposed framework is applied to a risk assessment case study in Forensic Psychiatry.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102451/","LOCKED","6102451","Intelligent Systems Lab Amsterdam, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37589528300","1","M.A. Migut","37589528300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Expertise Center Forensic Psychiatry, Utrecht, The Netherlands","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37340470100","2","J.C. van Gemert","37340470100","Intelligent Systems Lab Amsterdam, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267865600","3","M.

"In visual analytics, sensemaking is facilitated through interactive visual exploration of data. Throughout this dynamic process, users combine their domain knowledge with the dataset to create insight. Therefore, visual analytic tools exist that aid sensemaking by providing various interaction techniques that focus on allowing users to change the visual representation through adjusting parameters of the underlying statistical model. However, we postulate that the process of sensemaking is not focused on a series of parameter adjustments, but instead, a series of perceived connections and patterns within the data. Thus, how can models for visual analytic tools be designed, so that users can express their reasoning on observations (the data), instead of directly on the model or tunable parameters? Observation level (and thus “observation”) in this paper refers to the data points within a visualization. In this paper, we explore two possible observation-level interactions, namely exploratory and expressive, within the context of three statistical methods, Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA), Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), and Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM). We discuss the importance of these two types of observation level interactions, in terms of how they occur within the sensemaking process. Further, we present use cases for GTM, MDS, and PPCA, illustrating how observation level interaction can be incorporated into visual analytic tools.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102449/","LOCKED","6102449","Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681759500","1","Alex Endert","37681759500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Department of Statistics, Virginia Tech, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38238038000","2","Chao Han","38238038000","Department of Statistics, Virginia Tech, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38232394400","3","Dipayan Maiti","38232394400","Department of Statistics, Virginia Tech, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38241765600","4","Leanna House","38241765600","Department of Statistics, Virginia Tech, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38236156800","5","Scotland Leman","38236156800","Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37419565900","6","Chris North","37419565900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","67","0","23-28 Oct. 2011","Providence, RI, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2011.6102449","130","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102449/","observation-level interaction","visual analytics","statistical models","","","","","","","Data visualization","Data models","Visual analytics","Analytical models","Principal component analysis","Layout","","6102423","978-1-4673-0015-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0015-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0014-8","11EX5936","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102449","23-28 Oct. 2011","6093899","2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2011","IEEE","41","121","Observation-level interaction with statistical models for visual analytics"
"We present a system for the interactive construction and analysis of decision trees that enables domain experts to bring in domain specific knowledge. We identify different user tasks and corresponding requirements, and develop a system incorporating a tight integration of visualization, interaction and algorithmic support.

"Route suggestion is an important feature of GPS navigation systems. Recently, Microsoft T-drive has been enabled to suggest routes chosen by experienced taxi drivers for given source/destination pairs in given time periods, which often take less time than the routes calculated according to distance. However, in real environments, taxi drivers may use different routes to reach the same destination, which we call route diversity. In this paper we first propose a trajectory visualization method that examines the regions where the diversity exists and then develop several novel visualization techniques to display the high dimensional attributes and statistics associated with different routes to help users analyze diversity patterns. Our techniques have been applied to the real trajectory data of thousands of taxis and some interesting findings about route diversity have been obtained. We further demonstrate that our system can be used not only to suggest better routes for drivers but also to analyze traffic bottlenecks for transportation management.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102455/","LOCKED","6102455","The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085959852","1","He Liu","37085959852","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085956285","2","Yuan Gao","37085956285","The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38240091500","3","Lu Lu","38240091500","The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37538552000","4","Siyuan Liu","37538552000","The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","5","Huamin Qu","37272637300","The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273314400","6","Lionel M.

"In modeling infectious diseases, scientists are studying the mechanisms by which diseases spread, predicting the future course of the outbreak, and evaluating strategies applied to control an epidemic. While recent work has focused on accurately modeling disease spread, less work has been performed in developing interactive decision support tools for analyzing the future course of the outbreak and evaluating potential disease mitigation strategies. The absence of such tools makes it difficult for researchers, analysts and public health officials to evaluate response measures within outbreak scenarios. As such, our research focuses on the development of an interactive decision support environment in which users can explore epidemic models and their impact. This environment provides a spatiotemporal view where users can interactively utilize mitigative response measures and observe the impact of their decision over time. Our system also provides users with a linked decision history visualization and navigation tool that support the simultaneous comparison of mortality and infection rates corresponding to different response measures at different points in time.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102457/","LOCKED","6102457","Purdue University Visualization and Analytics Center, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601862300","1","Shehzad Afzal","37601862300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Purdue University Visualization and Analytics Center, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396008400","2","Ross Maciejewski","37396008400","Purdue University Visualization and Analytics Center, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282598900","3","David S.

"Scalable and effective analysis of large text corpora remains a challenging problem as our ability to collect textual data continues to increase at an exponential rate. To help users make sense of large text corpora, we present a novel visual analytics system, Parallel-Topics, which integrates a state-of-the-art probabilistic topic model Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with interactive visualization. To describe a corpus of documents, ParallelTopics first extracts a set of semantically meaningful topics using LDA. Unlike most traditional clustering techniques in which a document is assigned to a specific cluster, the LDA model accounts for different topical aspects of each individual document. This permits effective full text analysis of larger documents that may contain multiple topics. To highlight this property of the model, ParallelTopics utilizes the parallel coordinate metaphor to present the probabilistic distribution of a document across topics. Such representation allows the users to discover single-topic vs. multi-topic documents and the relative importance of each topic to a document of interest. In addition, since most text corpora are inherently temporal, ParallelTopics also depicts the topic evolution over time. We have applied ParallelTopics to exploring and analyzing several text corpora, including the scientific proposals awarded by the National Science Foundation and the publications in the VAST community over the years. To demonstrate the efficacy of ParallelTopics, we conducted several expert evaluations, the results of which are reported in this paper.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102461/","LOCKED","6102461","UNC Charlotte, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606064200","1","Wenwen Dou","37606064200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","UNC Charlotte, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601069300","2","Xiaoyu Wang","37601069300","Tufts University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592409400","3","Remco Chang","37592409400","UNC Charlotte, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300425000","4","William Ribarsky","37300425000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","55","1","23-28 Oct. 2011","Providence, RI, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2011.6102461","240","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102461/","","","","","","","","","","Probabilistic logic","Visualization","Entropy","Analytical models","Text analysis","Semantics","Text processing","6102423","978-1-4673-0015-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0015-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0014-8","11EX5936","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102461","23-28 Oct. 2011","6093899","2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2011","IEEE","45","231","ParallelTopics: A probabilistic approach to exploring document collections"
"Cellular biology deals with studying the behavior of cells. Current time-lapse imaging microscopes help us capture the progress of experiments at intervals that allow for understanding of the dynamic and kinematic behavior of the cells. On the other hand, these devices generate such massive amounts of data (250GB of data per experiment) that manual sieving of data to identify interesting patterns becomes virtually impossible. In this paper we propose an end-to-end system to analyze time-lapse images of the cultures of human neural stem cells (hNSC), that includes an image processing system to analyze the images to extract all the relevant geometric and statistical features within and between images, a database management system to manage and handle queries on the data, a visual analytic system to navigate through the data, and a visual query system to explore different relationships and correlations between the parameters. In each stage of the pipeline we make novel algorithmic and conceptual contributions, and the entire system design is motivated by many different yet unanswered exploratory questions pursued by our neurobiologist collaborators. With a few examples we show how such abstract biological queries can be analyzed and answered by our system.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102459/","LOCKED","6102459","Department of Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38019808500","1","Ishwar Kulkarni","38019808500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Department of Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38232233400","2","Shanaz Y.

"A perennially interesting research topic in the field of visual analytics is how to effectively develop systems that support organizational users' decision-making and reasoning processes. The problem is, however, most domain analytical practices generally vary from organization to organization. This leads to diverse designs of visual analytics systems in incorporating domain analytical processes, making it difficult to generalize the success from one domain to another. Exacerbating this problem is the dearth of general models of analytical workflows available to enable such timely and effective designs. To alleviate these problems, we present a two-stage framework for informing the design of a visual analytics system. This design framework builds upon and extends current practices pertaining to analytical workflow and focuses, in particular, on incorporating both general domain analysis processes as well as individual's analytical activities. We illustrate both stages and their design components through examples, and hope this framework will be useful for designing future visual analytics systems. We validate the soundness of our framework with two visual analytics systems, namely Entity Workspace [8] and PatViz [37].","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102463/","LOCKED","6102463","UNC Charlotte, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601069300","1","Xiaoyu Wang","37601069300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","UNC Charlotte, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606064200","2","Wenwen Dou","37606064200","University of New Hampshire, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591215700","3","Thomas Butkiewicz","37591215700","Palo Alto Research Center, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282252000","4","Eric A.

"Tabular data are pervasive. Although tables often describe multivariate data without explicit network semantics, it may be advantageous to explore the data modeled as a graph or network for analysis. Even when a given table design conveys some static network semantics, analysts may want to look at multiple networks from different perspectives, at different levels of abstraction, and with different edge semantics. We present a system called Ploceus that offers a general approach for performing multi-dimensional and multi-level network-based visual analysis on multivariate tabular data. Powered by an underlying relational algebraic framework, Ploceus supports flexible construction and transformation of networks through a direct manipulation interface, and integrates dynamic network manipulation with visual exploration for a seamless analytic experience.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102440/","LOCKED","6102440","Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592993600","1","Zhicheng Liu","37592993600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284924800","2","Shamkant B.

"While intelligence analysis has been a primary target domain for visual analytics system development, relatively little user and task analysis has been conducted within this area. Our research community's understanding of the work processes and practices of intelligence analysts is not deep enough to adequately address their needs. Without a better understanding of the analysts and their problems, we cannot build visual analytics systems that integrate well with their work processes and truly provide benefit to them. In order to close this knowledge gap, we conducted a longitudinal, observational field study of intelligence analysts in training within the intelligence program at Mercyhurst College. We observed three teams of analysts, each working on an intelligence problem for a ten-week period. Based upon study findings, we describe and characterize processes and methods of intelligence analysis that we observed, make clarifications regarding the processes and practices, and suggest design implications for visual analytics systems for intelligence analysis.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102438/","LOCKED","6102438","Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37673524700","1","Youn-ah Kang","37673524700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267736900","2","John Stasko","37267736900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","37","0","23-28 Oct. 2011","Providence, RI, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2011.6102438","30","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102438/","Intelligence analysis","qualitatvie user study","","","","","","","","Visual analytics","Collaboration","Analytical models","Internet","Information services","Electronic publishing","Artificial intelligence","6102423","978-1-4673-0015-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0015-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0014-8","11EX5936","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102438","23-28 Oct. 2011","6093899","2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2011","IEEE","49","21","Characterizing the intelligence analysis process: Informing visual analytics design through a longitudinal field study"
"There are a growing number of machine learning algorithms which operate on graphs. Example applications for these algorithms include predicting which customers will recommend products to their friends in a viral marketing campaign using a customer network, predicting the topics of publications in a citation network, or predicting the political affiliations of people in a social network. It is important for an analyst to have tools to help compare the output of these machine learning algorithms. In this work, we present G-PARE, a visual analytic tool for comparing two uncertain graphs, where each uncertain graph is produced by a machine learning algorithm which outputs probabilities over node labels. G-PARE provides several different views which allow users to obtain a global overview of the algorithms output, as well as focused views that show subsets of nodes of interest. By providing an adaptive exploration environment, G-PARE guides the users to places in the graph where two algorithms predictions agree and places where they disagree. This enables the user to follow cascades of misclassifications by comparing the algorithms outcome with the ground truth. After describing the features of G-PARE, we illustrate its utility through several use cases based on networks from different domains.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102442/","LOCKED","6102442","Computer Science Department, University of Maryland, College Park, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37714206000","1","Hossam Sharara","37714206000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science Department, University of Maryland, College Park, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546693400","2","Awalin Sopan","37546693400","Computer Science Department, University of Maryland, College Park, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38072149500","3","Galileo Namata","38072149500","Computer Science Department, University of Maryland, College Park, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37829614900","4","Lise Getoor","37829614900","Computer Science Department, Georgetown University, Washington DC, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37691176100","5","Lisa Singh","37691176100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","9","0","23-28 Oct. 2011","Providence, RI, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2011.6102442","70","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102442/","Uncertain Graphs","Comparative Analysis","Model Comparison","Visualizing Uncertainty","","","","","","Predictive models","Data visualization","Uncertainty","Machine learning algorithms","Prediction algorithms","Data models","Visualization","6102423","978-1-4673-0015-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0015-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0014-8","11EX5936","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102442","23-28 Oct. 2011","6093899","2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2011","IEEE","50","61","G-PARE: A visual analytic tool for comparative analysis of uncertain graphs"
"This article describes “Obvious”: a meta-toolkit that abstracts and encapsulates information visualization toolkits implemented in the Java language.

We show several examples on the uses of Obvious, how the different toolkits can be combined, for instance sharing their data models. We also show how Weka and Rapid-Miner, two popular machine-learning toolkits, have been wrapped with Obvious and can be used directly with all the other wrapped toolkits. We expect Obvious to start a co-evolution process: Obvious is meant to evolve when more components of Information Visualization systems will become consensual. It is also designed to help information visualization systems adhere to the best practices to provide a higher level of interoperability and leverage the domain of visual analytics.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102446/","LOCKED","6102446","INRIA, France","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407972900","1","Jean-Daniel Fekete","37407972900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","INRIA, France","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38072289200","2","Pierre-Luc Hémery","38072289200","IBM, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233516200","3","Thomas Baudel","38233516200","City University, London, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399045100","4","Jo Wood","37399045100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7","1","23-28 Oct. 2011","Providence, RI, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2011.6102446","100","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102446/","","","","","","","","","","Data visualization","Data models","Visualization","Observers","Libraries","Java","","6102423","978-1-4673-0015-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0015-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0014-8","11EX5936","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102446","23-28 Oct. 2011","6093899","2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2011","IEEE","51","91","Obvious: A meta-toolkit to encapsulate information visualization toolkits — One toolkit to bind them all"
"Sensitivity analysis is a powerful method for discovering the significant factors that contribute to targets and understanding the interaction between variables in multivariate datasets. A number of sensitivity analysis methods fall into the class of local analysis, in which the sensitivity is defined as the partial derivatives of a target variable with respect to a group of independent variables. Incorporating sensitivity analysis in visual analytic tools is essential for multivariate phenomena analysis. However, most current multivariate visualization techniques do not allow users to explore local patterns individually for understanding the sensitivity from a pointwise view. In this paper, we present a novel pointwise local pattern exploration system for visual sensitivity analysis. Using this system, analysts are able to explore local patterns and the sensitivity at individual data points, which reveals the relationships between a focal point and its neighbors. During exploration, users are able to interactively change the derivative coefficients to perform sensitivity analysis based on different requirements as well as their domain knowledge. Each local pattern is assigned an outlier factor, so that users can quickly identify anomalous local patterns that do not conform with the global pattern. Users can also compare the local pattern with the global pattern both visually and statistically. Finally, the local pattern is integrated into the original attribute space using color mapping and jittering, which reveals the distribution of the partial derivatives.

"We propose a method for the semi-automated refinement of the results of feature subset selection algorithms. Feature subset selection is a preliminary step in data analysis which identifies the most useful subset of features (columns) in a data table. So-called filter techniques use statistical ranking measures for the correlation of features. Usually a measure is applied to all entities (rows) of a data table. However, the differing contributions of subsets of data entities are masked by statistical aggregation. Feature and entity subset selection are, thus, highly interdependent. Due to the difficulty in visualizing a high-dimensional data table, most feature subset selection algorithms are applied as a black box at the outset of an analysis. Our visualization technique, SmartStripes, allows users to step into the feature subset selection process. It enables the investigation of dependencies and interdependencies between different feature and entity subsets. A user may even choose to control the iterations manually, taking into account the ranking measures, the contributions of different entity subsets, as well as the semantics of the features.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102448/","LOCKED","6102448","Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics Research, Darmstadt, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37603783600","1","Thorsten May","37603783600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics Research, Darmstadt, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233628300","2","Andreas Bannach","38233628300","Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics Research, Darmstadt, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37603822500","3","James Davey","37603822500","Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics Research, Darmstadt, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593423500","4","Tobias Ruppert","37593423500","Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics Research, Darmstadt, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37449689200","5","Jörn Kohlhammer","37449689200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","32","2","23-28 Oct. 2011","Providence, RI, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2011.6102448","120","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102448/","","","","","","","","","","Correlation","Data visualization","Algorithm design and analysis","Visualization","Particle measurements","Atmospheric measurements","Sorting","6102423","978-1-4673-0015-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0015-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0014-8","11EX5936","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102448","23-28 Oct. 2011","6093899","2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2011","IEEE","53","111","Guiding feature subset selection with an interactive visualization"
"We propose a visual analytics procedure for analyzing movement data, i.e., recorded tracks of moving objects. It is oriented to a class of problems where it is required to determine significant places on the basis of certain types of events occurring repeatedly in movement data. The procedure consists of four major steps: (1) event extraction from trajectories; (2) event clustering and extraction of relevant places; (3) spatio-temporal aggregation of events or trajectories; (4) analysis of the aggregated data. All steps are scalable with respect to the amount of the data under analysis. We demonstrate the use of the procedure by example of two real-world problems requiring analysis at different spatial scales.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102454/","LOCKED","6102454","Fraunhofer Institute IAIS (Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems) and University of Bonn, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047100","1","Gennady Andrienko","37283047100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Fraunhofer Institute IAIS (Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems) and University of Bonn, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047700","2","Natalia Andrienko","37283047700","DGAC/DTI R&D, ENAC and the University of Toulouse, France","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017336200","3","Christophe Hurter","38017336200","KDDLab, ISTI - CNR, Pisa, Italy","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37670571400","4","Salvatore Rinzivillo","37670571400","Fraunhofer Institute IAIS (Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems) and University of Bonn, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37668062300","5","Stefan Wrobel","37668062300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","58","0","23-28 Oct. 2011","Providence, RI, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2011.6102454","170","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102454/","movement","trajectories","spatio-temporal data","spatial events","spatial clustering","spatio-temporal clustering","","","","Trajectory","Context","Data mining","Visualization","Aggregates","Time series analysis","Clustering algorithms","6102423","978-1-4673-0015-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0015-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-0014-8","11EX5936","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102454","23-28 Oct. 2011","6093899","2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2011","IEEE","54","161","From movement tracks through events to places: Extracting and characterizing significant places from mobility data"
"Geographically-grounded situational awareness (SA) is critical to crisis management and is essential in many other decision making domains that range from infectious disease monitoring, through regional planning, to political campaigning. Social media are becoming an important information input to support situational assessment (to produce awareness) in all domains. Here, we present a geovisual analytics approach to supporting SA for crisis events using one source of social media, Twitter. Specifically, we focus on leveraging explicit and implicit geographic information for tweets, on developing place-time-theme indexing schemes that support overview+detail methods and that scale analytical capabilities to relatively large tweet volumes, and on providing visual interface methods to enable understanding of place, time, and theme components of evolving situations. Our approach is user-centered, using scenario-based design methods that include formal scenarios to guide design and validate implementation as well as a systematic claims analysis to justify design choices and provide a framework for future testing. The work is informed by a structured survey of practitioners and the end product of Phase-I development is demonstrated / validated through implementation in SensePlace2, a map-based, web application initially focused on tweets but extensible to other media.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102456/","LOCKED","6102456","GeoVISTA Center, The Pennsylvania State University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37374699000","1","Alan M.

"In this paper, we present our collaborative work with the U.S. Coast Guard's Ninth District and Atlantic Area Commands where we developed a visual analytics system to analyze historic response operations and assess the potential risks in the maritime environment associated with the hypothetical allocation of Coast Guard resources. The system includes linked views and interactive displays that enable the analysis of trends, patterns and anomalies among the U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue (SAR) operations and their associated sorties. Our system allows users to determine the potential change in risks associated with closing certain stations in terms of response time, potential lives and property lost and provides optimal direction as to the nearest available station. We provide maritime risk assessment tools that allow analysts to explore Coast Guard coverage for SAR operations and identify regions of high risk. The system also enables a thorough assessment of all SAR operations conducted by each Coast Guard station in the Great Lakes region. Our system demonstrates the effectiveness of visual analytics in analyzing risk within the maritime domain and is currently being used by analysts at the Coast Guard Atlantic Area.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102460/","LOCKED","6102460","Purdue University Visualization and Analytics Center (PURVAC), USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37397435000","1","Abish Malik","37397435000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Purdue University Visualization and Analytics Center (PURVAC), USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396008400","2","Ross Maciejewski","37396008400","United States Coast Guard, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233566600","3","Ben Maule","38233566600","Purdue University Visualization and Analytics Center (PURVAC), USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282598900","4","David S.
