After short description of the given data, we elaborate on the constraints for the positioning of a virtual camera in such a way that not only the projected area is maximized, but also the depth of the displayed scene. This is especially important when displaying terrain models, which do not provide good 3D impression when only the projected area is maximized. Based on this concept, we present a method for computing an optimal camera position for each instant of time. Since the explored data are not static, but change depending on the explored scene time, we also discuss a method for animation generation. In order to avoid sudden changes of the camera position, when the previous method is applied for each frame (point in time), we introduce pseudo-events in time, which expand the bounding box defined by the currently active events of interest. In particular, this technique allows events happening in a future point in time to be taken into account such that when this time becomes current, all events of interest are already within the current viewing frustum of the camera.","article_number":"1183826","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1183826","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183826/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183826/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2002.

A special numerical multilevel technique, associated with a particular hierarchical data structure, is so-called adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). It allows one to bridge a wide range of spatial and temporal resolutions and therefore gains increasing popularity. We describe the interplay of several visualization and VR software packages for rendering time dependent AMR simulations of the evolution of the first star in the universe. The work was done in the framework of a television production for Discovery Channel television, \"The Unfolding Universe.\". Parts of the data were taken from one of the most complex AMR simulation ever carried out: It contained up to 27 levels of resolution, requiring modifications to the texture based AMR volume rendering algorithm that was used to depict the density distribution of the gaseous interstellar matter. A voice and gesture controlled CAVE application was utilized to define camera paths following the interesting features deep inside the computational domains. Background images created from cosmological computational data were combined with the final renderings.","article_number":"1183824","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1183824","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183824/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183824/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2002.

Our primary industrial application is the visualization of the vortex rope, a rotating helical structure which builds up in the draft tube of a water turbine. The vortex rope can be characterized by high values of normalized helicity, which is a scalar field derived from the given CFD velocity data. In two related applications, the goal is to visualize the cavitation regions near the runner blades of a Kaplan turbine and a water pump, respectively. Again, the flow structure of interest can be defined by a scalar field, namely by low pressure values. We propose a particle seeding scheme based on quasi-random numbers, which minimizes visual artifacts such as clusters or patterns. By constraining the visualization to a region of interest, occlusion problems are reduced and storage efficiency is gained.","article_number":"1183821","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1183821","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183821/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183821/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2002.

The objective is the development of techniques for a collaborative simulation and visualization shared between structural engineers, seismologists, and computer scientists. The computer graphics research community has been witnessing a large number of exemplary publications addressing the challenges faced while trying to visualize both large-scale surface and volumetric datasets lately. From a visualization perspective, issues like data preprocessing (simplification, sampling, filtering, etc.); rendering algorithms (surface and volume), and interaction paradigms (large-scale, highly interactive, highly immersive, etc.) have been areas of study. In this light, we outline and describe the milestones achieved in a large-scale simulation and visualization project, which opened the scope for combining existing techniques with new methods, especially in those cases where no existing methods were suitable. We elucidate the data simplification and reorganization schemes that we used, and discuss the problems we encountered and the solutions we found. We describe both desktop (high-end local as well as remote) interfaces and immersive visualization systems that we developed to employ interactive surface and volume rendering algorithms. Finally, we describe the results obtained, challenges that still need to be addressed, and ongoing efforts to meet the challenges of large-scale visualization.","article_number":"1183814","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1183814","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183814/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183814/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2002.

Unlike other modeling and scanning techniques the complexity of the object is irrelevant in CT, which naturally enables to model objects with, for example, concavities, holes, twists or fine surface details. Once the data is scanned, one can apply post-processing techniques for data enhancement, modification or presentation. For demonstration purposes we chose to scan a Christmas tree which exhibits high complexity which is difficult or even impossible to handle with other techniques. However, care has to be taken to achieve good scanning results with CT. Further, we illustrate post-processing by means of data segmentation and photorealistic as well as non-photorealistic surface and volume rendering techniques.","article_number":"1183812","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1183812","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183812/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183812/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2002.

The large number of I primitives represented hinders the interactive exploration of the dataset. Though many solutions have been proposed to this problem, many require the creation of isosurfaces at multiple resolutions or the use of additional data structures, often hierarchical, to represent the volume. We propose a technique for adaptive isosurface extraction that is easy to implement and allows the user to decide the degree of adaptivity as well as the choice of isosurface extraction algorithm. Our method optimizes the extraction of the isosurface by warping the volume. In a warped volume, areas of importance (e.g. containing significant details) are inflated while unimportant ones are contracted. Once the volume is warped, any extraction algorithm can be applied. The extracted mesh is subsequently unwarped such that the warped areas are rescaled to their initial proportions. The resulting isosurface is represented by a mesh that is more densely sampled in regions decided as important.","article_number":"1183809","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1183809","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183809/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183809/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2002.

The vertical motion found is typically associated with the variations of the thermocline depth over time, which are mainly a result of the development and movement of ocean fronts, eddies, and internal waves. A new technique, extended from Lagrangian-Eulerian Advection, is presented to help understand the variation of vertical motion associated with the change in thermocline depth over time. A time surface is correctly deformed in a single direction according to the flow. The evolution of the time surface is computed via a mixture of Eulerian and Lagrangian techniques. The dominant horizontal motion is textured onto the surface using texture advection, while both the horizontal and vertical motions are used to displace the surface. The resulting surface is shaded for enhanced contrast. Timings indicate that the overhead over standard 2D texture advection is no more than 12%.","article_number":"1183822","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1183822","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183822/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183822/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2002.

Opal allows intelligent, interactive visualization of a wide variety of different types of data. The PRIMA application is generally applicable to a wide range of patient record data, as the underlying toolkit is flexible with regard to the form of the input data. This application is a good example of the usefulness of information visualization techniques in the bioinformatics domain, as these techniques have been developed specifically to deal with diverse sets of often unfamiliar data. We illustrate several unanticipated findings which resulted from the use of a flexible and interactive information visualization environment.","article_number":"1183817","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1183817","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183817/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183817/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2002.

Appropriate mapping of user goals to the design of pictorial content has been useful in the development of interactive applications with sufficient bandwidth for timely access to the model data. When remote access to the model visualizations is required the limited bandwidth becomes the primary bottleneck. To help address these problems, visualizations are presented on a Web page as a meta-representation of the model output and serve as an index to simplify finding other visualizations of relevance. To provide consistency with extant interactive products and to leverage their cost of development, the aforementioned applications are adapted to automatically populate a Web site with images and interactions for an operational weather forecasting system.","article_number":"1183827","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1183827","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183827/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183827/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2002.

We describe a graphical user interface to set transfer function and viewing/rendering parameters interactively. Experimental results obtained on a general purpose PC equipped with NVIDIA GeForce card are presented to demonstrate that the technique can interactively render AMR data (over 20 frames per second).

It has two main advantages over previous approaches to feature preserving surface smoothing. First is the use of level set surface models, which allows us to process very complex shapes of arbitrary and changing topology. This generality makes it well suited for processing surfaces that are derived directly from measured data. The second advantage is that the proposed method derives from a well-founded formulation, which is a natural generalization of anisotropic diffusion, as used in image processing. This formulation is based on the proposition that the generalization of image filtering entails filtering the normals of the surface, rather than processing the positions of points on a mesh.","article_number":"1183766","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1183766","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183766/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183766/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2002.

Existing algorithms typically rely on a single camera view and degrade in accuracy as the display resolution exceeds the camera resolution by several orders of magnitude. Naive approaches to integrating multiple zoomed camera views fail since small errors in aligning adjacent views propagate quickly over the display surface to create glaring discontinuities. Our algorithm builds and refines a camera homography tree to automatically register any number of uncalibrated camera images; the resulting system is both faster and significantly more accurate than competing approaches, reliably achieving alignment errors of 0.55 pixels on a 24-projector display in under 9 minutes. Detailed experiments compare our system to two recent display wall alignment algorithms, both on our 18 Megapixel display wall and in simulation. These results indicate that our approach achieves sub-pixel accuracy even on displays with hundreds of projectors.","article_number":"1183793","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1183793","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183793/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183793/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2002.

This paper presents a simple and fast method for computing parameterizations with strictly bounded distortion. The new method operates by flattening the mesh onto a region of the 2D plane. To comply with the distortion bound, the mesh is automatically cut and partitioned on-the-fly. The method guarantees avoiding global and local self-intersections, while attempting to minimize the total length of the introduced seams. To our knowledge, this is the first method to compute the mesh partitioning and the parameterization simultaneously and entirely automatically, while providing guaranteed distortion bounds. Our results on a variety of objects demonstrate that the method is fast enough to work with large complex irregular meshes in interactive applications.","article_number":"1183795","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1183795","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183795/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183795/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2002.

Unfortunately, level-of-detail computations can be expensive, creating a bottleneck at the CPU. This paper presents the CABTT algorithm, an extension to existing binary-triangle-tree-based level-of-detail algorithms. Instead of manipulating triangles, the CABTT algorithm instead operates on clusters of geometry called aggregate triangles. This reduces CPU overhead, eliminating a bottleneck common to level-of-detail algorithms. Since aggregate triangles stay fixed over several frames, they may be cached on the video card. This further reduces CPU load and fully utilizes the hardware accelerated rendering pipeline on modern video cards. These improvements result in a fourfold increase in frame rate over ROAM at high detail levels. Our implementation renders an approximation of an 8 million triangle height field at 42 frames per second with an maximum error of 1 pixel on consumer hardware.","article_number":"1183783","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1183783","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183783/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183783/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2002.

We address this problem with a simple and effective method for performing luminance matching on an uncalibrated monitor. The method is akin to the minimally distinct border technique (a previous method of luminance matching used for measuring luminous efficiency), but our method relies on the brain's highly developed ability to distinguish human faces. We present a user study showing that our method produces equivalent results to the minimally distinct border technique, but with significantly improved precision.

Complex polygonal plant models and whole plant populations are represented by relatively small sets of point and line primitives. This enables us to show landscapes faithfully using only a limited percentage of primitives. In addition, a hierarchical data structure allows us to smoothly reduce the geometrical representation to any desired number of primitives. The scene is hierarchically divided into local portions of geometry to achieve large reduction factors for distant regions. Additionally, the data reduction is adapted to the visual importance of geometric objects. This allows us to maintain the visual fidelity of the representation while reducing most of the geometry drastically. With our system, we are able to interactively render very complex landscapes with good visual quality.","article_number":"1183778","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1183778","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183778/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183778/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2002.

We let the polygon information dictate where to apply the parallelogram rule that they use to predict vertex positions. Since polygons tend to be fairly planar and fairly convex, it is beneficial to make predictions within a polygon rather than across polygons. This, for example, avoids poor predictions due to a crease angle between polygons. Up to 90 percent of the vertices can be predicted this way. Our strategy improves geometry compression by 10 to 40 percent depending on (a) how polygonal the mesh is and (b) on the quality (planarity/convexity) of the polygons.","article_number":"1183768","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1183768","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183768/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183768/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2002.

Such texturing is usually implemented via texture mapping, which is easier and more effective when the distortion of the mapping from the surface to the texture map is kept small. We have previously shown that distortion occurs when areas of high surface curvature are flattened into the texture map. By cutting the surface in these areas one can reduce texture map distortion at the expense of additional seam artifacts. This paper describes a faster technique for guiding a texture map seam through high distortion regions, while restricting the seam to regions of low visibility. This results in distortion reducing seams that are less visually distracting and take less time to compute. We have also observed that visibility considerations improve the speed of a recent method that adds cuts to reduce a surface genus.","article_number":"1183787","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1183787","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183787/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183787/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2002.

Taking advantage of the regular structure of grid digital elevation models, efficient hierarchical multiresolution triangulation and adaptive level-of-detail (LOD) rendering algorithms have been developed for interactive terrain visualization. Despite the higher triangle count, these approaches generally outperform mesh simplification methods that produce irregular triangulated network (TIN) based LOD representations. In this project we combine the advantage of a TIN based mesh simplification preprocess with high-performance quadtree based LOD triangulation and rendering at run-time. This approach, called QuadTIN, generates an efficient quadtree triangulation hierarchy over any irregular point set that may originate from irregular terrain sampling or from reducing oversampling in high-resolution grid digital elevation models.","article_number":"1183800","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1183800","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183800/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183800/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2002.

The Contour Tree is a fundamental data structure in scientific visualization that is used to preprocess the domain mesh to allow optimal computation of isosurfaces with minimal overhead storage. The Contour Tree can also be used to build user interfaces reporting the complete topological characterization of a scalar field. The first part of the paper presents a new scheme that augments the Contour Tree with the Betti numbers of each isocontour in linear time. We show how to extend the scheme with the Betti number computation without increasing its complexity. Thus, we improve on the time complexity from our previous approach from O(m log m) to O(n log n+m), where m is the number of tetrahedra and n is the number of vertices in the domain of /spl Fscr/. The second part of the paper introduces a new divide-and-conquer algorithm that computes the Augmented Contour Tree with improved efficiency. The central part of the scheme computes the output Contour Tree by merging two intermediate Contour Trees and is independent of the interpolant. In this way we confine any knowledge regarding a specific interpolant to an oracle that computes the tree for a single cell. We have implemented this oracle for the trilinear interpolant and plan to replace it with higher order interpolants when needed. The complexity of the scheme is O(n+t log n), where t is the number of critical points of /spl Fscr/. For the first time we can compute the Contour Tree in linear time in many practical cases when t=O(n/sup 1-/spl epsi//). Lastly, we report the running times for a parallel implementation of our algorithm, showing good scalability with the number of processors.","article_number":"1183774","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1183774","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183774/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183774/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2002.

Fully automatic procedures seem to be impossible as the notion of \"best\" strongly depends on human judgment as well as on the application. In this paper a solution to the sub-problem of placing light sources for given camera parameters is proposed. A light position is defined to be optimal, when the resulting illumination reveals more about the scene than illuminations from all other light positions, i.e. the light position maximizes information that is added to the image through the illumination. With the help of an experiment with several subjects we could adapt the information measure to the actually perceived information content. We present fast global optimization procedures and solutions for two and more light sources.","article_number":"1183785","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1183785","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183785/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183785/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2002.

In contrast, interactive high quality algorithms are still a challenge nowadays. We introduce here an efficient and accurate technique called object-order ray-casting that can achieve up to 10 fps on current workstations. Like usual ray-casting, colors and opacities are evenly sampled along the ray, but now within a new object-order algorithm. Thus, it allows to combine the main advantages of both worlds in term of speed and quality.

We present an efficient external memory data structure and file format that stores all detail information of the multiresolution triangulation method using significantly less storage then previously reported approaches.

We describe how a simple geometry decimation operation steers a rapid and controlled progressive simplification of tetrahedral meshes, while also taking care of complex mesh-inconsistency problems. The algorithm features a high decimation ratio per step, and inherently discourages any cases of self-intersection of boundary, element-boundary intersection at concave boundary-regions, and negative volume tetrahedra (flipping). We achieved rigorous reduction ratios of up to 98% for meshes consisting of 827,904 elements in less than 2 minutes, progressing through a series of level-of-details (LoDs) of the mesh in a controlled manner. We describe how the approach supports a balanced re-distribution of space between tetrahedral elements, and explain some useful control parameters that make it faster and more intuitive than 'edge collapse'-based decimation methods for volumetric meshes. Finally, we discuss how this approach can be employed for rapid LoD prototyping of large time-varying datasets as an aid to interactive visualization.","article_number":"1183767","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1183767","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183767/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183767/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2002.

In this paper, we define a view-independent visibility measure on mesh surfaces based on the visibility function between the surfaces and a surrounding sphere of cameras.

Many mesh simplification algorithms are based on sequences of edge collapses that minimize geometric and attribute errors. By combining the surface visibility measure with a geometric error measure, we obtain simplified models with improvement proportional to the number of low visibility regions in the original models.","article_number":"1183784","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1183784","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183784/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183784/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2002.

On one hand, traditional geometry-based rendering systems fall short of simulating the visual realism of a complex environment. On the other hand, image-based rendering systems have to date been unable to capture and store a sampled representation of a large environment with complex lighting and visibility effects. In this paper, we present a \"sea of images,\" a practical approach to dense sampling, storage, and reconstruction of the plenoptic function in large, complex indoor environments. We use a motorized cart to capture omnidirectional images every few inches on a eye-height plane throughout an environment. The captured images are compressed and stored in a multiresolution hierarchy suitable for real-time prefetching during an interactive walkthrough. Later, novel images are reconstructed for a simulated observer by resampling nearby captured images. Our system acquires 15,254 images over 1,050 square feet at an average image spacing of 1.5 inches. The average capture and processing time is 7 hours. We demonstrate realistic walkthroughs of real-world environments reproducing specular reflections and occlusion effects while rendering 15-25 frames per second.","article_number":"1183792","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1183792","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183792/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183792/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2002.

In this paper, we present a study of image comparison metrics for quantifying the magnitude of difference between visualization of a computer simulation and a photographic image captured from an experiment. We examined eleven metrics, including three spatial domain, four spatial-frequency domain and four HVS (human-vision system) metrics. Among these metrics, a spatial-frequency domain metric called 2nd-order Fourier comparison was proposed specifically for this work. Our study consisted of two stages: base cases and field trials. The former is a general study on a controlled comparison space using purposely selected data, and the latter involves imagery results from computational fluid dynamics and a rheological experiment. This study has introduced a methodological framework for analyzing image-level methods used in comparative visualization. For the eleven metrics considered, it has offered a set of informative indicators as to the strengths and weaknesses of each metric. In particular, we have identified three image comparison metrics that are effective in separating \"similar\" and \"different\" image groups. Our 2nd-order Fourier comparison metric has compared favorably with others in two of the three tests, and has shown its potential to be used for steering computer simulation quantitatively.","article_number":"1183790","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1183790","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183790/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183790/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2002.

The skeleton is analyzed to create a geometric representation for rendering. Plane-like parts are transformed into an triangulated surface not enclosing a volume by a suitable triangulation scheme. The resulting surfaces have lower triangle count than those created with standard methods and tend to maintain the original geometry, even after simplification with a high decimation rate.

This paper presents a novel visualization technique-kinetic visualization -that uses particle systems to add supplemental motion cues which can aid in the perception of shape and spatial relationships of static objects.

Replacing still images with animations in this fashion, we demonstrate with both surface and volumetric models in the accompanying videos that in many cases the resulting visualizations effectively enhance the perception of three-dimensional shape and structure.

In a typical view-dependent rendering framework, an appropriate level of detail is selected and sent to the graphics hardware for rendering at each frame. In our approach, we have successfully managed to speed up the selection of the level of detail as well as the rendering of the selected levels. We have accelerated the selection of the appropriate level of detail by not scanning active nodes that do not contribute to the incremental update of the selected level of detail. Our idea is based on imposing a spatial subdivision over the view-dependence trees data-structure, which allows spatial tree cells to refine and merge in real-time rendering to comply with the changes in the active nodes list. The rendering of the selected level of detail is accelerated by using vertex arrays. To overcome the dynamic changes in the selected levels of detail we use multiple small vertex arrays whose sizes depend on the memory on the graphics hardware. These multiple vertex arrays are attached to the active cells of the spatial tree and represent the active nodes of these cells. These vertex arrays, which are sent to the graphics hardware at each frame, merge and split with respect to the changes in the cells of the spatial tree.","article_number":"1183760","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1183760","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183760/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183760/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2002.

This non-uniform sampling of an object can miss small or thin structures. One way to address this problem is to scan the same object from multiple directions. In this paper we describe a method for deforming a level set model using velocity information derived from multiple volume datasets with non-uniform resolution in order to produce a single high-resolution 3D model. The method locally approximates the values of the multiple datasets by fitting a distance-weighted polynomial using moving least-squares. The proposed method has several advantageous properties: its computational cost is proportional to the object surface area, it is stable with respect to noise, imperfect registrations and abrupt changes in the data, it provides gain-correction, and it employs a distance-based weighting to ensures that the contributions from each scan are properly merged into the final result. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach on four multi-scan datasets, a Griffin laser scan reconstruction, a CT scan of a teapot and MR scans of a mouse embryo and a zucchini.","article_number":"1183773","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1183773","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183773/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183773/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2002.

This study measured each participant's recall of target identity, order, and location as a measure of cognitive load. Timing information as well as a variety of subjective measures including discomfort and user preference were taken. While the familiar and mature mouse interface scored best by most measures, the speech interface also performed well.

It is shown how to use this framework for a novel exploration of datasets through enhanced transfer function design. Furthermore, our framework is extended to allow real-time re-lighting of the scene created with any rendering method. The technique of post-illumination is introduced to generate new spectral images for arbitrary light colours in real-time. Also a tool is described to design a palette of lights and materials having certain properties such as selective metamerism or colour constancy. Applied to spectral transfer functions, different light colours can accentuate or hide specific qualities of the data. In connection with post-illumination this provides a new degree of freedom for guided exploration of volumetric data, which cannot be achieved using the RGB model.","article_number":"1183763","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1183763","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183763/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183763/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2002.

The size and dimensionality of these datasets make them challenging to display in an effective manner. The images must show the global structure of spatial relationships within the dataset, yet at the same time accurately represent the local detail of each data element being visualized. We propose combining ideas from information and scientific visualization together with a navigation assistant, a software system designed to help users identify and explore areas of interest within their data. The assistant locates data elements of potential importance to the user, clusters them into spatial regions, and builds underlying graph structures to connect the regions and the elements they contain. Graph traversal algorithms, constraint-based viewpoint construction, and intelligent camera planning techniques can then be used to design animated tours of these regions. In this way, the navigation assistant can help users to explore any of the areas of interest within their data. We conclude by demonstrating how our assistant is being used to visualize a multidimensional weather dataset.","article_number":"1183803","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1183803","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183803/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183803/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2002.

This is the data extracted by isosurface algorithms from scalar functions defined on volume grids, and used to generate polygon meshes or alternative representations. In this algorithm the mesh connectivity and a substantial proportion of the geometric information are encoded to a fraction of a bit per marching cubes vertex with a context based arithmetic coder closely related to the JBIG binary image compression standard. The remaining optional geometric information that specifies the location of each marching cubes vertex more precisely along its supporting intersecting grid edge, is efficiently encoded in scan-order with the same mechanism. Vertex normals can optionally be computed as normalized gradient vectors by the encoder and included in the bitstream after quantization and entropy encoding, or computed by the decoder in a postprocessing smoothing step. These choices are determined by trade-offs associated with an in-core vs. out-of-core decoder structure. The main features of our algorithm are its extreme simplicity and high compression rates.","article_number":"1183807","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1183807","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183807/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183807/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization, 2002.

Next, we exploit the object space coherence to quickly detect the remaining pixel depths, by using a precomputed accurate distance field that stores the Euclidean distance from each empty (background) voxel toward its nearest object boundary. In addition, we propose an effective solution to the challenging new-incoming-objects problem during navigation.
