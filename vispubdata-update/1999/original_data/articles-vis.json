However, in turbulent flows standard critical point visualization will result in a cluttered image which is difficult to interpret. This paper presents a technique for collapsing topologies. The governing idea is to classify the importance of the critical points in the topology. By only displaying the more important critical points, a simplified depiction of the topology can be provided. Flow consistency is maintained when collapsing the topology, resulting in a visualization which is consistent with the original topology. We apply the collapsing topology technique to a turbulent flow field.","article_number":"809907","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809907","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809907/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809907/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '99 (Cat.

The focus of this paper is on the interactive visualization of large multivariate data sets based on a number of novel extensions to the parallel coordinates display technique. We develop a multi-resolution view of the data via hierarchical clustering, and use a variation of parallel coordinates to convey aggregation information for the resulting clusters. Users can then navigate the resulting structure until the desired focus region and level of detail is reached, using our suite of navigational and filtering tools. We describe the design and implementation of our hierarchical parallel coordinates system which is based on extending the XmdvTool system.

Existing tracking methods, which consider only the preferred local diffusion direction as they propagate, fail to accurately follow features as they enter regions of local complexity. This shortcoming is a result of partial voluming; that is, voxels in these regions often contain contributions from multiple features. These combined contributions result in ambiguities when deciding local primary feature orientation based solely on the preferred diffusion direction. We introduce a novel feature extraction method which we term tensorline propagation. Our method resolves the above ambiguity by incorporating information about the nearby orientation of the feature, as well as the anisotropic classification of the local tensor. The nearby orientation information is added in the spirit of an advection term in a standard diffusion based propagation technique, and has the effect of stabilizing the tracking. To demonstrate the efficacy of tensorlines, we apply this method to the neuroscience problem of tracking white-matter bundles within the brain.","article_number":"809894","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809894","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809894/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809894/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '99 (Cat.

In addition, our data structure helps to maintain the memory access locality and to provide the sparse data traversal so that our algorithm becomes suitable for large-scale out-of-core applications. Finally, our algorithm allows flexible error control for both the temporal and the spatial coherence so that a trade-off between image quality and rendering speed is possible.

Stanford's \"Interactive Mural\" is an example of such a display, using an overlapping four by two array of projectors that back-project onto a diffuse screen to form a 6' by 2' display area with a resolution of over 60 dpi. Writing software to make effective use of the large display space is a challenge because normal window system interaction metaphors break down. One promising approach is to switch to immersive applications; another approach, the one we are investigating, is to emulate office, conference room or studio environments which use the space to display a collection of visual material to support group activities. We describe a virtual graphics system that is designed to support multiple simultaneous rendering streams from both local and remote sites.

We provide performance measurements to show that the system scales well and thus supports a variety of different hardware configurations.

The application of LIC to 3D flow fields has yet been limited by difficulties to efficiently display and animate the resulting 3D-images. Texture-based volume rendering allows interactive visualization and manipulation of 3D-LIC textures. In order to ensure the comprehensive and convenient exploration of flow fields, we suggest interactive functionality including transfer functions and different clipping mechanisms. Thereby, we efficiently substitute the calculation of LIC based on sparse noise textures and show the convenient visual access of interior structures. Further on, we introduce two approaches for animating static 3D-flow fields without the computational expense and the immense memory requirements for pre-computed 3D-textures and without loss of interactivity. This is achieved by using a single 3D-LIC texture and a set of time surfaces as clipping geometries. In our first approach we use the clipping geometry to pre-compute a special 3D-LIC texture that can be animated by time-dependent color tables. Our second approach uses time volumes to actually clip the 3D-LIC volume interactively during rasterization. Additionally, several examples demonstrate the value of our strategy in practice.","article_number":"809892","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809892","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809892/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809892/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '99 (Cat.

Cloth has very little in-plane deformations, as most of the deformations come from buckling. This can be looked at as area conservation property of cloth. The area conservation formulation of the method modulates the user defined wrinkle pattern, based on deformation of individual triangle. The methodology facilitates use of small in-plane deformation stiffnesses and a coarse mesh for the numerical simulation, this makes cloth simulation fast and robust. Moreover, the ability to design wrinkles (even on generalized deformable models) makes this method versatile for synthetic image generation. The method inspired from cloth wrinkling problem, being geometric in nature, can be extended to other wrinkling phenomena.","article_number":"809885","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809885","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809885/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809885/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '99 (Cat.

However, view-dependent simplification techniques have not been able to take full advantage of the underlying graphics hardware. Specifically, triangle strips are a widely used hardware-supported mechanism to compactly represent and efficiently render static triangle meshes. However, in a view-dependent framework, the triangle mesh connectivity changes at every frame, making it difficult to use triangle strips. We present a novel data structure, Skip Strip, that efficiently maintains triangle strips during such view-dependent changes. A Skip Strip stores the vertex hierarchy nodes in a skip-list-like manner with path compression. We anticipate that Skip Strips will provide a road map to combine rendering acceleration techniques for static datasets, typical of retained-mode graphics applications, with those for dynamic datasets found in immediate-mode applications.","article_number":"809877","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809877","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809877/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809877/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '99 (Cat.

This device effectively places the seismic cube in the user's hand. Geologists who have tried this device have been enthusiastic about the ease of use, and were adept only a few moments after picking it up. We have also developed a multi-modal, visualisation and sonification technique for the dense, multivariate well log data. The visualisation can show two well log variables mapped along the well geometry in a bivariate colour scheme, and another variable on a sliding lens. A sonification probe is attached to the lens so that other variables can be heard. The sonification is based on a Geiger-counter metaphor that is widely understood and which makes it easy to explain. The data is sonified at higher or lower resolutions depending on the speed of the lens. Sweeps can be made at slower rates and over smaller intervals to home in on peaks, boundaries or other features in the full resolution data set.","article_number":"809884","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809884","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809884/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809884/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '99 (Cat.

But the dramatically increasing size of volumetric data sets often prohibits the handling of these models on affordable low-end single processor architectures. Distributed client-server systems integrating high-bandwidth transmission channels and Web based visualization tools are one alternative to attack this particular problem, but therefore new approaches to reduce the load of numerical processing and the number of generated primitives are required. We outline different scenarios for distributed isosurface reconstruction from large scale volumetric data sets. We demonstrate how to directly generate stripped surface representations and we introduce adaptive and hierarchical concepts to minimize the number of vertices that have to be reconstructed, transmitted and rendered. Furthermore, we propose a novel computation scheme, which allows the user to flexibly exploit locally available resources.

The guide's cues may be ignored by continuing in motion, but if the user stops, the gaze shifts automatically toward whatever the guide was interested in. This design has the serendipitous feature that it automatically incorporates a nested collaborative paradigm simply by allowing any given viewer to be seen as the \"guide\" of one or more viewers following behind; the leading automated guide (we tend to select a guide dog for this avatar) can remind the leading live human guide of interesting sites to point out, while each real human collaborator down the chain has some choices about whether to follow the local leader's hints.

The technique provides smooth level-of-detail control and aims at guaranteeing a uniform, bounded frame rate even for widely changing viewing conditions. The optimization algorithm is independent from the particular data structure used to represent multiresolution meshes. The only requirements are the ability to represent a mesh with an arbitrary number of triangles and to traverse a mesh structure at an arbitrary resolution in a short predictable time. A data structure satisfying these criteria is described and experimental results are discussed.","article_number":"809876","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809876","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809876/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809876/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '99 (Cat.

We extend the results of Nielson. First we give two one-parameter families of triangular Haar wavelet bases that are nearly orthogonal in the sense of Nielson.

Its aim is to graphically represent field data in an intuitively understandable and precise way. Here a new approach based on anisotropic nonlinear diffusion is introduced. It enables an easy perception of flow data and serves as an appropriate scale space method for the visualization of complicated flow patterns. The approach is closely related to nonlinear diffusion methods in image analysis where images are smoothed while still retaining and enhancing edges. An initial noisy image is smoothed along streamlines, whereas the image is sharpened in the orthogonal direction. The method is based on a continuous model and requires the solution of a parabolic PDE problem. It is discretized only in the final implementational step. Therefore, many important qualitative aspects can already be discussed on a continuous level. Applications are shown in 2D and 3D and the provisions for flow segmentation are outlined.","article_number":"809904","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809904","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809904/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809904/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '99 (Cat.

Since the method relies on topologically based information, problems such as grid matching and vector alignment which often complicate other comparison techniques are avoided. In addition, since only feature information is used to represent, and is therefore stored for each field, a significant amount of compression occurs.","article_number":"809874","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809874","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809874/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809874/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '99 (Cat.

Prioritized-Layered Projection (PLP) does this by rendering an estimation of the visible set. The novelty in our work lies in the fact that we do not explicitly compute visible sets. Instead, our work is based on computing on demand a priority order for the polygons that maximizes the likelihood of rendering visible polygons before occluded ones for any given scene. Given a fixed budget, e.g. time or number of triangles, our rendering algorithm makes sure to render geometry, respecting the computed priority. There are two main steps to our technique: (1) an occupancy based tessellation of space; and (2) a solidity based traversal algorithm. PLP works by computing an occupancy based tessellation of space, which tends to have smaller cells where there are more geometric primitives, e.g., polygons. In this spatial tessellation, each cell is assigned a solidity value, which is directly proportional to its likelihood of occluding other cells. In its simplest form, a cell's solidity value is directly proportional to the number of polygons contained within it. During our traversal algorithm, cells are marked for projection, and the geometric primitives contained within them actually rendered. The traversal algorithm makes use of the cells' solidity, and other view-dependent information to determine the ordering in which to project cells. By tailoring the traversal algorithm to the occupancy based tessellation, we can achieve very good frame rates with low preprocessing and rendering costs. We describe our technique and its implementation in detail. We also provide experimental evidence of its performance and briefly discuss extensions of our algorithm.","article_number":"809875","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809875","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809875/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809875/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '99 (Cat.

We present Spiraling Edge, a specialized algorithm for surface reconstruction that is three orders of magnitude faster than algorithms for the general case. In addition to sample point locations, our algorithm starts with normal information and knowledge of each point's neighbors. Our algorithm produces a localized approximation to the surface by creating a star-shaped triangulation between a point and a subset of its nearest neighbors. This surface patch is extended by locally triangulating each of the points along the edge of the patch. As each edge point is triangulated, it is removed from the edge and new edge points along the patch's edge are inserted in its place. The updated edge spirals out over the surface until the edge encounters a surface boundary and stops growing in that direction, or until the edge reduces to a small hole that is filled by the final triangle.","article_number":"809903","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809903","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809903/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809903/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '99 (Cat.

These vector fields do exist in real application, as we show by an example of an optical measuring instrument which can gauge the displacement at the surface of a mechanical part. The general idea is to compute LIC textures in the manifold's tangent space and to deform the manifold according to the normal information. The resulting LIC texture is mapped onto the deformed manifold and is rendered as a three dimensional scene. Due to the light's reflection on the deformed manifold, one can interactively explore the result of the deformation.","article_number":"809895","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809895","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809895/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809895/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '99 (Cat.

Our primary application is accelerating terrain rendering. The LOD-sprite technique renders an initial frame using a high-resolution model of the scene geometry. It renders subsequent frames with a much lower-resolution model of the scene geometry and texture-maps each polygon with the image sprite from the initial high-resolution frame. As it renders these subsequent frames, the technique measures the error associated with the divergence of the view position from the position where the initial frame was rendered. Once this error exceeds a user-defined threshold, the technique re-renders the scene from the high-resolution model. We have efficiently implemented the LOD-sprite technique with texture mapping graphics hardware. Although to date we have only applied LOD-sprite to terrain rendering, it could easily be extended to other applications. We feel LOD-sprite holds particular promise for real time rendering systems.","article_number":"809900","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809900","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809900/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809900/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '99 (Cat.

Debugging such systems is difficult using conventional debuggers because the programmer must try to imagine the three-dimensional geometry based on a list of positions and attributes. In addition, the programmer must be able to mentally animate changes in those positions and attributes to grasp dynamic behaviors within the algorithm. We show that representing geometry, attributes, and relationships graphically permits visual pattern recognition skills to be applied to the debugging problem. The particular application is a particle system used for isosurface extraction from volumetric data. Coloring particles based on individual attributes is especially helpful when these colorings are viewed as animations over successive iterations in the program. Although we describe a particular application, the types of tools that we discuss can be applied to a variety of problems.","article_number":"809919","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809919","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809919/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809919/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '99 (Cat.

It processes the source image in a special scanline order instead of the normal raster scanline order. This special scanline has the property of preserving parallelism when projecting to the target image. The algorithm reduces the complexity of perspective-correct image warping by eliminating the division per pixel and replacing it with a division per scanline. The method also corrects the perspective distortion in Gouraud shading with negligible overhead. Furthermore, the special scanline order is suitable for antialiasing using a more accurate antialiasing conic filter, with minimum additional cost. The algorithm is highlighted by incremental calculations and optimized memory bandwidth by reading each source pixel only once, suggesting a potential hardware implementation.","article_number":"809872","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809872","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809872/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809872/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '99 (Cat.

The cracking problem arises in many contexts in scientific visualization and computer graphics modeling where there is need for an approximation based upon domain decomposition that is fine in certain regions and coarse in others. This includes surface rendering approximation of images and multiresolution terrain visualization. In general, algorithms based upon adaptive refinement strategies must deal with this problem. The approach presented here is simple and general. It is based upon the use of a triangular Coons patch. Both the basic idea of using a triangular Coons patch in this context and the particular Coons patch that is used constitute the novel contributions of the paper.","article_number":"809899","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809899","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809899/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809899/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '99 (Cat.

Moreover using interactivity and 3D real time representations, one can easily explore and hence learn quickly in the virtual environments. The concept of virtual and safe laboratories has vast potentials in education. With the aid of computer simulations and 3D visualisations, many dangerous or cumbersome experiments may be implemented in the virtual environments, with rather small effort. Nonetheless visualisation alone is of little use if the respective simulation is not scientifically accurate. Hence a rigorous combination of precise computation as well as sophisticated visualisation, presented through some intuitive user interface is required to realise a virtual laboratory for education. We introduce Delta's Virtual Physics Laboratory, comprising a wide range of applications in the field of physics and astronomy, which can be implemented and used as an interactive learning tool on the World Wide Web.","article_number":"809920","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809920","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809920/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809920/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '99 (Cat.

Previous work has shown that a quadric error metric allows fast and accurate geometric simplification of meshes. This quadric approach was recently generalized to handle meshes with appearance attributes. In this paper we present an improved quadric error metric for simplifying meshes with attributes. The new metric, based on geometric correspondence in 3D, requires less storage, evaluates more quickly, and results in more accurate simplified meshes. Meshes often have attribute discontinuities, such as surface creases and material boundaries, which require multiple attribute vectors per vertex. We show that a wedge-based mesh data structure captures such discontinuities efficiently and permits simultaneous optimization of these multiple attribute vectors. In addition to the new quadric metric, we experiment with two techniques proposed in geometric simplification, memoryless simplification and volume preservation, and show that both of these are beneficial within the quadric framework. The new scheme is demonstrated on a variety of meshes with colors and normals.","article_number":"809869","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809869","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809869/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809869/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '99 (Cat.

The diffusion tensor describes the directional dependence of water molecules' diffusion and can be represented by a three-by-three symmetric matrix. Visualization of second-order tensor fields is difficult because the data values have many degrees of freedom. Existing visualization techniques are best at portraying the tensor's properties over a two-dimensional field, or over a small subset of locations within a three-dimensional field. A means of visualizing the global structure in measured diffusion tensor data is needed. We propose the use of direct volume rendering, with novel approaches for the tensors' coloring, lighting, and opacity assignment. Hue-balls use a two-dimensional colormap on the unit sphere to illustrate the tensor's action as a linear operator. Lit-tensors provide a lighting model for tensors which includes as special cases both lit-lines (from streamline vector visualization) and standard Phong surface lighting. Together with an opacity assignment based on a novel two-dimensional barycentric space of anisotropy, these methods are shown to produce informative renderings of measured diffusion tensor data from the human brain.","article_number":"809886","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809886","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809886/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809886/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '99 (Cat.

An ongoing challenge is to design an efficient data structure that encompasses both compactness of geometric representations and visual quality of progressive representations. We introduce a topological layering based data structure and an encoding scheme to build a compact progressive representation of an arbitrary triangular mesh (a 2D simplicial complex in 3D) with attached attribute data. This compact representation is composed of multiple levels of detail that can be progressively transmitted and displayed. The global topology, which is the number of holes and connected components, can be flexibly changed among successive levels while still achieving guaranteed size of the coarsest level mesh for very complex models. The flexibility in our encoding scheme also allows topology preserving progressivity.","article_number":"809902","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809902","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809902/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809902/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '99 (Cat.

Only voxels that have values inside the iso-range need to be considered, and these voxels can be projected via efficient rasterization schemes. In splatting, each projected voxel is represented as a radially symmetric interpolation kernel, equivalent to a fuzzy ball. Projecting such a basis function leaves a fuzzy impression, called a footprint or splat, on the screen. Splatting traditionally classifies and shades the voxels prior to projection, and thus each voxel footprint is weighted by the assigned voxel color and opacity. Projecting these fuzzy color balls provides a uniform screen image for homogeneous object regions, but leads to a blurry appearance of object edges. The latter is clearly undesirable, especially when the view is zoomed on the object. In this work, we manipulate the rendering pipeline of splatting by performing the classification and shading process after the voxels have been projected onto the screen. In this way volume contributions outside the iso-range never affect the image. Since shading requires gradients, we not only splat the density volume, using regular splats, but we also project the gradient volume, using gradient splats. However alternative to gradient splats, we can also compute the gradients on the projection plane using central differencing. This latter scheme cuts the number of footprint rasterization by a factor of four since only the voxel densities have to be projected.","article_number":"809909","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809909","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809909/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809909/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '99 (Cat.

Even moderately fine tetrahedral meshes consume several mega-bytes of storage. For archivation and transmission compression algorithms are essential. In scientific applications lossless compression schemes are of primary interest. This paper introduces a new lossless compression scheme for the connectivity of tetrahedral meshes. Our technique can handle all tetrahedral meshes in three dimensional euclidean space even with non manifold border. We present compression and decompression algorithms which consume for reasonable meshes linear time in the number of tetrahedra. The connectivity is compressed to less than 2.4 bits per tetrahedron for all measured meshes. Thus a tetrahedral mesh can almost be reduced to the vertex coordinates, which consume in a common representation about one quarter of the total storage space. We complete our work with solutions for the compression of vertex coordinates and additional attributes, which might be attached to the mesh.","article_number":"809868","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809868","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809868/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809868/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '99 (Cat.

The size of data is becoming so large that conventional visualization tools are incapable of processing it, which is in turn is impacting the effectiveness of computational tools. In this paper we describe an object-oriented architecture that addresses this problem by automatically breaking data into pieces, and then processes the data piece-by-piece within a pipeline of filters. The piece size is user specified and can be controlled to eliminate the need for swapping (i.e., relying on virtual memory). In addition, because piece size can be controlled, any size problem can be run on any size computer, at the expense of extra computational time. Furthermore pieces are automatically broken into sub-pieces and each piece assigned to a different thread for parallel processing.

Given that T is 5 to 7 times larger than V and that V often exceeds 32/sup 3/, the storage space required for the connectivity is larger than 300 V bits and thus dominates the overall storage cost. Our \"implants spray\" compression approach introduced in the paper reduces this cost to about 30 V bits or less-a 10:1 compression ratio.

Most efficient polygonal compression methods currently available are restricted to a manifold mesh: they require a conversion process, and fail to retrieve the original model connectivity after decompression. The present method works by converting the original model to a manifold model, encoding the manifold model using an existing mesh compression technique, and clustering, or stitching together during the decompression process vertices that were duplicated earlier to faithfully recover the original connectivity. This paper focuses on efficiently encoding and decoding the stitching information. By separating connectivity from geometry and properties, the method avoids encoding vertices (and properties bound to vertices) multiple times; thus a reduction of the size of the bit-stream of about 10% is obtained compared with encoding the model as a manifold.","article_number":"809870","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809870","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809870/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809870/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '99 (Cat.
