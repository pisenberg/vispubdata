For years researchers have developed many tools to visualize association rules. However, few of these tools can handle more than dozens of rules, and none of them can effectively manage rules with multiple antecedents. Thus, it is extremely difficult to visualize and understand the association information of a large data set even when all the rules are available. This paper presents a novel visualization technique to tackle many of these problems. We apply the technology to a text mining study on large corpora. The results indicate that our design can easily handle hundreds of multiple antecedent association rules in a three-dimensional display with minimum human interaction, low occlusion percentage, and no screen swapping.","article_number":"801866","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=801866","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/801866/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/801866/","publication_title":"Proceedings 1999 IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization (InfoVis'99)","conference_location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","conference_dates":"24-29 Oct. 1999","publication_number":6510,"is_number":17394,"publication_year":1999,"publication_date":"24-29 Oct. 1999","start_page":"120","end_page":"123","citing_paper_count":40,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":874,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Association rules","Text mining","Data visualization","Data mining","Pediatrics","Information analysis","Visual databases","Laboratories","Humans","Data analysis"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-0431-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801865","title":"The automated multidimensional detective","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7695-0431-0","issn":"1522-404X","rank":4,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Tel-Aviv University, Israel","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294162600","id":37294162600,"full_name":"A.

A timeline view of pipeline performance data shows the overall utilization of the pipeline. This information is displayed using multiple time scales, enabling the user to drill down from a high-level application overview to a focus region of hundreds of cycles. This region of interest is displayed in detail using an animated cycle-by-cycle view of the execution. This view shows how instructions are reordered and executed and how functional units are being utilized. Additional context views correlate instuctions in this detailed view with the relevant source code for the application. This allows the user to discover the root cause of the poor pipeline utilization and make changes to the application to improve its performance.

Brushing, a popular method for implementing the selection process, has traditionally been performed in either screen space or data space. We introduce the concept of a structure-based brush, which can be used to perform selection in hierarchically structured data sets. Our structure-based brush allows users to navigate hierarchies by specifying focal extents and level-of-detail on a visual representation of the structure. Proximity-based coloring, which maps similar colors to data that are closely related within the structure, helps convey both structural relationships and anomalies. We describe the design and implementation of our structure-based brushing tool. We also validate its usefulness using two distinct hierarchical visualization techniques, namely hierarchical parallel coordinates and tree-maps.","article_number":"801858","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=801858","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/801858/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/801858/","publication_title":"Proceedings 1999 IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization (InfoVis'99)","conference_location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","conference_dates":"24-29 Oct. 1999","publication_number":6510,"is_number":17394,"publication_year":1999,"publication_date":"24-29 Oct. 1999","start_page":"58","end_page":"64","citing_paper_count":12,"citing_patent_count":9,"download_count":167,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Navigation","Brushes","Displays","Computer science","Information analysis","Data visualization","Data analysis","Tree data structures","Taxonomy"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-0431-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801862","title":"Efficient multi-object dynamic query histograms","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7695-0431-0","issn":"1522-404X","rank":8,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37444609500","id":37444609500,"full_name":"M.

In this way, the system firstly visualizes a spreadsheet on a plane in three-dimensional space, and draws arcs between interrelated cells. By allowing a user to select an arbitrary cell and lift it up with direct manipulation, the system utilizes the third dimension to ameliorate visual occlusion of crossing arcs. As the user lifts a focused cell up, the interrelated cells are lifted up together; thus hidden dataflow networks can be visually intelligible interactively. Because spreadsheets are aimed at calculation itself rather than appearances of outputs, their mechanism is relatively invisible and not obvious for ordinary users. Our visualization helps such users to understand structures and mechanism of spreadsheets.","article_number":"801861","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=801861","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/801861/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/801861/","publication_title":"Proceedings 1999 IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization (InfoVis'99)","conference_location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","conference_dates":"24-29 Oct. 1999","publication_number":6510,"is_number":17394,"publication_year":1999,"publication_date":"24-29 Oct. 1999","start_page":"79","end_page":"82","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":7,"download_count":169,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Application software","Calculators","Debugging","Computer science","User interfaces","Computer languages","Computer graphics","Displays","Layout"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-0431-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801867","title":"A Java-based visual mining infrastructure and applications","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7695-0431-0","issn":"1522-404X","rank":11,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hewlett Packard Research Laboratories, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274264300","id":37274264300,"full_name":"M.C.
