A large number of tweets include opinions about products and services. However, with Twitter being a relatively new phenomenon, these tweets are underutilized as a source for evaluating customer sentiment. To explore high-volume twitter data, we introduce three novel time-based visual sentiment analysis techniques: (1) topic-based sentiment analysis that extracts, maps, and measures customer opinions; (2) stream analysis that identifies interesting tweets based on their density, negativity, and influence characteristics; and (3) pixel cell-based sentiment calendars and high density geo maps that visualize large volumes of data in a single view. We applied these techniques to a variety of twitter data, (e.g., movies, amusement parks, and hotels) to show their distribution and patterns, and to identify influential opinions.","article_number":"6102472","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102472","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102472/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102472/","publication_title":"2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Providence, RI, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2011","publication_number":6093899,"is_number":6102423,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2011","start_page":"277","end_page":"278","citing_paper_count":38,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":3606,"insert_date":"20111215","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Twitter","Data visualization","Calendars","Motion pictures","Data mining","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual Opinion Analysis","Sentiment Analysis","Twitter Analysis","Topic Extraction"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Data Streams","Sentiment Analysis","Sentiment Classification","Twitter Data","Visual Sentiment","Twitter Data Stream","Visual Sentiment Analysis","Visualization Techniques","Wide Range Of Topics","Wide Range Of Subjects","Wide Range Of Themes","Amusement Park","Stream Analysis","Interactive Visualization","Sentiment Values"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0015-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0014-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2011.6102488","title":"ScatterBlogs: Geo-spatial document analysis","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-0015-5","partnum":"11EX5936","rank":2,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems, Universität Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37683989300","id":37683989300,"full_name":"Harald Bosch","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems, Universität Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems, Universität Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233559700","id":38233559700,"full_name":"Dennis Thom","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems, Universität Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems, Universität Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37667957300","id":37667957300,"full_name":"Michael Wörner","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems, Universität Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems, Universität Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593029700","id":37593029700,"full_name":"Steffen Koch","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems, Universität Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems, Universität Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233561200","id":38233561200,"full_name":"Edwin Püttmann","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems, Universität Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems, Universität Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233561600","id":38233561600,"full_name":"Dominik Jäckle","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems, Universität Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems, Universität Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268023800","id":37268023800,"full_name":"Thomas Ertl","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems, Universität Stuttgart, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"We presented Scatterblogs, a system for microblog analysis that seamlessly integrates search backend and visual frontend.

For example, understanding the degree of neuroanatomical similarity between the scanned subjects of a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) repository is a nontrivial task. In this work we present a Coordinated Multiple View (CMV) system for visually analyzing collections of feature-rich datasets. A query-based user interface operates on a feature-respective data scheme, and is geared towards domain experts that are non-specialists in informatics and analytics. We employ multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) to project feature surface representations into three-dimensions, where proximity in location is proportional to the feature similarity. Through query feedback and environment navigation, the user groups clusters that exhibit probable trends across feature and attribute. The system provides supervised classification methods for determining attribute classes within the user selected groups. Finally, using visual or analytical feature-wise exploration the user determines intra-group feature commonality.","article_number":"6102467","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102467","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102467/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102467/","publication_title":"2011

From budgets to organizational charts or even the stock market, trees are everywhere and people find them easy to use. However when analysts need to compare two versions of the same tree structure, or two related taxonomies, the task is not so easy. Much work has been done on this topic, but almost all of it has been restricted to either compare the trees by topology, or by the node attribute values. With this project we are proposing TreeVersity, a framework for comparing tree structures, both by structural changes and by differences in the node attributes. This paper is based on our previous work on comparing traffic agencies using LifeFlow [1, 2] and on a first prototype of TreeVersity.","article_number":"6102471","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102471","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102471/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102471/","publication_title":"2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Providence, RI, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2011","publication_number":6093899,"is_number":6102423,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2011","start_page":"275","end_page":"276","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":387,"insert_date":"20111215","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Vegetation","Data visualization","Visualization","Educational institutions","Image color analysis","Computer science","Topology"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Tree Structure","Topological Differences","Node Attributes","Nodal Properties","Differences In Properties","Stock Market","Amount Of Change","Quantification Of Changes","Negative Changes","Leaf Node","Topological Changes","Tree Level","Treemap","Functional Tree","Performance Of Trees","Node Representations","Node Changes","Changes In Lymph Nodes","Inner Nodes","Interior Nodes","Gas Tank"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0015-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0014-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2011.6102479","title":"KD-photomap: Exploring photographs in space and time","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-0015-5","partnum":"11EX5936","rank":7,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Bonn and Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS), Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233565500","id":38233565500,"full_name":"Iulian Peca","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bonn and Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS), Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Bonn and Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS), Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38242822400","id":38242822400,"full_name":"Haolin Zhi","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bonn and Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS), Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Bonn and Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS), Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37939017400","id":37939017400,"full_name":"Katerina Vrotsou","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bonn and Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS), Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Bonn and Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS), Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047700","id":37283047700,"full_name":"Natalia Andrienko","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bonn and Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS), Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Bonn and Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS), Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047100","id":37283047100,"full_name":"Gennady Andrienko","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bonn and Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS), Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"KD-photomap is a web-based visual analytics system for browsing collections of geotagged Flickr photographs in search of interesting pictures, places, and events.

We have created a system that shows an initial visualization, adapts to user feedback, and produces a distance function as a result. Specifically, we present a multidimensional scaling (MDS) visualization and an iterative feedback mechanism for a user to affect the distance function that informs the visualization without having to adjust the parameters of the visualization directly. An encouraging experimental result suggests that using this tool, data attributes with useless data are given low importance in the distance function.","article_number":"6102478","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102478","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102478/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102478/","publication_title":"2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Providence, RI, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2011","publication_number":6093899,"is_number":6102423,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2011","start_page":"289","end_page":"290","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":127,"insert_date":"20111215","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Vectors","Data models","Computational modeling","Analytical models","Stress","Visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Distance Function","High-dimensional Datasets","Model Parameters","Data Visualization","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Weight Vector","Domain Experts","Low-dimensional Space","Lower-dimensional Space","User Input","Pair Of Classes"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0015-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0014-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2011.6102473","title":"Analysts aren't machines: Inferring frustration through visualization interaction","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-0015-5","partnum":"11EX5936","rank":9,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Science, UNC-Charlotte, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546111900","id":37546111900,"full_name":"Lane Harrison","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science, UNC-Charlotte, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science, UNC-Charlotte, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606064200","id":37606064200,"full_name":"Wenwen Dou","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science, UNC-Charlotte, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science, UNC-Charlotte, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37545504600","id":37545504600,"full_name":"Aidong Lu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science, UNC-Charlotte, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science, UNC-Charlotte, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300425000","id":37300425000,"full_name":"William Ribarsky","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science, UNC-Charlotte, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science, UNC-Charlotte, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601069300","id":37601069300,"full_name":"Xiaoyu Wang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science, UNC-Charlotte, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Recent work in visual analytics has explored the extent to which information regarding analyst action and reasoning can be inferred from interaction. However, these methods typically rely on humans instead of automatic extraction techniques. Furthermore, there is little discussion regarding the role of user frustration when interacting with a visual interface. We demonstrate that automatic extraction of user frustration is possible given action-level visualization interaction logs. An experiment is described which collects data that accurately reflects user emotion transitions and corresponding interaction sequences. This data is then used in building HiddenMarkov Models (HMMs) which statistically connect interaction events with frustration. The capabilities of HMMs in predicting user frustration are tested using standard machine learning evaluation methods. The resulting classifier serves as a suitable predictor of user frustration that performs similarly across different users and datasets.","article_number":"6102473","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102473","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102473/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102473/","publication_title":"2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Providence, RI, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2011","publication_number":6093899,"is_number":6102423,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2011","start_page":"279","end_page":"280","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":229,"insert_date":"20111215","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Hidden Markov models","Humans","Data visualization","Accuracy","Visual analytics","Predictive models","Face"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Hidden Markov Model","Emotional States","Visual System","Interaction Patterns","Predictive Capability","Self-Assessment Manikin","Participants Face","Parallel Coordinates"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0015-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0014-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2011.6102474","title":"Automated measures for interpretable dimensionality reduction for visual classification: A user study","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-0015-5","partnum":"11EX5936","rank":10,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"The Graduate Center, City University of New York, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233506100","id":38233506100,"full_name":"Ilknur Icke","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The Graduate Center, City University of New York, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"The Graduate Center, City University of New York, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37345356700","id":37345356700,"full_name":"Andrew Rosenberg","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The Graduate Center, City University of New York, USA","Queens College, City University of New York, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"This paper studies the interpretability of transformations of labeled higher dimensional data into a 2D representation (scatterplots) for visual classification.1In this context, the term interpretability has two components: the interpretability of the visualization (the image itself) and the interpretability of the visualization axes (the data transformation functions). We define a data transformation function as any linear or non-linear function of the original variables mapping the data into 1D. Even for a small dataset, the space of possible data transformations is beyond the limit of manual exploration, therefore it is important to develop automated techniques that capture both aspects of interpretability so that they can be used to guide the search process without human intervention. The goal of the search process is to find a smaller number of interpretable data transformations for the users to explore. We briefly discuss how we used such automated measures in an evolutionary computing based data dimensionality reduction application for visual analytics. In this paper, we present a two-part user study in which we separately investigated how humans rated the visualizations of labeled data and comprehensibility of mathematical expressions that could be used as data transformation functions. In the first part, we compared human perception with a number of automated measures from the machine learning and visual analytics literature. In the second part, we studied how various structural properties of an expression related to its interpretability.","article_number":"6102474","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102474","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102474/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102474/","publication_title":"2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Providence, RI, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2011","publication_number":6093899,"is_number":6102423,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2011","start_page":"281","end_page":"282","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":8,"download_count":247,"insert_date":"20111215","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Indexes","Humans","Visualization","Data visualization","Support vector machines","Particle measurements","Atmospheric measurements"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["data transformation","visualization","user study"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Dimensionality Reduction","User Study","Linear Function","Linear Map","Visual Analysis","Data Transformation","Original Variables","Transformation Function","Mathematical Transformation","Space Transformation","Aspects Of Interpretation","Linear Model","Linear Regression Model","Linear Discriminant Analysis","Discriminant Function","Discriminant Function Analysis","K-nearest Neighbor","Olive Oil","Class Structure","Block Size","Visual Interpretation","Tree Depth","Linear Projection","View Of Quality"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0015-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0014-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2011.6102476","title":"A state transition approach to understanding users' interactions","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-0015-5","partnum":"11EX5936","rank":11,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of District of Columbia, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37400451800","id":37400451800,"full_name":"Dong Hyun Jeong","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of District of Columbia, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Bowie State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399189900","id":37399189900,"full_name":"Soo-Yeon Ji","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Bowie State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300425000","id":37300425000,"full_name":"William Ribarsky","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Tufts University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592409400","id":37592409400,"full_name":"Remco Chang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tufts University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Understanding users' interactions is considered as one of the important research topics in visual analytics.

They can be seen as a game where one iterates transformation rules on an initial graph, until some condition is met. A rule describes a local pattern (i.e. a subgraph) that must be identified in a graph and specifies how to transform this subgraph. The graph rewriting formalism is at the same time extremely rich and complex, making the study of a model expressed in terms of graph rewriting quite challenging. For instance, predicting whether rules can be applied in any order is often difficult. When modelling complex systems, graphical formalisms have clear advantages: they are more intuitive and make it easier to visualize a system and convey intuitions about it. This work focuses on the design of an interactive visual graph rewriting system which supports graphical manipulations and computation to reason and simulate on a system. PORGY has been designed based on regular exchanges with graph rewriting systems experts and users over the past three years. The design choices relied on a careful methodology inspired from Munzner's nested process model for visualization design and validation [4].","article_number":"6102480","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102480","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102480/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102480/","publication_title":"2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Providence, RI, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2011","publication_number":6093899,"is_number":6102423,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2011","start_page":"293","end_page":"294","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":118,"insert_date":"20111215","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Biological system modeling","Layout","Computational modeling","History","Calculus"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Reasoning","Graph Transformation","Graph Rewriting","Rewrite System","Clear Advantage","Regular Exchange","Chemical Reactions","Biologists","Application Of Rules","Applicable Rules","Dynamic Graph","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Black Edges"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0015-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0014-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2011.6102482","title":"Pexel and heatmap visual analysis of multidimensional gun/homicide data","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-0015-5","partnum":"11EX5936","rank":17,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Statistics, University of Pittsburgh, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37317865100","id":37317865100,"full_name":"Scott D.

Due to their size large high-resolution screens have become popular display devices, especially when used in collaborative data analysis scenarios. However, traditional interaction methods based on combinations of computer mice and keyboards often do not scale to the number of users or the size of the display. Modern smart phones featuring multi-modal input/output and considerable memory offer a way to address these issues. In the last couple of years they have become common everyday life gadgets. In this paper we conduct an extensive user study comparing the experience of test candidates when using traditional input devices and metaphors with the one when using new smart phone based techniques, like multi-modal drag and tilt. Candidates were asked to complete various interaction tasks relevant for most applications on a large, monitor-based, high-resolution tiled wall system. Our study evaluates both user performance and satisfaction, identifying strengths and weaknesses of the researched interaction methods in specific tasks. Results reveal good performance of users in certain tasks when using the new interaction techniques. Even first-time users were able to complete a task faster with the smart phone than with traditional devices.","article_number":"6102466","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102466","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102466/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102466/","publication_title":"2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Providence, RI, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2011","publication_number":6093899,"is_number":6102423,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2011","start_page":"265","end_page":"266","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":280,"insert_date":"20111215","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Smart phones","Mice","Keyboards","Performance evaluation","Stacking","Computers","Three dimensional displays"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Smartphone","Interactive","Large Screening","Computer Mouse","Computer Mice","Traditional Devices","Interaction Techniques","First-time Users","Display Size","User Experience","Small Screen","Input Method","Jigsaw Puzzle"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0015-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0014-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2011.6102468","title":"Reasonable abstractions: Semantics for dynamic data visualization","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-0015-5","partnum":"11EX5936","rank":24,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"College of Technology, Vietnam National University Hanoi, Hanoi, Vietnam","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546825800","id":37546825800,"full_name":"Joseph A.

These semantics are used in the Stencil system to move between data state and data flow execution, build task-based parallelism, and build complex analysis chains for dynamic data. This initial work also shows promise for other complex operators, compilation techniques to enable efficient use of time and space, and mixing task and data parallelism.","article_number":"6102468","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102468","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102468/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102468/","publication_title":"2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Providence, RI, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2011","publication_number":6093899,"is_number":6102423,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2011","start_page":"269","end_page":"270","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":207,"insert_date":"20111215","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Semantics","Rendering (computer graphics)","Data models","Engines","Programming","Dynamic scheduling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Dynamic data","Semantics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Kinetic Data","Dynamic Data","Time And Space","Spacetime","Flow Data","Parallel Data","Data-parallel","Efficient Use Of Time","Changes In Conditions","Changes In Status","Changes In State","Visual System","Interoperability"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0015-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0014-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2011.6102486","title":"Mapping an epidemic outbreak: Effective analysis and presentation","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-0015-5","partnum":"11EX5936","rank":25,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Vision Systems & Technology, Inc., a SAS Company, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38239847300","id":38239847300,"full_name":"Kevin Boone","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Vision Systems & Technology, Inc., a SAS Company, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Vision Systems & Technology, Inc., a SAS Company, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37374975000","id":37374975000,"full_name":"Edward Swing","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Vision Systems & Technology, Inc., a SAS Company, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"The microblog challenge presented an opportunity to use commercial software for visual analysis.

Social media are becoming an important information input to support situational assessment (to produce awareness) in all domains. Here, we present a geovisual analytics approach to supporting SA for crisis events using one source of social media, Twitter. Specifically, we focus on leveraging explicit and implicit geographic information for tweets, on developing place-time-theme indexing schemes that support overview+detail methods and that scale analytical capabilities to relatively large tweet volumes, and on providing visual interface methods to enable understanding of place, time, and theme components of evolving situations. Our approach is user-centered, using scenario-based design methods that include formal scenarios to guide design and validate implementation as well as a systematic claims analysis to justify design choices and provide a framework for future testing. The work is informed by a structured survey of practitioners and the end product of Phase-I development is demonstrated / validated through implementation in SensePlace2, a map-based, web application initially focused on tweets but extensible to other media.","article_number":"6102456","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102456","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102456/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102456/","publication_title":"2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Providence, RI, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2011","publication_number":6093899,"is_number":6102423,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2011","start_page":"181","end_page":"190","citing_paper_count":219,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":3129,"insert_date":"20111215","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Media","Crisis management","Twitter","Visual analytics","Decision making","Organizations"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["social media analytics","scenario-based design","geovisualization","situational awareness","text analytics","crisis management","spatio-temporal analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Situational Awareness","Social Media","Social Platforms","Geographic Information","Effects Of Crisis","Crisis Events","Consequences Of Crisis","Crisis Management","Situation Assessment","Visual Interface","Social Media Sources","Use Of Tools","Seismic","Earthquake","Design Process","Types Of Information","Disaster Management","Disaster Relief","Crisis Response","Emergency Management","Disaster Preparedness","Key Words","Use Of Social Media","Social Media Users","Oil Spill","Oil Pollution","Set Of Techniques","Crisis Situations","Twitter Users","Use Of Twitter","Geolocation Information","Named Entity Recognition","Entity Extraction","Relevant Tweets","Hashtags","Photo-sharing","Image Sharing","Spatial Query","Volunteered Geographic Information","Choropleth Maps","Social Media Tools","Conceptual Framework"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0015-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0014-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2011.6102449","title":"Observation-level interaction with statistical models for visual analytics","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-0015-5","partnum":"11EX5936","rank":32,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681759500","id":37681759500,"full_name":"Alex Endert","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Statistics, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38238038000","id":38238038000,"full_name":"Chao Han","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Statistics, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Statistics, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38232394400","id":38232394400,"full_name":"Dipayan Maiti","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Statistics, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Statistics, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38241765600","id":38241765600,"full_name":"Leanna House","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Statistics, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Statistics, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38236156800","id":38236156800,"full_name":"Scotland Leman","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Statistics, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37419565900","id":37419565900,"full_name":"Chris North","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"In visual analytics, sensemaking is facilitated through interactive visual exploration of data. Throughout this dynamic process, users combine their domain knowledge with the dataset to create insight. Therefore, visual analytic tools exist that aid sensemaking by providing various interaction techniques that focus on allowing users to change the visual representation through adjusting parameters of the underlying statistical model. However, we postulate that the process of sensemaking is not focused on a series of parameter adjustments, but instead, a series of perceived connections and patterns within the data. Thus, how can models for visual analytic tools be designed, so that users can express their reasoning on observations (the data), instead of directly on the model or tunable parameters? Observation level (and thus “observation”) in this paper refers to the data points within a visualization. In this paper, we explore two possible observation-level interactions, namely exploratory and expressive, within the context of three statistical methods, Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA), Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), and Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM). We discuss the importance of these two types of observation level interactions, in terms of how they occur within the sensemaking process. Further, we present use cases for GTM, MDS, and PPCA, illustrating how observation level interaction can be incorporated into visual analytic tools.","article_number":"6102449","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102449","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102449/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102449/","publication_title":"2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Providence, RI, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2011","publication_number":6093899,"is_number":6102423,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2011","start_page":"121","end_page":"130","citing_paper_count":96,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1107,"insert_date":"20111215","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Data models","Visual analytics","Analytical models","Principal component analysis","Layout"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["observation-level interaction","visual analytics","statistical models"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Statistical Models","Visual Analysis","Model Parameters","Interactive Visualization","Sense-making Process","Visual Analytics Tool","Data Structure","Data Visualization","Dimensional Space","Multidimensional Space","Probabilistic Model","Formation Of Interactions","Points In Space","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Latent Space","Embedding Space","Mental Models","Understanding Of The Data","Posterior Mode","Map Estimation","Maximum A Posteriori Estimate","Spatial Interaction","Maximum A Posteriori","Visual Space","Deterministic Methods","Wishart Distribution","Magnification Factor","High-dimensional Datasets","Analytical Reasoning","Self-organizing Map","Kohonen","Information Data","Spatial Metaphors","Number Of Observations","Visual Control"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0015-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0014-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2011.6102453","title":"BaobabView: Interactive construction and analysis of decision trees","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-0015-5","partnum":"11EX5936","rank":33,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Eindhovan University of Technology, Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233594700","id":38233594700,"full_name":"Stef van den Elzen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Eindhovan University of Technology, Netherlands"]}},{"affiliation":"Eindhovan University of Technology, Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267249200","id":37267249200,"full_name":"Jarke J. van Wijk","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Eindhovan University of Technology, Netherlands"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"We present a system for the interactive construction and analysis of decision trees that enables domain experts to bring in domain specific knowledge.

Recently, Microsoft T-drive has been enabled to suggest routes chosen by experienced taxi drivers for given source/destination pairs in given time periods, which often take less time than the routes calculated according to distance. However, in real environments, taxi drivers may use different routes to reach the same destination, which we call route diversity. In this paper we first propose a trajectory visualization method that examines the regions where the diversity exists and then develop several novel visualization techniques to display the high dimensional attributes and statistics associated with different routes to help users analyze diversity patterns. Our techniques have been applied to the real trajectory data of thousands of taxis and some interesting findings about route diversity have been obtained. We further demonstrate that our system can be used not only to suggest better routes for drivers but also to analyze traffic bottlenecks for transportation management.","article_number":"6102455","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102455","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102455/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102455/","publication_title":"2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Providence, RI, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2011","publication_number":6093899,"is_number":6102423,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2011","start_page":"171","end_page":"180","citing_paper_count":82,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1821,"insert_date":"20111215","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Trajectory","Vehicles","Roads","Visualization","Data visualization","Layout","Cities and towns"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Variety Of Routes","Diverse Routes","Visualization Techniques","Trajectory Data","Taxi Drivers","Transportation Management","Thousands Of Data","Time Of Day","Visual System","Low Speed","Geographic Information","Travel Time","Average Speed","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Statistical Information","Traffic Flow","Vehicular Traffic","Traffic Speed","Global View","Traffic Conditions","Traffic State","Diverse Views","Variety Of Views","Center Of The Circle","Road Segments","Street Segments","Diversity Score","Variety Score","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Trip Duration","Number Of Trajectories","Encoding Strategies","Encoding Scheme","Polyline","Road Conditions","Color Bar","Traffic Monitoring"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0015-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0014-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2011.6102461","title":"ParallelTopics: A probabilistic approach to exploring document collections","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-0015-5","partnum":"11EX5936","rank":35,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"UNC-Charlotte, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606064200","id":37606064200,"full_name":"Wenwen Dou","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UNC-Charlotte, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"UNC-Charlotte, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601069300","id":37601069300,"full_name":"Xiaoyu Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UNC-Charlotte, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Tufts University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592409400","id":37592409400,"full_name":"Remco Chang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tufts University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"UNC-Charlotte, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300425000","id":37300425000,"full_name":"William Ribarsky","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UNC-Charlotte, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Scalable and effective analysis of large text corpora remains a challenging problem as our ability to collect textual data continues to increase at an exponential rate. To help users make sense of large text corpora, we present a novel visual analytics system, Parallel-Topics, which integrates a state-of-the-art probabilistic topic model Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with interactive visualization. To describe a corpus of documents, ParallelTopics first extracts a set of semantically meaningful topics using LDA. Unlike most traditional clustering techniques in which a document is assigned to a specific cluster, the LDA model accounts for different topical aspects of each individual document. This permits effective full text analysis of larger documents that may contain multiple topics. To highlight this property of the model, ParallelTopics utilizes the parallel coordinate metaphor to present the probabilistic distribution of a document across topics. Such representation allows the users to discover single-topic vs. multi-topic documents and the relative importance of each topic to a document of interest. In addition, since most text corpora are inherently temporal, ParallelTopics also depicts the topic evolution over time.

While recent work has focused on accurately modeling disease spread, less work has been performed in developing interactive decision support tools for analyzing the future course of the outbreak and evaluating potential disease mitigation strategies. The absence of such tools makes it difficult for researchers, analysts and public health officials to evaluate response measures within outbreak scenarios. As such, our research focuses on the development of an interactive decision support environment in which users can explore epidemic models and their impact. This environment provides a spatiotemporal view where users can interactively utilize mitigative response measures and observe the impact of their decision over time. Our system also provides users with a linked decision history visualization and navigation tool that support the simultaneous comparison of mortality and infection rates corresponding to different response measures at different points in time.","article_number":"6102457","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102457","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102457/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102457/","publication_title":"2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Providence, RI, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2011","publication_number":6093899,"is_number":6102423,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2011","start_page":"191","end_page":"200","citing_paper_count":57,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1374,"insert_date":"20111215","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["History","Analytical models","Diseases","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Adaptation models","Visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Decision Support","Visual Analysis","Epidemic Model","Visual Environment","Disease Transmission","Disease Spread","Visualization Tool","Mitigation Measures","Public Health Officials","Different Points In Time","Future Course","Course Of The Outbreak","Pesticides","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Pandemic Influenza","Flu Pandemic","Consequences Of Decisions","Decisive Effect","Epidemiological Models","Mosquito Populations","Simulation Run","Major Rivers","Epidemic Spread","Simulated Paths","Mitigation Responses","Impact Of Spread","Simulated Day","Rift Valley Fever","Original Path","Original Simulation","Visual Design","Right Click","Left Click","Visual Analytics Tool"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0015-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0014-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2011.6102439","title":"Interactive visual comparison of multiple trees","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-0015-5","partnum":"11EX5936","rank":38,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Interactive-Graphics Systems, TU Darmstadt, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586274500","id":37586274500,"full_name":"Sebastian Bremm","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Interactive-Graphics Systems, TU Darmstadt, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Interactive-Graphics Systems, Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586276100","id":37586276100,"full_name":"Tatiana von Landesberger","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Interactive-Graphics Systems, Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany","Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Interactive-Graphics Systems, TU Darmstadt, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086636530","id":37086636530,"full_name":"Martin Heß","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Interactive-Graphics Systems, TU Darmstadt, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282557600","id":37282557600,"full_name":"Tobias Schreck","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz, Germany","Computational Biology TU Darmstadt, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Interactive-Graphics Systems, TU Darmstadt, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086895876","id":37086895876,"full_name":"Philipp Weil","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Interactive-Graphics Systems, TU Darmstadt, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Computational Biology TU Darmstadt, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086896187","id":37086896187,"full_name":"Kay Hamacherk","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computational Biology TU Darmstadt, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Traditionally, the visual analysis of hierarchies, respectively, trees, is conducted by focusing on one given hierarchy. However, in many research areas multiple, differing hierarchies need to be analyzed simultaneously in a comparative way - in particular to highlight differences between them, which sometimes can be subtle. A prominent example is the analysis of so-called phylogenetic trees in biology, reflecting hierarchical evolutionary relationships among a set of organisms. Typically, the analysis considers multiple phylogenetic trees, either to account for statistical significance or for differences in derivation of such evolutionary hierarchies; for example, based on different input data, such as the 16S ribosomal RNA and protein sequences of highly conserved enzymes. The simultaneous analysis of a collection of such trees leads to more insight into the evolutionary process. We introduce a novel visual analytics approach for the comparison of multiple hierarchies focusing on both global and local structures. A new tree comparison score has been elaborated for the identification of interesting patterns. We developed a set of linked hierarchy views showing the results of automatic tree comparison on various levels of details. This combined approach offers detailed assessment of local and global tree similarities. The approach was developed in close cooperation with experts from the evolutionary biology domain. We apply it to a phylogenetic data set on bacterial ancestry, demonstrating its application benefit.","article_number":"6102439","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102439","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102439/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102439/","publication_title":"2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Providence, RI, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2011","publication_number":6093899,"is_number":6102423,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2011","start_page":"31","end_page":"40","citing_paper_count":55,"citing_patent_count":2,"download_count":1362,"insert_date":"20111215","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Phylogeny","Vegetation","Image color analysis","Data visualization","Organisms"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Comparison","Interactive Visualization","Multiple Trees","Comparison Of Trees","Comparative Tree","Phylogeny","Phylogenetic Tree","Ribosomal Protein","Visual Analysis","Interesting Patterns","Pattern Of Involvement","Visual Approach","Global Similarity","Pairwise Comparisons","High Scores","High Similarity","Biologists","Distribution Of Scores","Detailed Comparison","Structural Comparison","Tree Structure","Tree Nodes","Consensus Tree","Reference Tree","Tree Visualization","Leaf Node","Detailed View","Subtree","Position Weight Matrices","Position-specific Scoring Matrix","Score Matrix","Position Weight Matrix","Similar Tree","Interesting Part","Color Map","Projects Dealing","Project Dealt"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0015-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0014-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2011.6102438","title":"Characterizing the intelligence analysis process: Informing visual analytics design through a longitudinal field study","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-0015-5","partnum":"11EX5936","rank":39,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37673524700","id":37673524700,"full_name":"Youn-ah Kang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267736900","id":37267736900,"full_name":"John Stasko","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"While intelligence analysis has been a primary target domain for visual analytics system development, relatively little user and task analysis has been conducted within this area. Our research community's understanding of the work processes and practices of intelligence analysts is not deep enough to adequately address their needs. Without a better understanding of the analysts and their problems, we cannot build visual analytics systems that integrate well with their work processes and truly provide benefit to them. In order to close this knowledge gap, we conducted a longitudinal, observational field study of intelligence analysts in training within the intelligence program at Mercyhurst College. We observed three teams of analysts, each working on an intelligence problem for a ten-week period. Based upon study findings, we describe and characterize processes and methods of intelligence analysis that we observed, make clarifications regarding the processes and practices, and suggest design implications for visual analytics systems for intelligence analysis.","article_number":"6102438","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102438","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102438/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102438/","publication_title":"2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Providence, RI, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2011","publication_number":6093899,"is_number":6102423,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2011","start_page":"21","end_page":"30","citing_paper_count":51,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1007,"insert_date":"20111215","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Collaboration","Analytical models","Internet","Information services","Electronic publishing","Artificial intelligence"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Intelligence analysis","qualitatvie user study"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Intelligence Analysis","Intelligence Analysis Process","Observational Studies","Population-based Study","Visual System","Implications For Systems","Intelligence Analysts","Intelligence Programs","Analytical Methods","Conceptual Model","Collection Process","Teamwork","Analytical Tools","Part Of Analysis","Undergraduate Education","Undergraduate Teaching","Social Network Analysis","Push And Pull","End Of The Project","Sanity Check","Student Teams","Type Of Collaboration","Intelligent Processing","Visual Analytics Tool","Wiki Page","Middle Of Process","Strategic Projects","National Intelligence","Confidence Analysis","Team Members","Stages Of Process"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0015-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0014-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2011.6102448","title":"Guiding feature subset selection with an interactive visualization","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-0015-5","partnum":"11EX5936","rank":40,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer Institute of Computer Graphics Research (IGD), Darmstadt, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37603783600","id":37603783600,"full_name":"Thorsten May","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute of Computer Graphics Research (IGD), Darmstadt, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer Institute of Computer Graphics Research (IGD), Darmstadt, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233628300","id":38233628300,"full_name":"Andreas Bannach","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute of Computer Graphics Research (IGD), Darmstadt, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer Institute of Computer Graphics Research (IGD), Darmstadt, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37603822500","id":37603822500,"full_name":"James Davey","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute of Computer Graphics Research (IGD), Darmstadt, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer Institute of Computer Graphics Research (IGD), Darmstadt, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593423500","id":37593423500,"full_name":"Tobias Ruppert","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute of Computer Graphics Research (IGD), Darmstadt, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer Institute of Computer Graphics Research (IGD), Darmstadt, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37449689200","id":37449689200,"full_name":"Jörn Kohlhammer","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute of Computer Graphics Research (IGD), Darmstadt, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"We propose a method for the semi-automated refinement of the results of feature subset selection algorithms. Feature subset selection is a preliminary step in data analysis which identifies the most useful subset of features (columns) in a data table. So-called filter techniques use statistical ranking measures for the correlation of features. Usually a measure is applied to all entities (rows) of a data table. However, the differing contributions of subsets of data entities are masked by statistical aggregation. Feature and entity subset selection are, thus, highly interdependent. Due to the difficulty in visualizing a high-dimensional data table, most feature subset selection algorithms are applied as a black box at the outset of an analysis. Our visualization technique, SmartStripes, allows users to step into the feature subset selection process. It enables the investigation of dependencies and interdependencies between different feature and entity subsets. A user may even choose to control the iterations manually, taking into account the ranking measures, the contributions of different entity subsets, as well as the semantics of the features.","article_number":"6102448","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102448","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102448/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102448/","publication_title":"2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Providence, RI, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2011","publication_number":6093899,"is_number":6102423,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2011","start_page":"111","end_page":"120","citing_paper_count":50,"citing_patent_count":3,"download_count":1433,"insert_date":"20111215","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Correlation","Data visualization","Algorithm design and analysis","Visualization","Particle measurements","Atmospheric measurements","Sorting"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive","Feature Subset","Interdependence","Statistical Measures","Semantic Features","Visualization Techniques","Heuristic","Rule Of Thumb","Correlation Matrix","Correlation Matrices","Quality Measures","Distribution Of Values","Feature Values","Characteristic Values","Subset Of Data","Chemical Components","Empirical Formula","Automatic Method","Correlation Measures","Filtering Method","Quality Metrics","Target Features","Target Characteristics","Advanced Strategies","Advanced Schemes","Advantageous Strategy","Numerous Features","Numerous Characteristics","Candidate Features","Characterization Of Candidates","Scatterplot Matrix","Scatterplot Matrices","Local Dependence","Detailed Inspection","Filtering Algorithm","Feature Selection Methods","Scrolling","Dimensionality Reduction Methods","Discretion","Feature Classification","Categorical Features"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0015-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0014-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2011.6102445","title":"How locus of control influences compatibility with visualization style","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-0015-5","partnum":"11EX5936","rank":41,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Brown University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37548028800","id":37548028800,"full_name":"Caroline Ziemkiewicz","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Brown University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Tufts University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38229914800","id":38229914800,"full_name":"R.

In this paper, we extend this research by isolating factors in personality traits as well as in the visualizations that could have contributed to the observed correlation. We focus on a personality trait known as “locus of control,” which represents a person's tendency to see themselves as controlled by or in control of external events. To isolate variables of the visualization design, we control extraneous factors such as color, interaction, and labeling, and specifically focus on the overall layout style of the visualizations. We conduct a user study with four visualizations that gradually shift from an indentation metaphor to a containment metaphor and compare the participants' speed, accuracy, and preference with their locus of control. Our findings demonstrate that there is indeed a correlation between the two: participants with an internal locus of control perform more poorly with visualizations that employ a containment metaphor, while those with an external locus of control perform well with such visualizations. We discuss a possible explanation for this relationship based in cognitive psychology and propose that these results can be used to better understand how people use visualizations and how to adapt visual analytics design to an individual user's needs.","article_number":"6102445","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102445","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102445/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102445/","publication_title":"2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Providence, RI, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2011","publication_number":6093899,"is_number":6102423,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2011","start_page":"81","end_page":"90","citing_paper_count":40,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":491,"insert_date":"20111215","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Layout","Data visualization","Visual analytics","Particle measurements","Encoding","Correlation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Locus Of Control","Sense Of Control","Visual Style","Individual Differences","Personality Traits","Visual System","User Study","Visual Analysis","Control Events","Personal Dispositions","Personality Tendencies","Personal Inclinations","Visual Design","Internal Locus Of Control","External Locus Of Control","Types Of Questions","Design Elements","Mechanical Turk","Mental Models","Real-world Systems","Spatial Ability","Search Task","Big Five Personality","External Representations","Interaction Styles","Personal Style","Visual Encoding","Inference Task","Nest Boxes","Explicit Structure","Visual Metaphors","Visual Interface","Pre-attentive Processing"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0015-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0014-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2011.6102437","title":"Perception-based visual quality measures","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-0015-5","partnum":"11EX5936","rank":42,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37603943800","id":37603943800,"full_name":"Georgia Albuquerque","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546817000","id":37546817000,"full_name":"Martin Eisemann","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273816400","id":37273816400,"full_name":"Marcus Magnor","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"In recent years diverse quality measures to support the exploration of high-dimensional data sets have been proposed. Such measures can be very useful to rank and select information-bearing projections of very high dimensional data, when the visual exploration of all possible projections becomes unfeasible. But even though a ranking of the low dimensional projections may support the user in the visual exploration task, different measures deliver different distances between the views that do not necessarily match the expectations of human perception. As an alternative solution, we propose a perception-based approach that, similar to the existing measures, can be used to select information bearing projections of the data. Specifically, we construct a perceptual embedding for the different projections based on the data from a psychophysics study and multi-dimensional scaling. This embedding together with a ranking function is then used to estimate the value of the projections for a specific user task in a perceptual sense.","article_number":"6102437","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102437","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102437/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102437/","publication_title":"2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Providence, RI, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2011","publication_number":6093899,"is_number":6102423,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2011","start_page":"13","end_page":"20","citing_paper_count":39,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":638,"insert_date":"20111215","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Correlation","Visualization","Training","Data visualization","Humans","Atmospheric measurements","Particle measurements"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Quality Measures","Visual Quality","Specific Tasks","Project Data","High-dimensional Datasets","Visual Exploration","Psychophysical Studies","Ranking Function","User Tasks","Exploration Task","Exploration Of Datasets","Low-dimensional Projection","Lower-dimensional Projection","Pairwise Comparisons","Training Set","Linear Correlation","Linear Correlation Coefficient","Simple Correlation","User Study","Visual Analysis","Good Value","Variety Of Tasks","Visual Methods","Vertical Separation","Mutual Distance","Class Separation","Nonlinear Correlation","Parallel Coordinates","Human Visual System","Distance Perception","Perception Of Space","Quality Value","Similar Plots"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0015-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0014-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2011.6102440","title":"Network-based visual analysis of tabular data","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-0015-5","partnum":"11EX5936","rank":43,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592993600","id":37592993600,"full_name":"Zhicheng Liu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284924800","id":37284924800,"full_name":"Shamkant B.

Although tables often describe multivariate data without explicit network semantics, it may be advantageous to explore the data modeled as a graph or network for analysis. Even when a given table design conveys some static network semantics, analysts may want to look at multiple networks from different perspectives, at different levels of abstraction, and with different edge semantics. We present a system called Ploceus that offers a general approach for performing multi-dimensional and multi-level network-based visual analysis on multivariate tabular data. Powered by an underlying relational algebraic framework, Ploceus supports flexible construction and transformation of networks through a direct manipulation interface, and integrates dynamic network manipulation with visual exploration for a seamless analytic experience.","article_number":"6102440","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102440","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102440/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102440/","publication_title":"2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Providence, RI, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2011","publication_number":6093899,"is_number":6102423,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2011","start_page":"41","end_page":"50","citing_paper_count":33,"citing_patent_count":2,"download_count":805,"insert_date":"20111215","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Semantics","Visualization","Data visualization","Organizations","Cities and towns","Relational databases","Aggregates"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis Of Data","Network Construction","Multivariate Data","Multivariate Statistics","Direct Use","Direct Utilization","Direct Manipulation","Level Of Abstraction","Static Network","Visual Exploration","Different Levels Of Abstraction","Direct Interface","Management Programs","Program Directors","Grant Number","Visual Network","Network Diagram","Edge Weights","Type Of Operation","National Science Foundation","Set Of Operations","Betweenness Centrality","Row Of Table","Relational Database","Related Queries","Formal Framework","Information Framework","Types Of Nodes","High-level Tasks","Higher-level Tasks","University Of Colorado Boulder","CU Boulder","University Of Colorado At Boulder","Large Grants","Node Labels","Small Grants","Transformation Operations","Aggregator Node","Right Click","Left Click","Number Of Systems"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0015-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0014-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2011.6102458","title":"SAVE: Sensor anomaly visualization engine","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-0015-5","partnum":"11EX5936","rank":44,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"IBM Research, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085394737","id":37085394737,"full_name":"Lei Shi","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IBM Research, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science and Engineering Department, University of Notre Dame, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37075401000","id":37075401000,"full_name":"Qi Liao","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, University of Notre Dame, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science and Engineering Department, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37398853200","id":37398853200,"full_name":"Yuan He","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science and Technology Department, Xi'an Jiaotong University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085434077","id":37085434077,"full_name":"Rui Li","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science and Technology Department, Xi'an Jiaotong University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science and Engineering Department, University of Notre Dame, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37298955400","id":37298955400,"full_name":"Aaron Striegel","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, University of Notre Dame, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"IBM Research, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37588016000","id":37588016000,"full_name":"Zhong Su","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IBM Research, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Diagnosing a large-scale sensor network is a crucial but challenging task.

A number of sensitivity analysis methods fall into the class of local analysis, in which the sensitivity is defined as the partial derivatives of a target variable with respect to a group of independent variables. Incorporating sensitivity analysis in visual analytic tools is essential for multivariate phenomena analysis. However, most current multivariate visualization techniques do not allow users to explore local patterns individually for understanding the sensitivity from a pointwise view. In this paper, we present a novel pointwise local pattern exploration system for visual sensitivity analysis. Using this system, analysts are able to explore local patterns and the sensitivity at individual data points, which reveals the relationships between a focal point and its neighbors. During exploration, users are able to interactively change the derivative coefficients to perform sensitivity analysis based on different requirements as well as their domain knowledge. Each local pattern is assigned an outlier factor, so that users can quickly identify anomalous local patterns that do not conform with the global pattern. Users can also compare the local pattern with the global pattern both visually and statistically. Finally, the local pattern is integrated into the original attribute space using color mapping and jittering, which reveals the distribution of the partial derivatives. Case studies with real datasets are used to investigate the effectiveness of the visualizations and interactions.","article_number":"6102450","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102450","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102450/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102450/","publication_title":"2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Providence, RI, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2011","publication_number":6093899,"is_number":6102423,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2011","start_page":"131","end_page":"140","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":332,"insert_date":"20111215","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Sensitivity analysis","Vectors","Image color analysis","Analytical models","Data mining","Visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Knowledge Discovery","sensitivity analysis","local pattern visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Sensitivity Analysis","Local Patterns","Multivariate Analysis","Multivariate Analysis Of Variance","Partial Differential","Partial Derivatives","Local Analysis","Global Patterns","Target Variable","Color Map","Performed Sensitivity Analyses","Visualization Techniques","Individual Data Points","Anomalous Patterns","Model Selection","Model Construction","Target Value","Apartment","Multivariate Data","Multivariate Statistics","Global View","Original Space","Local Trends","Red Diamonds","Local View","Parallel Coordinates","Categorical Attributes","Classification Properties","Attribute Classification","High Clarity","Neighboring Values","Values In The Neighborhood","Interactive Exploration","Bar Height","Height Of Each Bar","Blue Points"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0015-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0014-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2011.6102441","title":"Orion: A system for modeling, transformation and visualization of multidimensional heterogeneous networks","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-0015-5","partnum":"11EX5936","rank":49,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Stanford, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550791300","id":37550791300,"full_name":"Jeffrey Heer","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stanford, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"IBM Research, India","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294938400","id":37294938400,"full_name":"Adam Perer","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IBM Research, India"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"The study of complex activities such as scientific production and software development often require modeling connections among heterogeneous entities including people, institutions and artifacts.

In this paper we present Orion, a system for interactive modeling, transformation and visualization of network data. Orion's interface enables the rapid manipulation of large graphs-including the specification of complex linking relationships-using simple drag-and-drop operations with desired node types. Orion maps these user interactions to statements in a declarative workflow language that incorporates both relational operators (e.g., selection, aggregation and joins) and network analytics (e.g., centrality measures). We demonstrate how these features enable analysts to flexibly construct and compare networks in domains such as online health communities, academic collaboration and distributed software development.","article_number":"6102441","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102441","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102441/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102441/","publication_title":"2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Providence, RI, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2011","publication_number":6093899,"is_number":6102423,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2011","start_page":"51","end_page":"60","citing_paper_count":14,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":504,"insert_date":"20111215","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Joining processes","Data models","Data visualization","Communities","Analytical models","Social network services"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["social network analysis","data management","data transformation","graphs","visualization","end-user programming"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Model System","Network Model","Transformation System","Social Networks","Network Analysis","Data Model","Visualization Techniques","Interactive Visualization","Types Of Nodes","Online Health","Academic Collaboration","Interactive Data Visualization","Online Health Communities","Edge Weights","Graph Data","Betweenness Centrality","Social Network Analysis","Lyme Disease","Lyme Borreliosis","Source Node","Target Node","Source Field","Network Extracts","Bigraph","Link Graph","Key Reference","Definition Of Network","Van Ham","Node Attributes","Nodal Properties","Aggregation Network","Right Click","Left Click","Graph Metrics","Graph Distance"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0015-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0014-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2011.6102447","title":"Supporting effective common ground construction in Asynchronous Collaborative Visual Analytics","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-0015-5","partnum":"11EX5936","rank":50,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37600587200","id":37600587200,"full_name":"Yang Chen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Kent University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37846905500","id":37846905500,"full_name":"Jamal Alsakran","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Kent University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591128900","id":37591128900,"full_name":"Scott Barlowe","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37292632600","id":37292632600,"full_name":"Jing Yang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Kent State Univer, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37277701200","id":37277701200,"full_name":"Ye Zhao","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Kent State Univer, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Asynchronous Collaborative Visual Analytics (ACVA) leverages group sensemaking by releasing the constraints on when, where, and who works collaboratively.

This is challenging due to the lack of instant communication and scale of collaboration in ACVA. We propose a novel visual analytics approach that automatically gathers, organizes, and summarizes insights to form common ground with reduced human effort. The rich set of visualization and interaction techniques provided in our approach allows users to effectively and flexibly control the common ground construction and review, explore, and compare insights in detail.

Items in such datasets are typically represented by features. However, as argued in cognitive science, features do not yield an optimal space for human reasoning. In fact, humans tend to organize complex information in terms of prototypes or known cases rather than in absolute terms. When confronted with unknown data items, humans assess them in terms of similarity to these prototypical elements. Interestingly, an analogues similarity-to-prototype approach, where prototypes are taken from the data, has been successfully applied in machine learning. Combining such a machine learning approach with human prototypical reasoning in a Visual Analytics context requires to integrate similarity-based classification with interactive visualizations. To that end, the data prototypes should be visually represented to trigger direct associations to cases familiar to the domain experts. In this paper, we propose a set of highly interactive visualizations to explore data and classification results in terms of dissimilarities to visually represented prototypes. We argue that this approach not only supports human reasoning processes, but is also suitable to enhance understanding of heterogeneous data. The proposed framework is applied to a risk assessment case study in Forensic Psychiatry.","article_number":"6102451","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102451","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102451/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102451/","publication_title":"2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Providence, RI, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2011","publication_number":6093899,"is_number":6102423,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2011","start_page":"141","end_page":"149","citing_paper_count":11,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":406,"insert_date":"20111215","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Prototypes","Data visualization","Humans","Data mining","Visual analytics","Image color analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["dissimilarity based classification","dissimilarity based visualization","prototypes","interactive visualization","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Classification Results","Visual Analysis","Domain Experts","Interactive Visualization","Human Reasoning","Forensic Psychiatry","Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve","ROC Curve","Data Visualization","Data Elements","Nominal Value","Values Of Items","Linear Classifier","Decision Boundary","Contribution Of Features","Contribution Of Characteristics","Contribution Of Each Feature","Recidivism","Reoffending","Scattering Matrix","Scattering Matrices","S-matrix","Visual Components","Radar Chart","Radar Graph","Item Descriptions","Description Of Each Item","Interactive Framework","Items Of Interest","Aspects Of Space","Forensic Applications","Forensic Experts","Uniform Representation","Projection Plot","Related Elements","Visual Representation","Good Classification","Interaction Design"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0015-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0014-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2011.6102442","title":"G-PARE: A visual analytic tool for comparative analysis of uncertain graphs","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-0015-5","partnum":"11EX5936","rank":52,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, University of Maryland, College Park, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37714206000","id":37714206000,"full_name":"Hossam Sharara","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Maryland, College Park, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, University of Maryland, College Park, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546693400","id":37546693400,"full_name":"Awalin Sopan","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Maryland, College Park, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, University of Maryland, College Park, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38072149500","id":38072149500,"full_name":"Galileo Namata","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Maryland, College Park, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, University of Maryland, College Park, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37829614900","id":37829614900,"full_name":"Lise Getoor","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Maryland, College Park, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, George town University, Washington DC, DC, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37691176100","id":37691176100,"full_name":"Lisa Singh","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, George town University, Washington DC, DC, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"There are a growing number of machine learning algorithms which operate on graphs. Example applications for these algorithms include predicting which customers will recommend products to their friends in a viral marketing campaign using a customer network, predicting the topics of publications in a citation network, or predicting the political affiliations of people in a social network. It is important for an analyst to have tools to help compare the output of these machine learning algorithms. In this work, we present G-PARE, a visual analytic tool for comparing two uncertain graphs, where each uncertain graph is produced by a machine learning algorithm which outputs probabilities over node labels. G-PARE provides several different views which allow users to obtain a global overview of the algorithms output, as well as focused views that show subsets of nodes of interest. By providing an adaptive exploration environment, G-PARE guides the users to places in the graph where two algorithms predictions agree and places where they disagree. This enables the user to follow cascades of misclassifications by comparing the algorithms outcome with the ground truth. After describing the features of G-PARE, we illustrate its utility through several use cases based on networks from different domains.","article_number":"6102442","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102442","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102442/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102442/","publication_title":"2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Providence, RI, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2011","publication_number":6093899,"is_number":6102423,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2011","start_page":"61","end_page":"70","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":415,"insert_date":"20111215","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Predictive models","Data visualization","Uncertainty","Machine learning algorithms","Prediction algorithms","Data models","Visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Uncertain Graphs","Comparative Analysis","Model Comparison","Visualizing Uncertainty"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Visual Analytics Tool","Machine Learning","Learning Algorithms","Machine Learning Algorithms","Output Of Algorithm","Subset Of Nodes","Node Labels","Citation Network","Node Of Interest","Viral Marketing","Viral Advertising","Viral Ads","Divergence","Neural Network","Support Vector Machine","Confusion Matrix","Confusion Matrices","Email Address","Cell Matrix","Visual Network","Network Diagram","Data Transformation","Correct Predictions","Nodes In The Graph","Network View","Word Usage","Probabilistic Method","Bottlenose Dolphins","Tursiops","Top Nodes","Parallel Coordinates","Ego Network","Incorrect Predictions","Traditional Work","Vertical Bars","Vertical Pipe","Vert"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0015-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0014-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2011.6102462","title":"Analysis of large digital collections with interactive visualization","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-0015-5","partnum":"11EX5936","rank":53,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Texas, Austin, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37833781800","id":37833781800,"full_name":"Weijia Xu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Texas, Austin, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Texas, Austin, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38031284100","id":38031284100,"full_name":"Maria Esteva","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Texas, Austin, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Texas, Austin, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38236520200","id":38236520200,"full_name":"Suyog Dutt Jain","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Texas, Austin, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Texas, Austin, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38238537900","id":38238537900,"full_name":"Varun Jain","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Texas, Austin, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"To make decisions about the long-term preservation and access of large digital collections, archivists gather information such as the collections' contents, their organizational structure, and their file format composition.

The problem is, however, most domain analytical practices generally vary from organization to organization. This leads to diverse designs of visual analytics systems in incorporating domain analytical processes, making it difficult to generalize the success from one domain to another. Exacerbating this problem is the dearth of general models of analytical workflows available to enable such timely and effective designs. To alleviate these problems, we present a two-stage framework for informing the design of a visual analytics system. This design framework builds upon and extends current practices pertaining to analytical workflow and focuses, in particular, on incorporating both general domain analysis processes as well as individual's analytical activities. We illustrate both stages and their design components through examples, and hope this framework will be useful for designing future visual analytics systems.

We show several examples on the uses of Obvious, how the different toolkits can be combined, for instance sharing their data models. We also show how Weka and Rapid-Miner, two popular machine-learning toolkits, have been wrapped with Obvious and can be used directly with all the other wrapped toolkits.

It is also designed to help information visualization systems adhere to the best practices to provide a higher level of interoperability and leverage the domain of visual analytics.","article_number":"6102446","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102446","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102446/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102446/","publication_title":"2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Providence, RI, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2011","publication_number":6093899,"is_number":6102423,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2011","start_page":"91","end_page":"100","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":394,"insert_date":"20111215","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Data models","Visualization","Observers","Libraries","Java"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Information","Data Model","Visual System","Interoperability","Consensual","Vision Applications","RapidMiner","Rapid Mineralization","Java Language","Data Structure","Software Development","Development Of Applications","Geometric Structure","Application Programming Interface","Programming Interface","Application Programming","Visual Model","Visualization Techniques","Work Unit","Transaction Database","Caching","Design Patterns","Scientific Visualization","Obvious Components","Unit Tests","Memory Footprint","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Visual Components","Graph Layout","Graph Drawing","JavaScript","Notification System"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0015-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0014-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2011.6102459","title":"A visual navigation system for querying neural stem cell imaging data","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-0015-5","partnum":"11EX5936","rank":56,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38019808500","id":38019808500,"full_name":"Ishwar Kulkarni","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38232233400","id":38232233400,"full_name":"Shanaz Y.

Current time-lapse imaging microscopes help us capture the progress of experiments at intervals that allow for understanding of the dynamic and kinematic behavior of the cells. On the other hand, these devices generate such massive amounts of data (250GB of data per experiment) that manual sieving of data to identify interesting patterns becomes virtually impossible. In this paper we propose an end-to-end system to analyze time-lapse images of the cultures of human neural stem cells (hNSC), that includes an image processing system to analyze the images to extract all the relevant geometric and statistical features within and between images, a database management system to manage and handle queries on the data, a visual analytic system to navigate through the data, and a visual query system to explore different relationships and correlations between the parameters. In each stage of the pipeline we make novel algorithmic and conceptual contributions, and the entire system design is motivated by many different yet unanswered exploratory questions pursued by our neurobiologist collaborators. With a few examples we show how such abstract biological queries can be analyzed and answered by our system.","article_number":"6102459","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102459","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102459/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6102459/","publication_title":"2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Providence, RI, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2011","publication_number":6093899,"is_number":6102423,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2011","start_page":"211","end_page":"220","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":276,"insert_date":"20111215","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image segmentation","Navigation","Semantics","Data visualization","Cells (biology)","Visualization","Shape"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Neuroscience","stem cell segmentation","tracking","cell imaging","data management","visual analytics","navigation","exploration","query processing"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Neurons","Stem Cells","Progenitor Cells","Imaging Data","Cell Imaging","Visual System","Neural Stem Cells","Navigation System","Machine Vision","Visual Navigation","Culture Imaging","Human Neural Stem Cells","Pipeline Stages","Query System","Cell Death","Mitotic","Mitosis","Data Management","Data Storage","Cell Area","Exploratory Data","Cell Binding","Cell Boundaries","Raw Images","Visual Representation Of Data","Watershed Segmentation","Watershed Segmentation Algorithm","Watershed Transform","Watershed Algorithm","Relational Database Management System","Relational Database System","RDBMS","Cell Speed","Flat Files","Morphological Operations","Segmentation Module","Semantic Data","Difference Of Gaussian","Cell Tracking"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0015-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0014-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2011.6102432","title":"How editing and design changes news graphics","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-0015-5","partnum":"11EX5936","rank":57,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"The New York Times, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38021015100","id":38021015100,"full_name":"Amanda Cox","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The New York Times, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"The Times graphics department has won many national and international awards, including the National Design Award for communication design.
