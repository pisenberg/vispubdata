For multi-objective problems, however, a single best solution often does not exist. In this case, it is necessary to analyze trade-offs between many conflicting goals within a given application context. This poster describes an approach that tightly integrates automatic algorithms for multi-objective optimization and interactive multivariate visualizations. Ad-hoc selections support a flexible definition of input data for subsequent algorithms. These algorithms in turn represent their result as derived data attributes that can be assigned to visualizations or be used as a basis for further selections (e.g., to constrain the result set). This enables a guided search that still involves the knowledge of domain experts. We describe our approach in the context of multi-run simulation data from the application domain of car engine design.","article_number":"5651694","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5651694","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5651694/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5651694/","publication_title":"2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","conference_dates":"25-26 Oct. 2010","publication_number":5638583,"is_number":5649053,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"25-26 Oct. 2010","start_page":"215","end_page":"216","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":296,"insert_date":"20101210","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Optimization","Engines","Data visualization","Context","Load modeling","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["H.1.2 [Models and Principles]: User/Machine Systems-Human factors","H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: User Interfaces-Interaction Styles"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9488-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9487-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2010.5652968","title":"EmailTime: Visual analytics of emails","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-9488-0","partnum":"10EX4986","rank":3,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"SIAT, Simon Fraser University, Surrey, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37598482000","id":37598482000,"full_name":"Minoo Erfani Joorabchi","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SIAT, Simon Fraser University, Surrey, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"SIAT, Simon Fraser University, Surrey, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37605674700","id":37605674700,"full_name":"Ji-Dong Yim","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SIAT, Simon Fraser University, Surrey, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"SIAT, Simon Fraser University, Surrey, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37358198200","id":37358198200,"full_name":"Christopher D.

As users interact with and explore data in a visual analytics environment they are each developing their own unique analytic process. The goal of ALIDA is to observe and record the human-computer interactions and utilize these observations as a means of supporting user exploration; ALIDA does this by using interaction to make decision about user interest. As such, ALIDA is designed to track the decision history (interactions) of a user. This history is then utilized to enhance the user's decision-making process by allowing the user to return to previously visited search states, as well as providing suggestions of other search states that may be of interest based on past exploration modalities. The agent passes these suggestions (or decisions) back to an interactive visualization prototype, and these suggestions are used to guide the user, either by suggesting searches or changes to the visualization view. Current work has tested ALIDA under the exploration of homonyms for users wishing to explore word linkages within a dictionary. Ongoing work includes using ALIDA to guide users in transfer function design for volume rendering within scientific gateways.","article_number":"5650854","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5650854","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5650854/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5650854/","publication_title":"2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","conference_dates":"25-26 Oct. 2010","publication_number":5638583,"is_number":5649053,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"25-26 Oct. 2010","start_page":"223","end_page":"224","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":382,"insert_date":"20101210","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Cognition","Humans","Visual analytics","History","Data visualization","Rendering (computer graphics)","Transfer functions"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["artificial intelligence","cognition","intent discernment","volume rendering"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9488-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9487-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2010.5650766","title":"Visual analysis of frequent patterns in large time series","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-9488-0","partnum":"10EX4986","rank":13,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hewlett Packard Laboratories, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274264300","id":37274264300,"full_name":"M.

The attribute subset is used for the construction of a classifier function. In order to cope with the challenge of scalability, the analysis is split into an overview of all attributes and a detailed analysis of small groups of attributes. The overview provides generic information on statistical dependencies between attributes. With this information the user can select groups of attributes and an analytical method for their detailed analysis. The detailed analysis involves the identification of redundant attributes (via classification or regression) and the creation of summarizing attributes (via clustering or dimension reduction). Our strategy does not prescribe specific analytical methods. Instead, we recursively combine the results of different methods to find or generate a subset of attributes to use for classification.","article_number":"5654445","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5654445","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5654445/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5654445/","publication_title":"2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","conference_dates":"25-26 Oct. 2010","publication_number":5638583,"is_number":5649053,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"25-26 Oct. 2010","start_page":"239","end_page":"240","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":180,"insert_date":"20101210","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Data visualization","Clustering methods","Testing","USA Councils","Electronic mail"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["High-Dimensional Data","Dimensionality Reduction","Data Clustering","Data Filtering"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9488-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9487-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2010.5651676","title":"Cluster correspondence views for enhanced analysis of SOM displays","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-9488-0","partnum":"10EX4986","rank":17,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Interactive Graphics Systems Group, Darmstadt, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606179600","id":37606179600,"full_name":"Jürgen Bernard","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Interactive Graphics Systems Group, Darmstadt, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer IGD, Darmstadt, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586276100","id":37586276100,"full_name":"Tatiana von Landesberger","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer IGD, Darmstadt, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Interactive Graphics Systems Group, Darmstadt, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586274500","id":37586274500,"full_name":"Sebastian Bremm","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Interactive Graphics Systems Group, Darmstadt, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Interactive Graphics Systems Group, Darmstadt, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282557600","id":37282557600,"full_name":"Tobias Schreck","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Interactive Graphics Systems Group, Darmstadt, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm is a popular and widely used cluster algorithm.

CoCo is a text classification software that takes hospital admittance fields and classifies them into chief complaint categories (Botulinic, Constitutional, Gastrointestinal, Hemorrhagic, Neurological, Rash, Respiratory, and Other). The choice of the CoCo classifier was based on its online availability as well as its well documented classification performance metrics, see [1]. Once the data was classified, we utilized and extended work done by the Purdue University Visual Analytics Center on healthcare analysis [2]. Our system consists of a combination of linked views, showing time series views of syndromes and death rates through line graph views (Figure 1 — Top), stacked graph views showing deaths (Figure 1 — Bottom), geographical map views showing the impact by country (not illustrated in this paper), and summary windows providing statistical breakdowns of the data (not illustrated in this paper). All views are linked through an interactive time slider that allows users to explore the data over time. Extensions to our previous work [2] include the stacked graph view, summary windows, new control chart methods, and an interactive ‘tape measure’ tool.","article_number":"5652661","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652661","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652661/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652661/","publication_title":"2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","conference_dates":"25-26 Oct. 2010","publication_number":5638583,"is_number":5649053,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"25-26 Oct. 2010","start_page":"281","end_page":"282","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":477,"insert_date":"20101210","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Time series analysis","Pandemics","Admittance","Visual analytics","Gastrointestinal tract","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Hospitals"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9488-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9487-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2010.5653822","title":"Data representation and exploration with Geometric Wavelets","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-9488-0","partnum":"10EX4986","rank":20,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Duke Visualization Technology Group, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37597529800","id":37597529800,"full_name":"Eric E.

We are now accumulating information about biological sequences, structures, and interactions faster than we have the power to make sense of them. For hundreds of years prior to this, practical considerations coerced biological research into reductionism. There are simply too many components in a biological system for a biologist to examine the whole picture with the tools formerly available. Over the past decade this has rapidly changed as biological information has become cheap and plentiful due to the advent of high-throughput tools, making it possible for the frst time to ask questions on time and length scales that were previously intractable. The relaxation of the practical limitations on systems-level analysis has also brought a change in the philosophy of how we regard biology, moving towards a holistic method of research and interpretation. This places systems biology in stark contrast to traditional biological research, and for good reason. In the words of Denis Noble, “Systems biology is about putting together rather than taking apart, integration rather than reduction. It starts with what we have learned from the reductionist approach; and then it goes further.” This shift from reductionism is essential, for as we know from studying complex systems, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. With this new approach we are able to explore scientifc territory that has previously been untouched due to physical impossibility and philosophical differences. The complexity of the tangled web of nonlinear interactions between genes, proteins, and the environment necessitates the development of simplifed models to illuminate biological functions. Merely generating networks of interactions is not enough, providing us with far too much information in a single view without emphasizing the important features of the map. When we use Google maps and look at a picture of the United States it doesn't show us every city, we would never see Evanston, Illinois being shown at that level of detail.

Once we zoom in other smaller cities and features become visible, giving us more relevant information in a manner that is usable.

Fine-grained computational simulation of folding events from a protein's synthesis to its final stable structure remains computationally intractable. Therefore, methods which derive constraints from other sources are attractive. To date, constraints derived from known structures have proven to be highly successful. However, these cannot be applied to molecules with no identifiable neighbors having already-determined structures. For such molecules, structural constraints must be derived in other ways. One popular approach has been the statistical analysis of large families of proteins, with the hope that residues that “change together” (co-evolve) imply that those residues are in contact. Unfortunately, despite repeated attempts to use this data to deduce structural constraints, this approach has met with minimal success. The consensus of current literature concludes that there is simply too little information contained within the correlated mutations of many protein families to reliably and generally predict structural constraints. Recent work in my laboratory challenges this conclusion. For some time we have been developing methods (MAVL/StickWRLD) to visualize the pattern of co-evolved mutations within sequence families. While our analysis of individual correlations agrees with the literature consensus, we have recently discovered that the visualized pattern of correlations is highly suggestive of structural relationships. In our preliminary test cases, human researchers can unambiguously determine many positive structural constraints by visual analysis of statistical sequence information alone, often with no training on interpretation of the visualization results. Herein we report the visualization design that supports this Visual Analytics approach to identifying high-confidence hypotheses about protein folding from protein sequence, and illustrate preliminary results from this research. Our approach entails a higher-dimensional extension of parallel coordinates which illuminates distant shared sub-tuples of the vectors representing each protein sequence when these sub-tuples occur with an over abundance compared to expectations. It simultaneously eliminates all representations of tuples which occur with frequency near the expected norm. The result is a minimally-occluded representation of outlier, and only outlier co-occurrences within the sequence families.","article_number":"5650199","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5650199","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5650199/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5650199/","publication_title":"2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","conference_dates":"25-26 Oct. 2010","publication_number":5638583,"is_number":5649053,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"25-26 Oct. 2010","start_page":"249","end_page":"250","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":194,"insert_date":"20101210","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Correlation","Protein sequence","Clouds","Visual analytics","Protein engineering"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Bioinformatics","Clustering Classification and Association Rules","Interactive Data Exploration"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9488-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9487-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2010.5650251","title":"Poster: Translating cross-filtered queries into questions","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-9488-0","partnum":"10EX4986","rank":26,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Center for Spatial Analysis, University of Oklahama, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089143579","id":37089143579,"full_name":"Maryam Nafari","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Center for Spatial Analysis, University of Oklahama, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Center for Spatial Analysis, University of Oklahama, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564883300","id":37564883300,"full_name":"Chris Weaver","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Center for Spatial Analysis, University of Oklahama, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Complex combinations of coordinated multiple views are increasingly used to design tools for highly interactive visual exploration and analysis of multidimensional data. While complex coordination patterns provide substantial utility through expressive querying, they also exhibit usability problems for users when learning required interaction sequences, recalling past queries, and interpreting visual states. As visual analysis tools grow more sophisticated, there is a growing need to make them more understandable as well. Our long-term goal is to exploit natural language familiarity and literacy to directly facilitate individual and collaborative use of visual analysis tools. In this poster, we present work in progress on an automatically generated query-to-question user interface to translate interactive states during visual analysis into an accompanying visual log of formatted text. Our effort currently focuses on a symmetric and thus relatively simple coordination pattern: cross-filtered views. We describe our current thinking about query-to-question translation in a typical cross-filtered visualization of movies, people, and genres in the Internet Movie Database.","article_number":"5650251","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5650251","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5650251/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5650251/","publication_title":"2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","conference_dates":"25-26 Oct. 2010","publication_number":5638583,"is_number":5649053,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"25-26 Oct. 2010","start_page":"245","end_page":"246","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":156,"insert_date":"20101210","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Data visualization","Natural languages","Motion pictures","Weaving","Internet","Encoding"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Coordinated multiple views","cross-filtered queries","interaction states","natural language generation","visual provenance"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9488-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9487-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2010.5651204","title":"VisWorks text and network visual analytics","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-9488-0","partnum":"10EX4986","rank":27,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"IBM Research, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085394737","id":37085394737,"full_name":"Lei Shi","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IBM Research, China"]}},{"affiliation":"IBM Research, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086626202","id":37086626202,"full_name":"Weihong Qian","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IBM Research, China"]}},{"affiliation":"IBM Research, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085490145","id":37085490145,"full_name":"Furu Wei","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IBM Research, China"]}},{"affiliation":"IBM Research, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37597343100","id":37597343100,"full_name":"Li Tan","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IBM Research, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"VAST 2010 Mini Challenge 1 Award: “Effective interactive visualization of document contents”.

This paper presents an exploratory study of a system designed to support collaborative visual analysis tasks on a digital tabletop display. Fifteen participant pairs employed Cam-biera, a visual analytics system, to solve a problem involving 240 digital documents. Our analysis, supported by observations, system logs, questionnaires, and interview data, explores how pairs approached the problem around the table. We contribute a unique, rich understanding of how users worked together around the table and identify eight types of collaboration styles that can be used to identify how closely people work together while problem solving. We show how the closeness of teams' collaboration influenced how well they performed on the task overall. We further discuss the role of the tabletop for visual analytics tasks and derive novel design implications for future co-located collaborative tabletop problem solving systems.","article_number":"5652880","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652880","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652880/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652880/","publication_title":"2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","conference_dates":"25-26 Oct. 2010","publication_number":5638583,"is_number":5649053,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"25-26 Oct. 2010","start_page":"179","end_page":"186","citing_paper_count":64,"citing_patent_count":2,"download_count":783,"insert_date":"20101210","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Collaboration","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Problem-solving","Image color analysis","Context","Video coding"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["K.5.3 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: Group and Organization Interfaces"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9488-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9487-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2010.5652467","title":"Anomaly detection in GPS data based on visual analytics","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-9488-0","partnum":"10EX4986","rank":33,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Illinois, Urbana, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591746700","id":37591746700,"full_name":"Zicheng Liao","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Illinois, Urbana, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37578164900","id":37578164900,"full_name":"Yizhou Yu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37600013700","id":37600013700,"full_name":"Baoquan Chen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Modern machine learning techniques provide robust approaches for data-driven modeling and critical information extraction, while human experts hold the advantage of possessing high-level intelligence and domain-specific expertise.

In this paper we introduce GPSvas (GPS Visual Analytics System), a system that detects anomalies in GPS data using the approach of visual analytics: a conditional random field (CRF) model is used as the machine learning component for anomaly detection in streaming GPS traces. A visualization component and an interactive user interface are built to visualize the data stream, display significant analysis results (i.e., anomalies or uncertain predications) and hidden information extracted by the anomaly detection model, which enable human experts to observe the real-time data behavior and gain insights into the data flow.

Efficient visual analytical techniques are required to extract the information content in these data. The large number of possible projections for each method, which usually grow quadrat-ically or even exponentially with the number of dimensions, urges the necessity to employ automatic reduction techniques, automatic sorting or selecting the projections, based on their information-bearing content. Different quality measures have been successfully applied for several specified user tasks and established visualization techniques, like Scatterplots, Scatterplot Matrices or Parallel Coordinates. Many other popular visualization techniques exist, but due to the structural differences, the measures are not directly applicable to them and new approaches are needed. In this paper we propose new quality measures for three popular visualization methods: Radviz, Pixel-Oriented Displays and Table Lenses. Our experiments show that these measures efficiently guide the visual analysis task.","article_number":"5652433","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652433","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652433/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652433/","publication_title":"2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","conference_dates":"25-26 Oct. 2010","publication_number":5638583,"is_number":5649053,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"25-26 Oct. 2010","start_page":"19","end_page":"26","citing_paper_count":50,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":952,"insert_date":"20101210","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Pixel","Data visualization","Visualization","Noise","Lenses","Image color analysis","Clustering algorithms"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["H.3.3 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Information Search and Retrieval","I.3.3 [Computer Graphics]: Picture/Image Generation"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9488-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9487-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2010.5652460","title":"Flow-based scatterplots for sensitivity analysis","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-9488-0","partnum":"10EX4986","rank":36,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593323300","id":37593323300,"full_name":"Yu-Hsuan Chan","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282925900","id":37282925900,"full_name":"Carlos D.

One of the main causes for this problem is the inherent loss of information that occurs when high-dimensional data is projected into 2D or 3D. Although 2D scatterplots are ubiquitous due to their simplicity and familiarity, there are not a lot of variations on their basic metaphor. In this paper, we present a new way of visualizing multidimensional data using scatterplots. We extend 2D scatterplots using sensitivity coefficients to highlight local variation of one variable with respect to another. When applied to a scatterplot, these sensitivities can be understood as velocities, and the resulting visualization resembles a flow field. We also present a number of operations, based on flow-field analysis, that help users navigate, select and cluster points in an efficient manner. We show the flexibility and generality of this approach using a number of multidimensional data sets across different domains.","article_number":"5652460","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652460","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652460/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652460/","publication_title":"2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","conference_dates":"25-26 Oct. 2010","publication_number":5638583,"is_number":5649053,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"25-26 Oct. 2010","start_page":"43","end_page":"50","citing_paper_count":44,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":727,"insert_date":"20101210","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Correlation","Sensitivity analysis","Navigation","Data visualization","Visualization","Complexity theory"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty","Data Transformations","Principal Component Analysis","Model Fitting"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9488-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9487-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2010.5653587","title":"Towards the Personal Equation of Interaction: The impact of personality factors on visual analytics interface interaction","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-9488-0","partnum":"10EX4986","rank":37,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University, Surrey, BC, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403562900","id":37403562900,"full_name":"Tear Marie Green","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University, Surrey, BC, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University, Surrey, BC, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267458000","id":37267458000,"full_name":"Brian Fisher","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University, Surrey, BC, Canada"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"These current studies explored the impact of individual differences in personality factors on interface interaction and learning performance behaviors in both an interactive visualization and a menu-driven web table in two studies.

The second application clusters a selection of large amounts of financial time series data according to their similarity, and analyzes the distribution of the assets among market sectors. This allows users to identify the characteristic graphs which are representative for the development of a particular market sector, and also to identify the assets which behave considerably differently compared to other assets in the same sector.

In this paper, we propose a data model that can be used to represent most of the text corpora. Such a data model contains four basic types of facets: time, category, content (unstructured), and structured facet. To understand the corpus with such a data model, we develop a hybrid visualization by combining the trend graph with tag-clouds. We encode the four types of data facets with four separate visual dimensions. To help people discover evolutionary and correlation patterns, we also develop several visual interaction methods that allow people to interactively analyze text by one or more facets.

To reduce human effort, Automated Insight Externalization (AIE) is desired. Most existing IE approaches achieve automation by capturing events (e.g., clicks and key presses) or actions (e.g., panning and zooming). In this paper, we propose a novel AIE approach named Click2Annotate. It allows semi-automatic insight annotation that captures low-level analytics task results (e.g., clusters and outliers), which have higher semantic richness and abstraction levels than actions and events. Click2Annotate has two significant benefits. First, it reduces human effort required in IE and generates annotations easy to understand.

The main approach of the design is to combine individual workspace and shared visualization in an integrated environment. Collaborating analysts will be able to identify concepts and relationships from the dataset based on keyword searches in their own workspace and collaborate visually with other analysts using visualization tools such as a concept map view and a timeline view. The system allows analysts to parallelize the work by dividing initial sets of concepts, investigating them on their own workspace, and then integrating individual findings automatically on shared visualizations with support for interaction and personal graph layout in real time, in order to develop a unified plot. We highlight several design considerations that promote communication and analytic performance in small team synchronous collaboration. We report the result of a pair of case study applications including collaboration and communication methods, analysis strategies, and user behaviors under a competition setting in the same location at the same time. The results of these demonstrate the tool's effectiveness for synchronous collaborative construction and use of visualizations in intelligence data analysis.","article_number":"5652932","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652932","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652932/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652932/","publication_title":"2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","conference_dates":"25-26 Oct. 2010","publication_number":5638583,"is_number":5649053,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"25-26 Oct. 2010","start_page":"107","end_page":"114","citing_paper_count":29,"citing_patent_count":5,"download_count":685,"insert_date":"20101210","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Collaboration","Data visualization","Visual analytics","Layout","Servers","Keyword search","Text analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Collaborative visualization","text and document data","intelligence analysis"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9488-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9487-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2010.5652478","title":"Discovering bits of place histories from people's activity traces","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-9488-0","partnum":"10EX4986","rank":42,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer Institute IAIS (Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems), Sankt Augustin, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047100","id":37283047100,"full_name":"Gennady Andrienko","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute IAIS (Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems), Sankt Augustin, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer Institute IAIS (Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems), Sankt Augustin, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047700","id":37283047700,"full_name":"Natalia Andrienko","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute IAIS (Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems), Sankt Augustin, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer Institute IAIS (Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems), Sankt Augustin, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37545515700","id":37545515700,"full_name":"Martin Mladenov","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute IAIS (Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems), Sankt Augustin, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer Institute IAIS (Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems), Sankt Augustin, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088163375","id":37088163375,"full_name":"Michael Mock","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute IAIS (Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems), Sankt Augustin, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer Institute IAIS (Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems), Sankt Augustin, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37589346900","id":37589346900,"full_name":"Christian Pölitz","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute IAIS (Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems), Sankt Augustin, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Events that happened in the past are important for understanding the ongoing processes, predicting future developments, and making informed decisions.

Modern astronomical surveys provide not only image data but also catalogues of millions of objects (stars, galaxies), each object with hundreds of associated parameters. Exploration of this very high-dimensional data space poses a huge challenge. Subspace clustering is one among several approaches which have been proposed for this purpose in recent years. However, many clustering algorithms require the user to set a large number of parameters without any guidelines. Some methods also do not provide a concise summary of the datasets, or, if they do, they lack additional important information such as the number of clusters present or the significance of the clusters. In this paper, we propose a method for ranking subspaces for clustering which overcomes many of the above limitations. First we carry out a transformation from parametric space to discrete image space where the data are represented by a grid-based density field. Then we apply so-called connected morphological operators on this density field of astronomical objects that provides visual support for the analysis of the important subspaces. Clusters in subspaces correspond to high-intensity regions in the density image. The importance of a cluster is measured by a new quality criterion based on the dynamics of local maxima of the density. Connected operators are able to extract such regions with an indication of the number of clusters present. The subspaces are visualized during computation of the quality measure, so that the user can interact with the system to improve the results. In the result stage, we use three visualization toolkits linked within a graphical user interface so that the user can perform an in-depth exploration of the ranked subspaces. Evaluation based on synthetic as well as real astronomical datasets demonstrates the power of the new method. We recover various known astronomical relations directly from the data with little or no a priori assumptions. Hence, our method holds good prospects for discovering new relations as well.","article_number":"5652450","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652450","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652450/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652450/","publication_title":"2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","conference_dates":"25-26 Oct. 2010","publication_number":5638583,"is_number":5649053,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"25-26 Oct. 2010","start_page":"35","end_page":"42","citing_paper_count":24,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":567,"insert_date":"20101210","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Smoothing methods","Shape","Estimation","Noise","Principal component analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Subspace finding","clustering high-dimensional data","connected morphological operators","visual exploration","astronomical data"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9488-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9487-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2010.5652940","title":"Two-stage framework for a topology-based projection and visualization of classified document collections","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-9488-0","partnum":"10EX4986","rank":45,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Leipzig, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403135200","id":37403135200,"full_name":"Patrick Oesterling","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Leipzig, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Leipzig, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282574800","id":37282574800,"full_name":"Gerik Scheuermann","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Leipzig, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Leipzig, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591211600","id":37591211600,"full_name":"Sven Teresniak","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Leipzig, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Leipzig, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591211200","id":37591211200,"full_name":"Gerhard Heyer","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Leipzig, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593029700","id":37593029700,"full_name":"Steffen Koch","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268023800","id":37268023800,"full_name":"Thomas Ertl","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37411444100","id":37411444100,"full_name":"Gunther H.

In many domains not only the risk of a wrong decision, but in particular the trade-off between the costs of possible decisions are of utmost importance. In this paper we describe a framework tightly integrating interactive visual exploration with machine learning to support the decision making process. The proposed approach uses a series of interactive 2D visualizations of numeric and ordinal data combined with visualization of classification models. These series of visual elements are further linked to the classifier's performance visualized using an interactive performance curve. An interactive decision point on the performance curve allows the decision maker to steer the classification model and instantly identify the critical, cost changing data elements, in the various linked visualizations. The critical data elements are represented as images in order to trigger associations related to the knowledge of the expert. In this context the data visualization and classification results are not only linked together, but are also linked back to the classification model. Such a visual analytics framework allows the user to interactively explore the costs of his decisions for different settings of the model and accordingly use the most suitable classification model and make more informed and reliable decisions.

Evaluations provide evidence that VizPattern is applicable in many domains, and that it enables a wide variety of users to answer questions about temporal data faster and with fewer errors than existing state-of-the-art visual analysis systems.","article_number":"5652890","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652890","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652890/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652890/","publication_title":"2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","conference_dates":"25-26 Oct. 2010","publication_number":5638583,"is_number":5649053,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"25-26 Oct. 2010","start_page":"163","end_page":"170","citing_paper_count":18,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":569,"insert_date":"20101210","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Strips","Data visualization","Pain","Time series analysis","Visualization","Stomach","Data analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: User Interface-User-centered design","H.3.3 [Information Systems]: Information Search and Retrieval-Query formulation"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9488-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9487-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2010.5652520","title":"Multidimensional data dissection using attribute relationship graphs","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-9488-0","partnum":"10EX4986","rank":48,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Center for Spatial Analysis, University of Oklahama, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564883300","id":37564883300,"full_name":"Chris Weaver","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Center for Spatial Analysis, University of Oklahama, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Visual exploration and analysis is a process of discovering and dissecting the abundant and complex attribute relationships that pervade multidimensional data. Recent research has identified and characterized patterns of multiple coordinated views, such as cross-filtered views, in which rapid sequences of simple interactions can be used to express queries on subsets of attribute values. In visualizations designed around these patterns, for the most part, distinct views serve to visually isolate each attribute from the others. Although the brush-and-click simplicity of visual isolation facilitates discovery of many-to-many relationships between attributes, dissecting these relationships into more fine-grained one-to-many relationships is interactively tedious and, worse, visually fragmented over prolonged sequences of queries. This paper describes: (1) a method for interactively dissecting multidimensional data by iteratively slicing and manipulating a multigraph representation of data values and value co-occurrences; and (2) design strategies for extending the construction of coordinated multiple view interfaces for dissection as well as discovery of attribute relationships in multidimensional data sets. Using examples from different domains, we describe how attribute relationship graphs can be combined with cross-filtered views, modularized for reuse across designs, and integrated into broader visual analysis tools. The exploratory and analytic utility of these examples suggests that an attribute relationship graph would be a useful addition to a wide variety of visual analysis tools.","article_number":"5652520","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652520","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652520/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652520/","publication_title":"2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","conference_dates":"25-26 Oct. 2010","publication_number":5638583,"is_number":5649053,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"25-26 Oct. 2010","start_page":"75","end_page":"82","citing_paper_count":14,"citing_patent_count":3,"download_count":476,"insert_date":"20101210","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Awards activities","Motion pictures","Data visualization","Pipelines","Layout","Encoding"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["D.2.2 [Software Engineering]: Design Tools and Techniques-[User Interfaces]","H.2.3 [Information Systems]: Database Management-[Languages]","H.5.2 [Information Systems]: Information Interfaces and Presentation-[User Interfaces]"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9488-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9487-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2010.5652910","title":"NetClinic: Interactive visualization to enhance automated fault diagnosis in enterprise networks","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-9488-0","partnum":"10EX4986","rank":49,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, Microsoft Research Limited, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592993600","id":37592993600,"full_name":"Zhicheng Liu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Microsoft Research Limited, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Limited, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37293389400","id":37293389400,"full_name":"Bongshin Lee","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Limited, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591286400","id":37591286400,"full_name":"Srikanth Kandula","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Limited, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37603074200","id":37603074200,"full_name":"Ratul Mahajan","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Diagnosing faults in an operational computer network is a frustrating, time-consuming exercise. Despite advances, automatic diagnostic tools are far from perfect: they occasionally miss the true culprit and are mostly only good at narrowing down the search to a few potential culprits. This uncertainty and the inability to extract useful sense from tool output renders most tools not usable to administrators. To bridge this gap, we present NetClinic, a visual analytics system that couples interactive visualization with an automated diagnostic tool for enterprise networks. It enables administrators to verify the output of the automatic analysis at different levels of detail and to move seamlessly across levels while retaining appropriate context. A qualitative user study shows that NetClinic users can accurately identify the culprit, even when it is not present in the suggestions made by the automated component. We also find that supporting a variety of sensemaking strategies is a key to the success of systems that enhance automated diagnosis.","article_number":"5652910","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652910","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652910/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652910/","publication_title":"2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","conference_dates":"25-26 Oct. 2010","publication_number":5638583,"is_number":5649053,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"25-26 Oct. 2010","start_page":"131","end_page":"138","citing_paper_count":12,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":303,"insert_date":"20101210","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Layout","Radiation detectors","Visualization","Cognition","Electronic mail","Semantics","Servers"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Sensemaking","Semantic Graph Layout","Visual Analytics","Network Diagnosis","Information Visualization"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9488-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9487-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2010.5652896","title":"Real-time aggregation of Wikipedia data for visual analytics","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-9488-0","partnum":"10EX4986","rank":50,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research-INRIA Joint Centre, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37325862800","id":37325862800,"full_name":"Nadia Boukhelifa","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research-INRIA Joint Centre, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research-INRIA Joint Centre, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37395495900","id":37395495900,"full_name":"Fanny Chevalier","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research-INRIA Joint Centre, France"]}},{"affiliation":"INRIA, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407972900","id":37407972900,"full_name":"Jean-Daniel Fekete","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["INRIA, France"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Wikipedia has been built to gather encyclopedic knowledge using a collaborative social process that has proved its effectiveness.

We present an assistive visualization system which greatly reduces the load on the users and makes the process of model initialization and refinement more efficient, problem-driven, and engaging. Utilizing a sequence segmentation task with a Hidden Markov Model as an example, we assign each token in the sequence a feature vector based on its various properties within the sequence. These vectors are then clustered according to similarity, generating a layout of the individual tokens in form of a node link diagram where the length of the links is determined by the feature vector similarity. Users may then tune the weights of the feature vector components to improve the segmentation, which is visualized as a better separation of the clusters. Also, as individual clusters represent different classes, the user can now work at the cluster level to define token classes, instead of labelling one entry at time. Inconsistent entries visually identify themselves by locating at the periphery of clusters, and the user then helps refine the model by resolving these inconsistencies. Our system therefore makes efficient use of the knowledge of its users, only requesting user assistance for non-trivial data items. It so allows users to visually analyse data at a higher, more abstract level, improving scalability.","article_number":"5652484","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652484","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652484/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652484/","publication_title":"2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","conference_dates":"25-26 Oct. 2010","publication_number":5638583,"is_number":5649053,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"25-26 Oct. 2010","start_page":"67","end_page":"74","citing_paper_count":11,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":548,"insert_date":"20101210","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Hidden Markov models","Image segmentation","Analytical models","Data models","Visualization","Computational modeling","Layout"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual Knowledge Discovery","Visual Knowledge Representation","Data Clustering","Human-Computer Interaction"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9488-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9487-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2010.5652879","title":"A closer look at note taking in the co-located collaborative visual analytics process","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-9488-0","partnum":"10EX4986","rank":52,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Victoria, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591344800","id":37591344800,"full_name":"Narges Mahyar","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Victoria, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Victoria, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591344300","id":37591344300,"full_name":"Ali Sarvghad","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Victoria, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Victoria, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275861300","id":37275861300,"full_name":"Melanie Tory","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Victoria, Canada"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"This paper highlights the important role that record-keeping (i.e. taking notes and saving charts) plays in collaborative data analysis within the business domain.

Thus visual analytics tools to support these activities must incorporate context. But, context is a difficult concept to define, model, and represent. Creating and representing context in support of visually-enabled reasoning about complex problems with complex information is a complementary but different challenge than that addressed in context-aware computing. In the latter, the goal is automated adaptation of the system to meet user needs for applications such as mobile location-based services where information about the location, the user, and the user goals filters what gets presented on a small mobile device. In contrast, for visual analytics-enabled information foraging and sensemaking, the user is likely to take an active role in foraging for the contextual information needed to support sensemaking in relation to some multifaceted problem. In this paper, we address the challenges of constructing and representing context within visual interfaces that support analytical reasoning in crisis management and humanitarian relief. The challenges stem from the diverse forms of information that can provide context and difficulty in defining and operationalizing context itself. Here, we pay particular attention to document foraging to support construction of the geographic and historical context within which monitoring and sensemaking can be carried out. Specifically, we present the concept of geo-historical context (GHC) and outline an empirical assessment of both the concept and its implementation in the Context Discovery Application, a web-based tool that supports document foraging and sensemaking.","article_number":"5652895","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652895","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652895/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652895/","publication_title":"2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","conference_dates":"25-26 Oct. 2010","publication_number":5638583,"is_number":5649053,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"25-26 Oct. 2010","start_page":"139","end_page":"146","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":354,"insert_date":"20101210","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Context","Cognition","Context modeling","Ontologies","Computational modeling","Semantics","Data models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["context","foraging","sensemaking","mapping","text analysis","geographic information retrieval"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9488-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9487-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2010.5653599","title":"Comparing different levels of interaction constraints for deriving visual problem isomorphs","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-9488-0","partnum":"10EX4986","rank":54,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606064200","id":37606064200,"full_name":"Wenwen Dou","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37548028800","id":37548028800,"full_name":"Caroline Ziemkiewicz","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546111900","id":37546111900,"full_name":"Lane Harrison","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37400451800","id":37400451800,"full_name":"Dong Hyun Jeong","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37603814100","id":37603814100,"full_name":"Roxanne Ryan","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300425000","id":37300425000,"full_name":"William Ribarsky","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601069300","id":37601069300,"full_name":"Xiaoyu Wang","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA","Tufts University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592409400","id":37592409400,"full_name":"Remco Chang","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Interaction and manual manipulation have been shown in the cognitive science literature to play a critical role in problem solving. Given different types of interactions or constraints on interactions, a problem can appear to have different degrees of difficulty.

In this paper, we hypothesize that constraints on interactions and constraints encoded in visual representations can lead to strategies of varying effectiveness during problem solving. To test our hypothesis, we conducted a user study in which participants were given different levels of interaction constraints when solving a simple math game called Number Scrabble. Number Scrabble is known to have an optimal visual problem isomorph, and the goal of this study is to learn if and how the participants could derive the isomorph and to analyze the strategies that the participants utilize in solving the problem. Our results indicate that constraints on interactions do affect problem solving, and that while the optimal visual isomorph is difficult to derive, certain interaction constraints can lead to a higher chance of deriving the isomorph.","article_number":"5653599","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5653599","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5653599/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5653599/","publication_title":"2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","conference_dates":"25-26 Oct. 2010","publication_number":5638583,"is_number":5649053,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"25-26 Oct. 2010","start_page":"195","end_page":"202","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":204,"insert_date":"20101210","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Games","Problem-solving","Time factors","Cognition","Computers"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Interaction","Visual Isomorph","Problem Solving"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9488-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9487-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2010.5652926","title":"Visual readability analysis: How to make your writings easier to read","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-9488-0","partnum":"10EX4986","rank":55,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591207400","id":37591207400,"full_name":"Daniela Oelke","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601354600","id":37601354600,"full_name":"David Spretke","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592880100","id":37592880100,"full_name":"Andreas Stoffel","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","id":37283138700,"full_name":"Daniel A.

In the second part, we present the visual analysis tool VisRA, which allows the user to analyze the feature values across the text and within single sentences. The user can choose different visual representations accounting for differences in the size of the documents and the availability of information about the physical and logical layout of the documents. We put special emphasis on providing as much transparency as possible to ensure that the user can purposefully improve the readability of a sentence. Several case-studies are presented that show the wide range of applicability of our tool.","article_number":"5652926","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5652926","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652926/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652926/","publication_title":"2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","conference_dates":"25-26 Oct. 2010","publication_number":5638583,"is_number":5649053,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"25-26 Oct. 2010","start_page":"123","end_page":"130","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":558,"insert_date":"20101210","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Vocabulary","Correlation","Image color analysis","Complexity theory","Length measurement","Navigation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["I.7.5 [Document and Text Processing]: Document Capture-Document Analysis","I.5.2 [Pattern Recognition]: Design Methodology-Feature evaluation and selection"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9488-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9487-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2010.5651483","title":"International Program Committee","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-9488-0","partnum":"10EX4986","rank":56,"authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Provides a listing of current committee members.","article_number":"5651483","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5651483","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5651483/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5651483/","publication_title":"2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","conference_dates":"25-26 Oct. 2010","publication_number":5638583,"is_number":5649053,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"25-26 Oct. 2010","start_page":"xi","end_page":"xi","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":82,"insert_date":"20101210","index_terms":{},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9488-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9487-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2010.5651429","title":"Cover image credits","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-9488-0","partnum":"10EX4986","rank":57,"authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Cover image credits.","article_number":"5651429","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5651429","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5651429/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5651429/","publication_title":"2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","conference_dates":"25-26 Oct. 2010","publication_number":5638583,"is_number":5649053,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"25-26 Oct. 2010","start_page":"1","end_page":"3","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":40,"insert_date":"20101210","index_terms":{},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9488-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9487-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2010.5651493","title":"IEEE Visualization and Graphics Technical Committee (VGTC)","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-9488-0","partnum":"10EX4986","rank":58,"authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Provides a listing of current committee members.","article_number":"5651493","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5651493","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5651493/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5651493/","publication_title":"2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","conference_dates":"25-26 Oct. 2010","publication_number":5638583,"is_number":5649053,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"25-26 Oct. 2010","start_page":"ix","end_page":"ix","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":57,"insert_date":"20101210","index_terms":{},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9488-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9487-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2010.5651504","title":"Preface Message from the conference and paper chairs","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-9488-0","partnum":"10EX4986","rank":59,"authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Presents the introductory welcome message from the conference proceedings.

While visual analytics started in the United States with a focus on security, it is now a worldwide research agenda with a broad range of application domains. This is evidenced by efforts like the European VisMaster program and the upcoming Visual Analytics and Knowledge Discovery (VAKD) workshop, just to name two. There are still questions concerning where and how visual analytics fits in the large body of research and applications represented by the VisWeek community. This panel will present distinct viewpoints on what visual analytics is and its role in understanding complex information in a complex world. The goal of this panel is to engender discussion from the audience on the emergence and continued advancement of visual analytics and its role relative to fields of related research. Four distinguished panelists will provide their perspective on visual analytics focusing on what it is, what it should be, and thoughts about a development path between these two states. The purpose of the presentations is not to give a critical review of the literature but rather to give a review on the field and to provide a contextual perspective based on the panelists' years of experience and accumulated knowledge. Each panelist will have at most 15 minutes to present their position in order to establish the context for the audience. The rest of the time will be open for questions. The panel organizer will oversee the panel and ensure there are numerous questions of the panelists. On August 6, 2010 this world lost Jim Thomas. His influence and impact on our community were clear and profound with conferences, funding programs, research groups, consortia, government agencies, and industry. Through his intellect, energy, and passion Jim was able to create an international movement and shape a new discipline — visual analytics. This discussion on the future of visual analytics is dedicated to Jim and his work. Jim will be greatly missed but his influence and passion will always be felt.","article_number":"5649078","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5649078","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5649078/","publication_title":"2010 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","conference_dates":"25-26 Oct. 2010","publication_number":5638583,"is_number":5649053,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"25-26 Oct. 2010","start_page":"257","end_page":"259","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1562,"insert_date":"20101210","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Data visualization","Data analysis","Analytical models","Computational modeling","Cognition","Human computer interaction"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9488-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9487-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2010.5652375","title":"In memoriam: Illuminating our paths — James (Jim) Joseph Thomas","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-9488-0","partnum":"10EX4986","rank":71,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, P.

One of the early attendees of these meetings was infected with this Drafa Fever virus and subsequently spread it to other attendees who then spread the disease in their respective countries upon returning home.
