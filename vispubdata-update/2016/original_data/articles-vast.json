Despite its ubiquity, the problem of presenting the recommendations of temporal event sequences has not been studied. We propose EventAction, which to our knowledge, is the first attempt at a prescriptive analytics interface designed to present and explain recommendations of temporal event sequences. EventAction provides a visual analytics approach to (1) identify similar records, (2) explore potential outcomes, (3) review recommended temporal event sequences that might help achieve the users' goals, and (4) interactively assist users as they define a personalized action plan associated with a probability of success. Following the design study framework, we designed and deployed EventAction in the context of student advising and reported on the evaluation with a student review manager and three graduate students.","article_number":"7883512","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7883512","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7883512/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7883512/","publication_title":"2016 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Baltimore, MD, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2016","publication_number":7867613,"is_number":7883493,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2016","start_page":"61","end_page":"70","citing_paper_count":46,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":1281,"insert_date":"20170323","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Recommender systems","Visual analytics","Medical services","History","Timing","Prototypes"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Temporal event sequences","recommender systems","prescriptive analytics","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Sequence Of Events","Visual Analysis","Temporal Sequence","Action Plan","Graduate Students","Review Manager","Recommender Systems","Review Recommendations","Temporal Sequence Of Events","Advice For Students","Student Consultants","Archive","Prototype","Number Of Students","Distribution Of Outcomes","Results Of Distribution","Assistant Professor","Visualization Techniques","Current Recordings","Iterative Refinement","Current Students","Computer Science Students","Event Categories","Use Of Color","Color Manipulation","Trust In Systems","Advanced Courses","Student Record","Goals For Students","Core Courses","Workflow","Collaborative Filtering"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5662-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5661-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2016.7883517","title":"DropoutSeer: Visualizing learning patterns in Massive Open Online Courses for dropout reasoning and prediction","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5090-5662-0","rank":2,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085871141","id":37085871141,"full_name":"Yuanzhe Chen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085471103","id":37085471103,"full_name":"Qing Chen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087681826","id":37087681826,"full_name":"Mingqian Zhao","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085638999","id":37085638999,"full_name":"Sebastien Boyer","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085648060","id":37085648060,"full_name":"Kalyan Veeramachaneni","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Aiming at massive participation and open access education, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have attracted millions of learners over the past few years. However, the high dropout rate of learners is considered to be one of the most crucial factors that may hinder the development of MOOCs. To tackle this problem, statistical models have been developed to predict dropout behavior based on learner activity logs. Although predictive models can foresee the dropout behavior, it is still difficult for users to understand the reasons behind the predicted results and further design interventions to prevent dropout. In addition, with a better understanding of dropout, researchers in the area of predictive modeling in turn can improve the models. In this paper, we introduce DropoutSeer, a visual analytics system which not only helps instructors and education experts understand the reasons for dropout, but also allows researchers to identify crucial features which can further improve the performance of the models. Both the heterogeneous data extracted from three different kinds of learner activity logs (i.e., clickstream, forum posts and assignment records) and the predicted results are visualized in the proposed system. Case studies and expert interviews have been conducted to demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of DropoutSeer.","article_number":"7883517","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7883517","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7883517/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7883517/","publication_title":"2016 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Baltimore, MD, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2016","publication_number":7867613,"is_number":7883493,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2016","start_page":"111","end_page":"120","citing_paper_count":39,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":1183,"insert_date":"20170323","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Predictive models","Data models","Feature extraction","Education","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization in education","machine learning","time series data","design studies"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Online Courses","Online Classes","Learning Patterns","Massive Open Online Courses","MOOCs","Prediction Model","Visual System","Dropout Rate","Expert Interviews","Reasons For Dropout","Forum Posts","Posts In Forums","Clickstream","Machine Learning","Decision Tree","Active Learning","End-users","Clustering Method","Clustering Results","Learning Behavior","Bar Charts","Domain Experts","Predictors Of Dropout","Group Learning","Visual Design","Visual Encoding","Stacked Bar Charts","End Of The Course","2D Feature","2D Character","Visualization Techniques","Design Guidelines","Number Of Videos"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5662-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5661-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2016.7883510","title":"D-Map: Visual analysis of ego-centric information diffusion patterns in social media","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5090-5662-0","rank":3,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085387892","id":37085387892,"full_name":"Siming Chen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086146756","id":37086146756,"full_name":"Shuai Chen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085375437","id":37085375437,"full_name":"Zhenhuang Wang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Faculty of Engineer and Information Technology, The University of Technology, Sydney, Australia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085343774","id":37085343774,"full_name":"Jie Liang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Faculty of Engineer and Information Technology, The University of Technology, Sydney, Australia"]}},{"affiliation":"Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403856700","id":37403856700,"full_name":"Xiaoru Yuan","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"New York University, Shanghai, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604309600","id":37604309600,"full_name":"Nan Cao","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University, Shanghai, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Southwest University of Science and Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37293504200","id":37293504200,"full_name":"Yadong Wu","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Southwest University of Science and Technology, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Popular social media platforms could rapidly propagate vital information over social networks among a significant number of people.

With additional interaction and linking, D-Map is capable of providing visual portraits of the influential users and describing their social behaviors. A comprehensive visual analysis system is developed to support interactive exploration with D-Map. We evaluate our work with real world social media data and find interesting patterns among users.

This is not surprising in the light of massive and still increasing amounts of available digitized texts. Websites, social media, news wire, and digital libraries are just few examples of the diverse text sources whose visual analysis and exploration offers new opportunities to effectively mine and manage the information and knowledge hidden within them. A popular visualization method for large text collections is to represent each document by a glyph in 2D space. These landscapes can be the result of optimizing pairwise distances in 2D to represent document similarities, or they are provided directly as meta data, such as geo-locations. For well-defined information needs, suitable interaction methods are available for these spatializations. However, free exploration and navigation on a level of abstraction between a labeled document spatialization and reading single documents is largely unsupported. As a result, vital foraging steps for task-tailored actions, such as selecting subgroups of documents for detailed inspection, or subsequent sense-making steps are hampered. To fill in this gap, we propose DocuCompass, a focus+context approach based on the lens metaphor. It comprises multiple methods to characterize local groups of documents, and to efficiently guide exploration based on users' requirements. DocuCompass thus allows for effective interactive exploration of document landscapes without disrupting the mental map of users by changing the layout itself. We discuss the suitability of multiple navigation and characterization methods for different spatializations and texts. Finally, we provide insights generated through user feedback and discuss the effectiveness of our approach.","article_number":"7883507","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7883507","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7883507/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7883507/","publication_title":"2016 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Baltimore, MD, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2016","publication_number":7867613,"is_number":7883493,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2016","start_page":"11","end_page":"20","citing_paper_count":26,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":996,"insert_date":"20170323","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Lenses","Visualization","Two dimensional displays","Layout","Metadata","Text analysis","Navigation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["interaction techniques","document visualization","text mining","visual analytics","focus+context"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Foraging","Metadata","Visual Analysis","Characterization Methods","User Feedback","Collection Of Texts","Free Exploration","Momentum In Recent Years","Heatmap","Visual Information","Visual Representation","Text Analysis","Straightforward Way","Cloud Data","Word Cloud","Need For Information","Topic Modeling","Study Sessions","Additional Cues","Latent Dirichlet Allocation","Text Types","Exploration Task","Interaction Techniques","Text Extraction","Text Labels","Multiple Lenses","Multiple Lens","Software Prototype","Prototyping Process","Text Dataset","Text Data Sets","Extraction Task"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5662-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5661-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2016.7883519","title":"The semantics of sketch: Flexibility in visual query systems for time series data","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5090-5662-0","rank":5,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Washington","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38230607000","id":38230607000,"full_name":"Michael Correll","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Washington"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Wisconsin-Madison","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282585700","id":37282585700,"full_name":"Michael Gleicher","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Wisconsin-Madison"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Sketching allows analysts to specify complex and free-form patterns of interest. Visual query systems can make use of sketches to locate these patterns of interest in large datasets. However, sketching is ambiguous: the same drawing could represent a multitude of potential queries. In this work, we investigate these ambiguities as they apply to visual query systems for time series data. We define a class of “invariants” - the properties of a time series that the analyst wishes to ignore when performing a sketch-based query. We present the results of a crowd-sourced study, showing that these invariants are key components of how people rate the strength of match between sketch and target. We adapt a number of algorithms for time series matching to support invariants in sketches. Lastly, we present a web-deployed prototype sketch-based visual query system that relies on these invariants. We apply the prototype to data from finance, the digital humanities, and political science.","article_number":"7883519","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7883519","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7883519/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7883519/","publication_title":"2016 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Baltimore, MD, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2016","publication_number":7867613,"is_number":7883493,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2016","start_page":"131","end_page":"140","citing_paper_count":25,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":721,"insert_date":"20170323","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Time series analysis","Prototypes","Shape","Semantics","Algorithm design and analysis","Signal processing algorithms"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Time Series","Semantic","Time Series Data","Query System","Visual Query","Visual System","Interesting Patterns","Pattern Of Involvement","Properties Of Series","Digital Humanities","Digital Humanitarianism","Mean Square Error","Mean Square Deviation","Similarity Measure","Similarity Metrics","Additive Noise","Additive White Gaussian Noise","Vertical Position","Vertical Location","Square Wave","Mental Models","Variety Of Domains","Diverse Domains","Matching Algorithm","Multiple Algorithms","Time Series Dataset","Query Language","Dynamic Time Warping","Series Of Datasets","Hough Transform","Hough Space","Factorial Invariance","Victorian Era","Victorian England","Victorian Britain","Victorian Period","Victorian Age","Victorian Society","Partial Match","Time Warping","Potential Matches","Prototype Tool","Interaction Techniques"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5662-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5661-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2016.7883511","title":"How ideas flow across multiple social groups","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5090-5662-0","rank":6,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Software, Tsinghua University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085460249","id":37085460249,"full_name":"Xiting Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Software, Tsinghua University"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Software, Tsinghua University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406039100","id":37406039100,"full_name":"Shixia Liu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Software, Tsinghua University"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Software, Tsinghua University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087502906","id":37087502906,"full_name":"Yang Chen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Software, Tsinghua University"]}},{"affiliation":"Michigan State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077240400","id":37077240400,"full_name":"Tai-Quan Peng","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Michigan State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Tsinghua University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086047572","id":37086047572,"full_name":"Jing Su","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tsinghua University"]}},{"affiliation":"UNCC","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37292632600","id":37292632600,"full_name":"Jing Yang","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UNCC"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275929500","id":37275929500,"full_name":"Baining Guo","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Tracking how correlated ideas flow within and across multiple social groups facilitates the understanding of the transfer of information, opinions, and thoughts on social media.

To convey complex lead-lag relationships over time, IdeaFlow combines the strengths of a bubble tree, a flow map, and a timeline.

A correlated-clustering-based layout algorithm is used to simultaneously generate multiple flow maps with less ambiguity.

They may forget what they have done, are unaware of where they are in the context of the overall task, and are unsure where to continue. In this paper, we introduce a tool, SenseMap, to address these issues in the context of browser-based online sensemaking. We conducted a semi-structured interview with nine participants to explore their behaviors in online sensemaking with existing browser functionality. A simplified sensemaking model based on Pirolli and Card's model is derived to better represent the behaviors we found: users iteratively collect information sources relevant to the task, curate them in a way that makes sense, and finally communicate their findings to others. SenseMap automatically captures provenance of user sensemaking actions and provides multi-linked views to visualize the collected information and enable users to curate and communicate their findings. To explore how SenseMap is used, we conducted a user study in a naturalistic work setting with five participants completing the same sensemaking task related to their daily work activities. All participants found the visual representation and interaction of the tool intuitive to use. Three of them engaged with the tool and produced successful outcomes. It helped them to organize information sources, to quickly find and navigate to the sources they wanted, and to effectively communicate their findings.","article_number":"7883515","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7883515","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7883515/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7883515/","publication_title":"2016 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Baltimore, MD, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2016","publication_number":7867613,"is_number":7883493,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2016","start_page":"91","end_page":"100","citing_paper_count":20,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":662,"insert_date":"20170323","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Browsers","History","Interviews","Visualization","Data visualization","Conferences","Web pages"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Sensemaking","browser-based online sensemaking","analytic provenance","visual analytics","visualization","design study"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Source Of Information","Visual Representation","Period Of Exploration","Semantic","Iterative Process","Natural Settings","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Temporal Information","Web Page","Spatial Organization","User Behavior","Qualitative Features","Qualitative Characteristics","Overview Of Process","Series Of Workshops","Forms Of Reasoning","Knowledge Map","Knowledge Captured","Sense-making Process","Different Levels Of Detail","Standard Web Browser","Node Mapping","Lymph Node Mapping","Browser Views","Location-aware","Design Workshops"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5662-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5661-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2016.7883506","title":"Supporting visual exploration for multiple users in large display environments","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5090-5662-0","rank":8,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085388100","id":37085388100,"full_name":"Sriram Karthik Badam","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37701811900","id":37701811900,"full_name":"Fereshteh Amini","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295438200","id":37295438200,"full_name":"Niklas Elmqvist","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283481700","id":37283481700,"full_name":"Pourang Irani","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"We present a design space exploration of interaction techniques for supporting multiple collaborators exploring data on a shared large display. Our proposed solution is based on users controlling individual lenses using both explicit gestures as well as proxemics: the spatial relations between people and physical artifacts such as their distance, orientation, and movement. We discuss different design considerations for implicit and explicit interactions through the lens, and evaluate the user experience to find a balance between the implicit and explicit interaction styles. Our findings indicate that users favor implicit interaction through proxemics for navigation and collaboration, but prefer using explicit mid-air gestures to perform actions that are perceived to be direct, such as terminating a lens composition. Based on these results, we propose a hybrid technique utilizing both proxemics and mid-air gestures, along with examples applying this technique to other datasets. Finally, we performed a usability evaluation of the hybrid technique and observed user performance improvements in the presence of both implicit and explicit interaction styles.","article_number":"7883506","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7883506","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7883506/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7883506/","publication_title":"2016 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Baltimore, MD, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2016","publication_number":7867613,"is_number":7883493,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2016","start_page":"1","end_page":"10","citing_paper_count":19,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":811,"insert_date":"20170323","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Lenses","Collaboration","Navigation","Aerospace electronics","Computers","Mice"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Proxemics","gestures","visual exploration","collaborative sensemaking","user study","large displays","orientation","position"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["User Experience","Design Space","Proxemics","Body In Space","Visual Code","Hybrid Technique","User Control","Interaction Styles","Interaction Techniques","Explicit Interactions","Design Space Exploration","Present Improvements","Interaction Model","Computer System","Physical Space","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Mode Of Interaction","System Architecture","Formal Evaluation","Physical Effort","User Feedback","Client-side","2-tier","Gesture Recognition","Explicit Action","Merge Operation","Collaborative Analysis","Summative Evaluation","Likert Scale Questionnaire","Smart Environment","Hybrid Version","Media Player","Lens Design","Design Of Lenses"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5662-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5661-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2016.7883520","title":"Visual analysis and coding of data-rich user behavior","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5090-5662-0","rank":9,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085671312","id":37085671312,"full_name":"Tanja Blascheck","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586060300","id":37586060300,"full_name":"Fabian Beck","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Trier, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085486113","id":37085486113,"full_name":"Sebastian Baltes","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Trier, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268023800","id":37268023800,"full_name":"Thomas Ertl","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268045000","id":37268045000,"full_name":"Daniel Weiskopf","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Investigating user behavior involves abstracting low-level events to higher-level concepts.

An analyst assigns codes, grouped into code categories, as part of an interactive process. Filtering and searching helps to select specific activities and focus an analysis. A comparison visualization summarizes results of coding and reveals relationships between codes. Editing features support efficient assignment, refinement, and aggregation of codes.

The presented tool consists of two modules: the computation module and the analysis module. The computation module enables a convenient setup and execution of distributed off-line-computations on industrial 3D X-ray computed tomography datasets. It allows the user to assemble individual segmentation pipelines in the form of single pipeline steps, and to specify the parameter ranges as well as the sampling of the parameter-space of each pipeline segment. The result of a single segmentation run consists of the input parameters, the calculated 3D binary-segmentation mask, the resulting porosity value, and other derived results (e.g., segmentation pipeline run-time). The analysis module presents the data at different levels of detail by drill-down filtering in order to determine accurate and robust segmentation pipelines. Overview visualizations allow to initially compare and evaluate the segmentation pipelines. With a scatter plot matrix (SPLOM), the segmentation pipelines are examined in more detail based on their input and output parameters. Individual segmentation-pipeline runs are selected in the SPLOM and visually examined and compared in 2D slice views and 3D renderings by using aggregated segmentation masks and statistical contour renderings. PorosityAnalyzer has been thoroughly evaluated with the help of twelve domain experts. Two case studies demonstrate the applicability of our proposed concepts and visualization techniques, and show that our tool helps domain experts to gain new insights and improve their workflow efficiency.","article_number":"7883516","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7883516","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7883516/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7883516/","publication_title":"2016 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Baltimore, MD, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2016","publication_number":7867613,"is_number":7883493,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2016","start_page":"101","end_page":"110","citing_paper_count":11,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":495,"insert_date":"20170323","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Pipelines","Visualization","Data visualization","Image segmentation","Three-dimensional displays","Electronic mail","Analytical models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["I.3.6 [Computer Graphics]: Methodology and Techniques—Interaction techniques"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Fiber-reinforced Polymer","Segmentation Pipeline","Evaluation Pipeline","Scatter Plot","Input Parameters","Visual Examination","Visual Test","Analysis Module","Domain Experts","Output Parameters","Yield Parameters","Image Synthesis","Rendering Engine","3D Renderings","X-ray Computed Tomography","Porosity Values","Calculation Module","Computation Module","Scatterplot Matrix","Scatterplot Matrices","Histogram","Boxplots","Visualization Tool","Segmentation Method","Carbon Fiber","Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer","Reference Segmentation","Visual Analysis Of Data","Multidimensional Data","Multidimensional Analysis","Segmentation Algorithm","Segmentation Results","Otsu Thresholding","Binary Threshold","Dice Similarity Coefficient","Dice Coefficient","Trade-off Analysis","Low Porosity"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5662-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5661-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2016.7883513","title":"SocialBrands: Visual analysis of public perceptions of brands on social media","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5090-5662-0","rank":11,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Visa Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38528018400","id":38528018400,"full_name":"Xiaotong Liu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visa Research"]}},{"affiliation":"IBM Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086030660","id":37086030660,"full_name":"Anbang Xu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IBM Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Ohio State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37075500200","id":37075500200,"full_name":"Liang Gou","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Ohio State University"]}},{"affiliation":"IBM Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086038298","id":37086038298,"full_name":"Haibin Liu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IBM Research"]}},{"affiliation":"IBM Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283362000","id":37283362000,"full_name":"Rama Akkiraju","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IBM Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Visa Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279493500","id":37279493500,"full_name":"Han-Wei Shen","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visa Research"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Public perceptions of a brand is critical to its performance.

In this paper, we present SocialBrands, a novel visual analysis tool for brand managers to understand public perceptions of brands on social media. Social-Brands leverages brand personality framework in marketing literature and social computing approaches to compute the personality of brands from three driving factors (user imagery, employee imagery, and official announcement) on social media, and construct an evidence network explaining the association between brand personality and driving factors. These computational results are then integrated with new interactive visualizations to help brand managers understand personality traits and their driving factors. We demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of SocialBrands through a series of user studies with brand managers in an enterprise context.

Often the analytical task in such data is to identify specific patterns, but this is a very complex and computationally difficult problem and so focusing the search in order to only identify interesting patterns is a common solution. We propose an efficient method for exploring user-sketched patterns, incorporating the domain expert's knowledge, in time series data through a shape grammar based approach. The shape grammar is extracted from the time series by considering the data as a combination of basic elementary shapes positioned across different amplitudes. We represent these basic shapes using a ratio value, perform binning on ratio values and apply a symbolic approximation. Our proposed method for pattern matching is amplitude-, scale- and translation-invariant and, since the pattern search and pattern constraint relaxation happen at the symbolic level, is very efficient permitting its use in a real-time/online system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in a case study on stock market data although it is applicable to any numeric time series data.","article_number":"7883518","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7883518","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7883518/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7883518/","publication_title":"2016 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Baltimore, MD, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2016","publication_number":7867613,"is_number":7883493,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2016","start_page":"121","end_page":"130","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":471,"insert_date":"20170323","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Time series analysis","Shape","Grammar","Pattern matching","Search problems","Approximation algorithms","Market research"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["User-queries","Sketching","Time Series","Symbolic approximation","Regular Expression","Shape Grammar"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Time Series","Pattern Matching","Shape Grammar","Interactive","Time Series Data","Stock Market","Interesting Patterns","Pattern Of Involvement","Translation Invariance","Translational Symmetry","Pattern Search","Relaxed Constraints","Basic Shape","Stock Market Data","Raw Data","Building Blocks","Patterns In Data","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Trends Data","Data Streams","Scale-invariant","User Input","Gradient Ratio","Regular Expressions","Regex","Set Of Shapes","Soft Constraints","Symbolic Space","Approximate Level","Local Trends","Financial Domain","Trends In Patterns","Sufficient Care"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5662-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5661-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2016.7883514","title":"DimScanner: A relation-based visual exploration approach towards data dimension inspection","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5090-5662-0","rank":13,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087282371","id":37087282371,"full_name":"Jing Xia","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087180120","id":37087180120,"full_name":"Wei Chen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087564256","id":37087564256,"full_name":"Yumeng Hou","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087567437","id":37087567437,"full_name":"Wanqi Hu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087568256","id":37087568256,"full_name":"Xinxin Huang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University System, West Lafayette, IN, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087565952","id":37087565952,"full_name":"David S.

Various dimension relation inspection tools and dimension exploration tools have been proposed for efficient data examining and understanding. However, the needed workload varies largely with respect to data complexity and user expertise, which can only be reduced with rich background knowledge over the data. In this paper we address the workload challenge with a data structuring and exploration scheme that affords dimension relation detection and that serves as the background knowledge for further investigation. We contribute a novel data structuring scheme that leverages an information-theoretic view structuring algorithm to uncover information-aware relations among different data views, and thereby discloses redundancy and other relation patterns among dimensions. The integrated system, DimScanner, empowers analysts with rich user controls and assistance widgets to interactively detect the relations of multi-dimensional data.","article_number":"7883514","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7883514","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7883514/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7883514/","publication_title":"2016 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Baltimore, MD","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2016","publication_number":7867613,"is_number":7883493,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2016","start_page":"81","end_page":"90","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":528,"insert_date":"20170323","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Measurement","Two dimensional displays","Correlation","Layout","Visualization","Inspection"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["High-dimensional data visualization","information-aware relation","data exploration"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Dimensional Data","Data Structure","Exploratory Data","Multidimensional Data","Multidimensional Analysis","Close Relationship","Structural Components","Dimensional Space","Multidimensional Space","Mutual Information","Direct Control","Multivariate Data","Multivariate Statistics","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Relationship Matrix","Relationship Matrices","Kinship Matrix","Tree Structure","Data Space","Quality Metrics","System Scale","2D Plane","Null Value","Relational View","Conditional Entropy","2D Views","Parallel Coordinates","Dimensions Of Categories","Categories For Each Dimension","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Line Chart","Leaf Node","Latitude","Latitudinal","User Profile","Numerous Properties","Numerous Attributes","Numerous Dimensions","Exploration Process"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5662-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5661-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2016.7883508","title":"C2A: Crowd consensus analytics for virtual colonoscopy","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5090-5662-0","rank":14,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085387879","id":37085387879,"full_name":"Ji Hwan Park","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Stony Brook University"]}},{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085891693","id":37085891693,"full_name":"Saad Nadeem","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Stony Brook University"]}},{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085396011","id":37085396011,"full_name":"Seyedkoosha Mirhosseini","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Stony Brook University"]}},{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268052800","id":37268052800,"full_name":"Arie Kaufman","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Stony Brook University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"We present a medical crowdsourcing visual analytics platform called C2A to visualize, classify and filter crowdsourced clinical data. More specifically, C2A is used to build consensus on a clinical diagnosis by visualizing crowd responses and filtering out anomalous activity. Crowdsourcing medical applications have recently shown promise where the non-expert users (the crowd) were able to achieve accuracy similar to the medical experts. This has the potential to reduce interpretation/reading time and possibly improve accuracy by building a consensus on the findings beforehand and letting the medical experts make the final diagnosis. In this paper, we focus on a virtual colonoscopy (VC) application with the clinical technicians as our target users, and the radiologists acting as consultants and classifying segments as benign or malignant. In particular, C2A is used to analyze and explore crowd responses on video segments, created from fly-throughs in the virtual colon. C2A provides several interactive visualization components to build crowd consensus on video segments, to detect anomalies in the crowd data and in the VC video segments, and finally, to improve the non-expert user's work quality and performance by A/B testing for the optimal crowdsourcing platform and application-specific parameters. Case studies and domain experts feedback demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in improving workers' output quality, the potential to reduce the radiologists' interpretation time, and hence, the potential to improve the traditional clinical workflow by marking the majority of the video segments as benign based on the crowd consensus.","article_number":"7883508","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7883508","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7883508/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7883508/","publication_title":"2016 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Baltimore, MD, USA","conference_dates":"23-28 Oct. 2016","publication_number":7867613,"is_number":7883493,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"23-28 Oct. 2016","start_page":"21","end_page":"30","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":295,"insert_date":"20170323","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Crowdsourcing","Colon","Visual analytics","Hospitals","Virtual colonoscopy","Medical diagnostic imaging"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Crowdsourcing","virtual colonoscopy","visual analytics","biomedical applications"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Virtual Colonoscopy","Crowd Consensus","Medical Applications","Analysis Platform","Medical Experts","User Performance","Video Segments","Major Segments","Non-expert Users","False Negative","Local Information","Types Of Information","Low Speed","Cloud Data","Word Cloud","Video Data","Similar Views","Lung Nodules","Solitary Pulmonary Nodules","Depth Perception","Depth Cues","User Responses","Number Of Polyps","User Accuracy","Polyp Detection","Ground Segment","User Segments","Expert Radiologists","Current Video","Main View","Consensus Rating","Consensus Evaluation","Consensus View","Consensual View","Standard View"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5662-0","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5661-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2016.7883509","title":"The DataSpace for HIV vaccine studies","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5090-5662-0","rank":15,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Artefact","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087538490","id":37087538490,"full_name":"David McColgin","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Artefact"]}},{"affiliation":"Artefact","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086006520","id":37086006520,"full_name":"Paul Hoover","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Artefact"]}},{"affiliation":"Independent","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086015221","id":37086015221,"full_name":"Mark Igra","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Independent"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"The DataSpace for HIV vaccine studies is a discovery tool available on the web to hundreds of investigators.
