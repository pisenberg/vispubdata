Vega-Lite combines a traditional grammar of graphics, providing visual encoding rules and a composition algebra for layered and multi-view displays, with a novel grammar of interaction. Users specify interactive semantics by composing selections. In Vega-Lite, a selection is an abstraction that defines input event processing, points of interest, and a predicate function for inclusion testing. Selections parameterize visual encodings by serving as input data, defining scale extents, or by driving conditional logic. The Vega-Lite compiler automatically synthesizes requisite data flow and event handling logic, which users can override for further customization. In contrast to existing reactive specifications, Vega-Lite selections decompose an interaction design into concise, enumerable semantic units. We evaluate Vega-Lite through a range of examples, demonstrating succinct specification of both customized interaction methods and common techniques such as panning, zooming, and linked selection.","article_number":"7539624","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539624","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539624/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539624/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"341","end_page":"350","citing_paper_count":436,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":6043,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Grammar","Visualization","Encoding","Transforms","Brushes"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Information visualization","interaction","systems","toolkits","declarative specification"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interaction Graph","Grammar Of Graphics","Semantic","Data Visualization","Interactive Visualization","Range Of Examples","Visual Encoding","Input Events","Data Sources","Field Data","Parameter Space","Data Transformation","Disambiguation","Layering","Design Space","Color Channels","Voronoi Diagram","Voronoi Tessellation","Voronoi Cell","Visual Elements","Color Palette","Items Of Interest","Layer Operation","Scatterplot Matrix","Scatterplot Matrices","JavaScript Object Notation","Visual Channels","Interaction Techniques","Composite View","Composition Operator"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598831","title":"Towards Better Analysis of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":2,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Software and TNList, Tsinghua University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077049000","id":37077049000,"full_name":"Mengchen Liu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Software and TNList, Tsinghua University"]}},{"affiliation":"Dept. of Comp.

However, the development of high-quality deep models typically relies on a substantial amount of trial-and-error, as there is still no clear understanding of when and why a deep model works. In this paper, we present a visual analytics approach for better understanding, diagnosing, and refining deep CNNs. We formulate a deep CNN as a directed acyclic graph. Based on this formulation, a hybrid visualization is developed to disclose the multiple facets of each neuron and the interactions between them. In particular, we introduce a hierarchical rectangle packing algorithm and a matrix reordering algorithm to show the derived features of a neuron cluster. We also propose a biclustering-based edge bundling method to reduce visual clutter caused by a large number of connections between neurons. We evaluated our method on a set of CNNs and the results are generally favorable.","article_number":"7536654","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7536654","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536654/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536654/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"91","end_page":"100","citing_paper_count":330,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":7766,"insert_date":"20160809","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Neurons","Neural networks","Training","Visual analytics","Clustering algorithms","Image edge detection"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Deep convolutional neural networks","rectangle packing","matrix reordering","edge bundling","biclustering"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Neural Network","Convolutional Neural Network","Deep Convolutional Neural Network","Deep Models","Image Classification","Multiple Aspects","Multiple Facets","Directed Acyclic Graph","Neuronal Clusters","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Pattern Recognition Tasks","Deep Learning","Neuronal Activity","Convolutional Layers","Output Layer","Recurrent Neural Network","Feature Learning","Lower Layer","Neurons In Layer","Basic Convolutional Neural Network","Convolutional Neural Network-based","Thousands Of Neurons","Role Of Neurons","Image Patches","Average Activity","Negative Weights","Team Of Experts","Adjacent Layers","Different Types Of Images","Negative Edges"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598838","title":"Visualizing the Hidden Activity of Artificial Neural Networks","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":3,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Groningen, University of Campinas","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085833475","id":37085833475,"full_name":"Paulo E.

Artificial neural networks currently achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. Although such networks are typically used as black-boxes, they are also widely believed to learn (high-dimensional) higher-level representations of the original observations. In this paper, we propose using dimensionality reduction for two tasks: visualizing the relationships between learned representations of observations, and visualizing the relationships between artificial neurons. Through experiments conducted in three traditional image classification benchmark datasets, we show how visualization can provide highly valuable feedback for network designers. For instance, our discoveries in one of these datasets (SVHN) include the presence of interpretable clusters of learned representations, and the partitioning of artificial neurons into groups with apparently related discriminative roles.","article_number":"7539329","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539329","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539329/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539329/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"101","end_page":"110","citing_paper_count":195,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":5987,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Neurons","Visualization","Data visualization","Training","Neural networks","Computational modeling","Benchmark testing"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Artificial neural networks","dimensionality reduction","algorithm understanding"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Neural Network","Artificial Neural Network","Neural Network Model","Machine Learning","Dimensionality Reduction","Benchmark Datasets","Representation Learning","Pattern Classification","Results Of Task","Task Outcome","Representative Observations","Convolutional Neural Network","Neuronal Activity","Digital Images","Convolutional Layers","Low Accuracy","Hidden Layer","Mental Representations","Internal Representation","Active Layer","Neurons In Layer","Multilayer Perceptron","Visual Feedback","Video Feedback","Clustering Visualization","Projection Neurons","MNIST Dataset","Test Subset","Visual Approach","Visualization Of Relationships","Development Of Representations","Evolution Of Representations","Background Light","Alternative Representation","High Degree Of Control"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598495","title":"Visual Interaction with Dimensionality Reduction: A Structured Literature Analysis","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":4,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085566394","id":37085566394,"full_name":"Dominik Sacha","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Middlesex University, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406066900","id":37406066900,"full_name":"Leishi Zhang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Middlesex University, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590945600","id":37590945600,"full_name":"Michael Sedlmair","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"SSS, Belgian F.R.S.-FNRS.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37676969200","id":37676969200,"full_name":"John A.

For DR techniques to be useful in exploratory data analysis, they need to be adapted to human needs and domain-specific problems, ideally, interactively, and on-the-fly. Many visual analytics systems have already demonstrated the benefits of tightly integrating DR with interactive visualizations. Nevertheless, a general, structured understanding of this integration is missing. To address this, we systematically studied the visual analytics and visualization literature to investigate how analysts interact with automatic DR techniques. The results reveal seven common interaction scenarios that are amenable to interactive control such as specifying algorithmic constraints, selecting relevant features, or choosing among several DR algorithms. We investigate specific implementations of visual analysis systems integrating DR, and analyze ways that other machine learning methods have been combined with DR. Summarizing the results in a “human in the loop” process model provides a general lens for the evaluation of visual interactive DR systems. We apply the proposed model to study and classify several systems previously described in the literature, and to derive future research opportunities.","article_number":"7536217","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7536217","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536217/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536217/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"241","end_page":"250","citing_paper_count":154,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":4185,"insert_date":"20160808","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Algorithm design and analysis","Data models","Manuals","Machine learning algorithms","Analytical models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Interactive visualization","machine learning","visual analytics","dimensionality reduction"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Dimensionality Reduction","Machine Learning","Analysis System","Process Model","Machine Learning Methods","Interactive System","Multidimensional Data","Multidimensional Analysis","Interactive Visualization","Interaction Scenarios","Human-in-the-loop","Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms","Quality Measures","Feature Space","Linear Discriminant Analysis","Discriminant Function","Discriminant Function Analysis","Class Labels","Direct Use","Direct Utilization","Direct Manipulation","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Independent Component Analysis","Relevant Papers","Projection Matrix","Matrix Operations","Projection Matrices","Set Of Papers","Dimensionality Reduction Methods","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Interaction Techniques","Interaction Paradigm","Projection Views","Canonical Correlation Analysis","Self-organizing Map","Kohonen","Cluster Labels","Linear Projection"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598468","title":"Characterizing Guidance in Visual Analytics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":5,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Vienna University of Technology, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085791019","id":37085791019,"full_name":"Davide Ceneda","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Vienna University of Technology, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Vienna University of Technology, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37847052600","id":37847052600,"full_name":"Theresia Gschwandtner","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Vienna University of Technology, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer IGD, Darmstadt, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37603783600","id":37603783600,"full_name":"Thorsten May","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer IGD, Darmstadt, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Vienna University of Technology, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282584500","id":37282584500,"full_name":"Silvia Miksch","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Vienna University of Technology, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Rostock, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37408482600","id":37408482600,"full_name":"Hans-Jörg Schulz","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Rostock, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403918900","id":37403918900,"full_name":"Marc Streit","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Rostock, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283236000","id":37283236000,"full_name":"Christian Tominski","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Rostock, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Visual analytics (VA) is typically applied in scenarios where complex data has to be analyzed. Unfortunately, there is a natural correlation between the complexity of the data and the complexity of the tools to study them. An adverse effect of complicated tools is that analytical goals are more difficult to reach. Therefore, it makes sense to consider methods that guide or assist users in the visual analysis process. Several such methods already exist in the literature, yet we are lacking a general model that facilitates in-depth reasoning about guidance. We establish such a model by extending van Wijk's model of visualization with the fundamental components of guidance. Guidance is defined as a process that gradually narrows the gap that hinders effective continuation of the data analysis. We describe diverse inputs based on which guidance can be generated and discuss different degrees of guidance and means to incorporate guidance into VA tools. We use existing guidance approaches from the literature to illustrate the various aspects of our model. As a conclusion, we identify research challenges and suggest directions for future studies. With our work we take a necessary step to pave the way to a systematic development of guidance techniques that effectively support users in the context of VA.","article_number":"7534883","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7534883","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7534883/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7534883/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"111","end_page":"120","citing_paper_count":146,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":3130,"insert_date":"20160805","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Context modeling","Context","Automobiles","Visual analytics","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","guidance model","assistance","user support"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Technical Guidance","Van Wijk","Visual Analytics Tool","Source Of Information","Analytical Methods","Knowledge Gaps","Parameter Space","Visual Representation","Visual Cues","Exploratory Data","Shortest Path","Partial Data","Visual Methods","Model Domain","Previous Activity","Visualization Techniques","User Requirements","Sequential Task","User Need","User Performance","Mental Maps","Guidance System","Workflow"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598608","title":"Embedded Data Representations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":6,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945380800","id":37945380800,"full_name":"Wesley Willett","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Copenhagen","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37076983200","id":37076983200,"full_name":"Yvonne Jansen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Copenhagen"]}},{"affiliation":"Inria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590932700","id":37590932700,"full_name":"Pierre Dragicevic","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Inria"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We introduce embedded data representations, the use of visual and physical representations of data that are deeply integrated with the physical spaces, objects, and entities to which the data refers.

While researchers and artists have already begun to create embedded data representations, the benefits, trade-offs, and even the language necessary to describe and compare these approaches remain unexplored. In this paper, we formalize the notion of physical data referents - the real-world entities and spaces to which data corresponds - and examine the relationship between referents and the visual and physical representations of their data. We differentiate situated representations, which display data in proximity to data referents, and embedded representations, which display data so that it spatially coincides with data referents. Drawing on examples from visualization, ubiquitous computing, and art, we explore the role of spatial indirection, scale, and interaction for embedded representations. We also examine the tradeoffs between non-situated, situated, and embedded data displays, including both visualizations and physicalizations.

Our controlled study shows that practitioners can assess performance significantly faster and more accurately with Squares than a confusion matrix, a common performance analysis tool in machine learning.","article_number":"7539404","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539404","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539404/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539404/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"61","end_page":"70","citing_paper_count":131,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2915,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Performance analysis","Data models","Debugging","Analytical models","Data visualization","Measurement","Visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Performance analysis","classification","usable machine learning"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Multi-label","Multi-class Classification","Multi-label Classification","Machine Learning","Control Study","Performance Metrics","Classification Problem","Confusion Matrix","Confusion Matrices","Common Tool","Common Metrics","False Positive","False Negative","High Scores","Support Vector Machine","Binary Classification","Prediction Score","Size Classes","Precision And Recall","Random Forest Model","Time Task","Correct Predictions","Support Vector Machine Model","Interactive Visualization","Debugging","Number Of Boxes","Parallel Coordinates","Solid Box","High Prediction Scores","Aggregate Value","Handwritten Digits","True Positive","Separation Performance"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598432","title":"SmartAdP: Visual Analytics of Large-scale Taxi Trajectories for Selecting Billboard Locations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":8,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088559342","id":37088559342,"full_name":"Dongyu Liu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhejiang University, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085887051","id":37085887051,"full_name":"Di Weng","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Macau","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086863152","id":37086863152,"full_name":"Yuhong Li","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Macau"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085887993","id":37085887993,"full_name":"Jie Bao","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37600606700","id":37600606700,"full_name":"Yu Zheng","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","id":37407308300,"full_name":"Yingcai Wu","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The problem of formulating solutions immediately and comparing them rapidly for billboard placements has plagued advertising planners for a long time, owing to the lack of efficient tools for in-depth analyses to make informed decisions.

In particular, we present SmartAdP, an interactive visual analytics system that deals with the two major challenges including finding good solutions in a huge solution space and comparing the solutions in a visual and intuitive manner. An interactive framework that integrates a novel visualization-driven data mining model enables advertising planners to effectively and efficiently formulate good candidate solutions. In addition, we propose a set of coupled visualizations: a solution view with metaphor-based glyphs to visualize the correlation between different solutions; a location view to display billboard locations in a compact manner; and a ranking view to present multi-typed rankings of the solutions. This system has been demonstrated using case studies with a real-world dataset and domain-expert interviews. Our approach can be adapted for other location selection problems such as selecting locations of retail stores or restaurants using trajectory data.","article_number":"7534856","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7534856","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7534856/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7534856/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"1","end_page":"10","citing_paper_count":131,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":5179,"insert_date":"20160805","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Trajectory","Data visualization","Public transportation","Advertising","Visual analytics","Data mining"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["optimal billboard locations","taxi trajectory","visual analytics","comparative analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Taxi Trajectory","In-depth Analysis","Data Mining","Interactive System","Solution Space","Domain Experts","Selection Problem","Visualization Techniques","Interactive Visualization","Candidate Solutions","Trajectory Data","Mining Models","Multiple Dimensions","Multiple Attributes","Multiple Properties","Average Speed","Target Area","Visual Comparison","Road Network","Street Network","Optimal Position","Optimal Location","Traffic Flow","Vehicular Traffic","Traffic Speed","Multiple Solutions","Target Trajectory","Road Segments","Street Segments","Traffic Volume","Traffic Intensity","Rank Solution","Value For Money","Interactive Visualization Tool","Different Levels Of Detail","Point Of Interest Data","Global Area"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2599107","title":"Immersive Collaborative Analysis of Network Connectivity: CAVE-style or Head-Mounted Display?","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":9,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Monash University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085649401","id":37085649401,"full_name":"Maxime Cordeil","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37326161000","id":37326161000,"full_name":"Tim Dwyer","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085462754","id":37085462754,"full_name":"Karsten Klein","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University"]}},{"affiliation":"Stanford University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37400143500","id":37400143500,"full_name":"Bireswar Laha","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Stanford University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37354163600","id":37354163600,"full_name":"Kim Marriott","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University"]}},{"affiliation":"University of South Australia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267424800","id":37267424800,"full_name":"Bruce H.

These devices potentially represent an affordable alternative to the more traditional, centralised CAVE-style immersive environments. One driver for the development of CAVE-style immersive environments has been collaborative sense-making. Despite this, there has been little research on the effectiveness of collaborative visualisation in CAVE-style facilities, especially with respect to abstract data visualisation tasks. Indeed, very few studies have focused on the use of these displays to explore and analyse abstract data such as networks and there have been no formal user studies investigating collaborative visualisation of abstract data in immersive environments. In this paper we present the results of the first such study. It explores the relative merits of HMD and CAVE-style immersive environments for collaborative analysis of network connectivity, a common and important task involving abstract data. We find significant differences between the two conditions in task completion time and the physical movements of the participants within the space: participants using the HMD were faster while the CAVE2 condition introduced an asymmetry in movement between collaborators. Otherwise, affordances for collaborative data analysis offered by the low-cost HMD condition were not found to be different for accuracy and communication with the CAVE2. These results are notable, given that the latest HMDs will soon be accessible (in terms of cost and potentially ubiquity) to a massive audience.","article_number":"7539620","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539620","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539620/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539620/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"441","end_page":"450","citing_paper_count":130,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":3680,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Collaboration","Data visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Visualization","Two dimensional displays","Virtual reality","Navigation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Oculus Rift","CAVE","Immersive Analytics","Collaboration","3D Network"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Connectivity Analysis","Conjunction Analysis","Head-mounted Display","Collaborative Analysis","Data Visualization","Completion Time","Visual Task","Physical Movement","Immersive Environment","Collaborative Data","Task Completion Time","Oculus Rift","Field Of View","User Experience","Shortest Path","Head Movements","3D Network","Vertical Movement","3D Visualization","Divide-and-conquer","Divide-and-rule","Oral Communication","Virtual Reality Platform","Collaborative Tasks","Head Tracking","Leap Motion","Hand Tracking","Finger Tracking","Average Completion Time","Ease Of Communication","Center Of The Room","Virtual Reality Setup","Virtual Reality Apparatus","Immersive Virtual Reality"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2599041","title":"OSPRay - A CPU Ray Tracing Framework for Scientific Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":10,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Intel Corp","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282958300","id":37282958300,"full_name":"I Wald","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Intel Corp"]}},{"affiliation":"Intel Corp","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37269399700","id":37269399700,"full_name":"GP Johnson","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Intel Corp"]}},{"affiliation":"Intel Corp","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085899338","id":37085899338,"full_name":"J Amstutz","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Intel Corp"]}},{"affiliation":"Texas Advanced Computing Center","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37408357200","id":37408357200,"full_name":"C Brownlee","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Texas Advanced Computing Center","Intel Corp"]}},{"affiliation":"Argonne National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37692671900","id":37692671900,"full_name":"A Knoll","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Argonne National Laboratory","SCI Insitute, University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"Intel Corp","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085904554","id":37085904554,"full_name":"J Jeffers","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Intel Corp"]}},{"affiliation":"Intel Corp","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37708237500","id":37708237500,"full_name":"J Günther","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Intel Corp"]}},{"affiliation":"Texas Advanced Computing Center","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37990427800","id":37990427800,"full_name":"P Navratil","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Texas Advanced Computing Center"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Scientific data is continually increasing in complexity, variety and size, making efficient visualization and specifically rendering an ongoing challenge.

Colorgorical uses iterative semi-random sampling to pick colors from CIELAB space based on user-defined discriminability and preference importances. Colors are selected by assigning each a weighted sum score that applies the user-defined importances to Perceptual Distance, Name Difference, Name Uniqueness, and Pair Preference scoring functions, which compare a potential sample to already-picked palette colors. After, a color is added to the palette by randomly sampling from the highest scoring palettes. Users can also specify hue ranges or build off their own starting palettes. This procedure differs from previous approaches that do not allow customization (e.g., pre-made ColorBrewer palettes) or do not consider visualization design constraints (e.g., Adobe Color and ACE). In a Palette Score Evaluation, we verified that each scoring function measured different color information. Experiment 1 demonstrated that slider manipulation generates palettes that are consistent with the expected balance of discriminability and aesthetic preference for 3-, 5-, and 8-color palettes, and also shows that the number of colors may change the effectiveness of pair-based discriminability and preference scores. For instance, if the Pair Preference slider were upweighted, users would judge the palettes as more preferable on average. Experiment 2 compared Colorgorical palettes to benchmark palettes (ColorBrewer, Microsoft, Tableau, Random). Colorgorical palettes are as discriminable and are at least as preferable or more preferable than the alternative palette sets. In sum, Colorgorical allows users to make customized color palettes that are, on average, as effective as current industry standards by balancing the importance of discriminability and aesthetic preference.","article_number":"7539386","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539386","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539386/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539386/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"521","end_page":"530","citing_paper_count":90,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2844,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Color","Image color analysis","Visualization","Harmonic analysis","Benchmark testing","Industries","Standards"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Aesthetics in Visualization","Color Perception","Metrics & Benchmarks","Visual Design","Visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Color Palette","Benchmark","Scoring Function","Industry Standards","Preference Score","Orientation Scores","Discrimination Scores","Distance Perception","Importance Of Orientation","Importance Of Preferences","Error Rate","Pairing","Multiple Linear Regression","Behavioral Measures","Harmony","Minimum Score","Color Space","Color Components","Discrimination Task","Discrimination Performance","Empirical Validation","Preference Ratings","Color Preference","Favorite Color","Traditional Color","Target Color","Dark Yellow","Normal Color Vision","CIELAB Color Space","Blue Hue","Color Discrimination","Differences In Perception","Design Area"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598920","title":"VLAT: Development of a Visualization Literacy Assessment Test","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":12,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Industrial Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085713433","id":37085713433,"full_name":"Sukwon Lee","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Industrial Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Seoul, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489894700","id":38489894700,"full_name":"Sung-Hee Kim","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Seoul, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"IBM T.J.

However, developing effective visual analytics solutions for this application domain is a challenging task due to the sheer volume and the complexity of the data collected in the manufacturing processes. We report the design and implementation of a comprehensive visual analytics system, ViDX. It supports both real-time tracking of assembly line performance and historical data exploration to identify inefficiencies, locate anomalies, and form hypotheses about their causes and effects. The system is designed based on a set of requirements gathered through discussions with the managers and operators from manufacturing sites. It features interlinked views displaying data at different levels of detail. In particular, we apply and extend the Marey's graph by introducing a time-aware outlier-preserving visual aggregation technique to support effective troubleshooting in manufacturing processes. We also introduce two novel interaction techniques, namely the quantiles brush and samples brush, for the users to interactively steer the outlier detection algorithms. We evaluate the system with example use cases and an in-depth user interview, both conducted together with the managers and operators from manufacturing plants. The result demonstrates its effectiveness and reports a successful pilot application of visual analytics for manufacturing in smart factories.","article_number":"7536610","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7536610","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536610/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536610/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"291","end_page":"300","citing_paper_count":84,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":3370,"insert_date":"20160809","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visual analytics","Industries","Manufacturing processes","Real-time systems"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Temporal Data","Marey's Graph","Visual Analytics","Manufacturing","Smart Factory","Connected Industry","Industry 4.0"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Assembly Line","Smart Manufacturing","Smart Factory","Assembly Line Performance","Causal Effect","Cause-and-effect","Cause-effect","In-depth Interviews","Manufacturing Process","Visual System","Visual Analysis","Applicability Domain","Visualization Techniques","Outlier Detection","Industrial Internet","Interaction Techniques","Different Levels Of Detail","User Interviews","Normal Process","Cycle Time","Historical Analysis","Design Requirements","3D Visualization","Fault Occurrence","Fault Happens","Occurrence Of Defects","Directed Acyclic Graph","Label Propagation Algorithm","Programmable Logic Controllers","Visual Encoding","Target User","Deployment Of Systems","Visual Patterns","Polyline","Abnormal Processing"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598620","title":"Data-Driven Guides: Supporting Expressive Design for Information Graphics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":15,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"John A.

Existing visualization creation tools support automatic visual encoding, but lack flexibility for creating custom design; on the other hand, freeform illustration tools require manual visual encoding, making the design process time-consuming and error-prone. In this paper, we present Data-Driven Guides (DDG), a technique for designing expressive information graphics in a graphic design environment. Instead of being confined by predefined templates or marks, designers can generate guides from data and use the guides to draw, place and measure custom shapes. We provide guides to encode data using three fundamental visual encoding channels: length, area, and position. Users can combine more than one guide to construct complex visual structures and map these structures to data. When underlying data is changed, we use a deformation technique to transform custom shapes using the guides as the backbone of the shapes. Our evaluation shows that data-driven guides allow users to create expressive and more accurate custom data-driven graphics.","article_number":"7536218","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7536218","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536218/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536218/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"491","end_page":"500","citing_paper_count":82,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2062,"insert_date":"20160808","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Encoding","Shape","Manuals","Design tools"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Information graphics","visualization","design tools","2D graphics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Infographic","Graphical Display","Design Process","Graphic Design","Visual Encoding","Design Tool","Ideal Tool","User Study","Direct Use","Direct Utilization","Direct Manipulation","Current Design","Current Name","Practical Design","Flexible Design","Visualization Techniques","Vector Graphics","Version Of Vector","Vector Format","Image Vector","Design Goals","Programming Experience","Visual Markers","Principal Curvatures","Curved Lines","Presentation Software","Graphical Tool","Copy And Paste","Lack Of Flexibility","Drawing Tool","Visual Design","Visual Representation Of Data","Visual Construction","Complex Structure","Visual Representation","Creativity","Creative Thinking"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598416","title":"SemanticTraj: A New Approach to Interacting with Massive Taxi Trajectories","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":16,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Kent State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085901152","id":37085901152,"full_name":"Shamal Al-Dohuki","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Kent State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Kent State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085901285","id":37085901285,"full_name":"Yingyu Wu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Kent State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Kent State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085905956","id":37085905956,"full_name":"Farah Kamw","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Kent State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina, Charlotte","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37292632600","id":37292632600,"full_name":"Jing Yang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina, Charlotte","UNC Charlotte"]}},{"affiliation":"China Petroleum University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088711523","id":37088711523,"full_name":"Xin Li","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["China Petroleum University"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Kent State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37277701200","id":37277701200,"full_name":"Ye Zhao","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Kent State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Geography","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085721950","id":37085721950,"full_name":"Xinyue Ye","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Geography","Kent State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37291847800","id":37291847800,"full_name":"Wei Chen","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Kent State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085388753","id":37085388753,"full_name":"Chao Ma","author_order":9,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Kent State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085517058","id":37085517058,"full_name":"Fei Wang","author_order":10,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Zhejiang University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Massive taxi trajectory data is exploited for knowledge discovery in transportation and urban planning. Existing tools typically require users to select and brush geospatial regions on a map when retrieving and exploring taxi trajectories and passenger trips. To answer seemingly simple questions such as “What were the taxi trips starting from Main Street and ending at Wall Street in the morning?” or “Where are the taxis arriving at the Art Museum at noon typically coming from?”, tedious and time consuming interactions are usually needed since the numeric GPS points of trajectories are not directly linked to the keywords such as “Main Street”, “Wall Street”, and “Art Museum”. In this paper, we present SemanticTraj, a new method for managing and visualizing taxi trajectory data in an intuitive, semantic rich, and efficient means. With SemanticTraj, domain and public users can find answers to the aforementioned questions easily through direct queries based on the terms. They can also interactively explore the retrieved data in visualizations enhanced by semantic information of the trajectories and trips. In particular, taxi trajectories are converted into taxi documents through a textualization transformation process. This process maps GPS points into a series of street/POI names and pick-up/drop-off locations. It also converts vehicle speeds into user-defined descriptive terms. Then, a corpus of taxi documents is formed and indexed to enable flexible semantic queries over a text search engine. Semantic labels and meta-summaries of the results are integrated with a set of visualizations in a SemanticTraj prototype, which helps users study taxi trajectories quickly and easily. A set of usage scenarios are presented to show the usability of the system. We also collected feedback from domain experts and conducted a preliminary user study to evaluate the visual system.","article_number":"7534822","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7534822","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7534822/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7534822/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"11","end_page":"20","citing_paper_count":72,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2916,"insert_date":"20160805","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Trajectory","Public transportation","Semantics","Search engines","Global Positioning System","Data visualization","Urban areas"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Taxi Trajectories","Taxi Document","Textualization","Name Query","Semantic Interaction","Text Search Engine"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Taxi Trajectory","Visual System","User Study","Massive Data","Semantic Information","Search String","Text Search","String Matching","Domain Experts","Trajectory Data","Descriptive Terms","Semantic Labels","Art Museum","Interactive Exploration","Usage Scenarios","Main Street","GPS Points","Average Speed","Boolean Logic","Logic Functions","Logic Operations","Interactive Visualization","Criminology","Street Names","Road Names","Pick-up Time","Index File","Range Query","Query Results","Text Labels","Query Performance","Visual Exploration","Visual Interface","Max Speed"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598830","title":"Multi-Resolution Climate Ensemble Parameter Analysis with Nested Parallel Coordinates Plots","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":17,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"The Ohio State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085897852","id":37085897852,"full_name":"Junpeng Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The Ohio State University"]}},{"affiliation":"The Ohio State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38528018400","id":38528018400,"full_name":"Xiaotong Liu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The Ohio State University"]}},{"affiliation":"The Ohio State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279493500","id":37279493500,"full_name":"Han-Wei Shen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The Ohio State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086596451","id":37086596451,"full_name":"Guang Lin","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Due to the uncertain nature of weather prediction, climate simulations are usually performed multiple times with different spatial resolutions. The outputs of simulations are multi-resolution spatial temporal ensembles. Each simulation run uses a unique set of values for multiple convective parameters. Distinct parameter settings from different simulation runs in different resolutions constitute a multi-resolution high-dimensional parameter space. Understanding the correlation between the different convective parameters, and establishing a connection between the parameter settings and the ensemble outputs are crucial to domain scientists. The multi-resolution high-dimensional parameter space, however, presents a unique challenge to the existing correlation visualization techniques. We present Nested Parallel Coordinates Plot (NPCP), a new type of parallel coordinates plots that enables visualization of intra-resolution and inter-resolution parameter correlations. With flexible user control, NPCP integrates superimposition, juxtaposition and explicit encodings in a single view for comparative data visualization and analysis. We develop an integrated visual analytics system to help domain scientists understand the connection between multi-resolution convective parameters and the large spatial temporal ensembles. Our system presents intricate climate ensembles with a comprehensive overview and on-demand geographic details. We demonstrate NPCP, along with the climate ensemble visualization system, based on real-world use-cases from our collaborators in computational and predictive science.","article_number":"7539323","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539323","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539323/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539323/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"81","end_page":"90","citing_paper_count":70,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1680,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Meteorology","Data visualization","Computational modeling","Correlation","Atmospheric modeling","Visualization","Spatial resolution"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Parallel coordinates plots","parameter analysis","multi-resolution climate ensembles"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Parallel Coordinates","Parallel Coordinates Plot","Climate Ensemble","Visual System","Parameter Space","Climate Models","Climate Simulations","Simulation Run","Large Ensemble","Convection Parameter","High-dimensional Parameter","High-dimensional Parameter Space","Real-world Use Cases","Dendrogram","Symmetric Matrix","Symmetric Matrices","Control Points","Line Segment","Simulation Accuracy","Smooth Transition","Agglomerative Clustering","Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering","Data Instances","Instantaneous Data","Ensemble Members","Primary Axis","Bezier Curve","Cubic Bézier","Bézier Curves","Dynamic Time Warping","Weather Research And Forecasting","Mental Maps","Secondary Axis","Range Query","Hierarchical Tree","Vertical Spread"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598647","title":"Authoring Data-Driven Videos with DataClips","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":18,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Manitoba, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37701811900","id":37701811900,"full_name":"Fereshteh Amini","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Manitoba, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590950700","id":37590950700,"full_name":"Nathalie Henry Riche","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37293389400","id":37293389400,"full_name":"Bongshin Lee","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38273431600","id":38273431600,"full_name":"Andres Monroy-Hernandez","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Manitoba, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283481700","id":37283481700,"full_name":"Pourang Irani","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Manitoba, Canada"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Data videos, or short data-driven motion graphics, are an increasingly popular medium for storytelling.

Interesting patterns of behavior typically manifest at several key areas of a city over multiple temporal resolutions.

Recent technological innovations have enabled the collection of enormous amounts of data that can help in these studies. However, techniques using these data sets typically focus on understanding the data in the context of the city, thus failing to capture the dynamic aspects of the city. The goal of this work is to instead understand the city in the context of multiple urban data sets. To do so, we define the concept of an “urban pulse” which captures the spatio-temporal activity in a city across multiple temporal resolutions. The prominent pulses in a city are obtained using the topology of the data sets, and are characterized as a set of beats. The beats are then used to analyze and compare different pulses. We also design a visual exploration framework that allows users to explore the pulses within and across multiple cities under different conditions. Finally, we present three case studies carried out by experts from two different domains that demonstrate the utility of our framework.","article_number":"7539380","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539380","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539380/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539380/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"791","end_page":"800","citing_paper_count":66,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1682,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Urban areas","Data visualization","Topology","Context","Visual analytics","Flickr"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Topology-based techniques","urban data","visual exploration"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Urban Planning","City Planning","Local Planning","Multiple Datasets","Urban Data","Visual Exploration","Multiple Resolutions","Multiple Cities","Activities In Cities","Urban Dataset","Time Step","Time Of Day","Value Function","Critical Point","Public Spaces","Spatial Domain","Social Media Data","Social Media Analytics","Urban Design","Local City","Spatiotemporal Data","New York City","SET Pulse","Prominent Locations","Spatiotemporal Datasets","Mesh Vertices","Mesh Vertex","Visual Interface","Presence Of Maxima","Central Park","Sublevel Set","Superlevel Sets","University Of New York","College Of New York","Time Resolution"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598624","title":"Hashedcubes: Simple, Low Memory, Real-Time Visual Exploration of Big Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":20,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Instituto de Informática, UFRGS","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085898354","id":37085898354,"full_name":"Cícero A.

In some instances, Hashedcubes notably requires two orders of magnitude less space than recent data cube visualization proposals. In this paper, we describe the algorithms to build and query Hashedcubes, and how it can drive well-known interactive visualizations such as binned scatterplots, linked histograms and heatmaps. We report memory usage, build time and query latencies for a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets, and find that although sometimes Hashedcubes offers slightly slower querying times to the state of the art, the typical query is answered fast enough to easily sustain a interaction. In datasets with hundreds of millions of elements, only about 2% of the queries take longer than 40ms. Finally, we discuss the limitations of data structure, potential spacetime tradeoffs, and future research directions.","article_number":"7539326","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539326","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539326/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539326/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"671","end_page":"680","citing_paper_count":66,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1839,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Arrays","Visualization","Big data","Memory management","Sorting"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Scalability","data cube","multidimensional data","interactive exploration"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Big Data","Data Structure","Real-world Datasets","Memory Usage","Interactive Visualization","Data Cube","Types Of Queries","Exploration Of Datasets","Hierarchical Structure","Hierarchical Organization","Twitter","Retweets","Data Visualization","Spatial Information","Temporal Dimension","Time Dimension","Temporal Properties","Spatial Dimensions","Spatial Attributes","Interactive System","GB Memory","Spatial Coordinates","Categorical Values","Category Information","Leaf Size","Quadtree","Dimensions Of Categories","Categories For Each Dimension","Query Time","Categorical Attributes","Classification Properties","Attribute Classification","Spatial Query","Arrival Delay","Memory Consumption","Scatterplot Matrix","Scatterplot Matrices","Spatiotemporal Datasets","Set Of Dimensions"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598589","title":"WeightLifter: Visual Weight Space Exploration for Multi-Criteria Decision Making","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":21,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085897204","id":37085897204,"full_name":"Stephan Pajer","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VRVis Research Center"]}},{"affiliation":"University Linz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403918900","id":37403918900,"full_name":"Marc Streit","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University Linz"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Vienna","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38340104300","id":38340104300,"full_name":"Thomas Torsney-Weir","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Vienna"]}},{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085886756","id":37085886756,"full_name":"Florian Spechtenhauser","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VRVis Research Center"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Vienna","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087444631","id":37087444631,"full_name":"Torsten Möller","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Vienna"]}},{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282562500","id":37282562500,"full_name":"Harald Piringer","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VRVis Research Center"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"A common strategy in Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is to rank alternative solutions by weighted summary scores. Weights, however, are often abstract to the decision maker and can only be set by vague intuition. While previous work supports a point-wise exploration of weight spaces, we argue that MCDM can benefit from a regional and global visual analysis of weight spaces. Our main contribution is WeightLifter, a novel interactive visualization technique for weight-based MCDM that facilitates the exploration of weight spaces with up to ten criteria. Our technique enables users to better understand the sensitivity of a decision to changes of weights, to efficiently localize weight regions where a given solution ranks high, and to filter out solutions which do not rank high enough for any plausible combination of weights. We provide a comprehensive requirement analysis for weight-based MCDM and describe an interactive workflow that meets these requirements. For evaluation, we describe a usage scenario of WeightLifter in automotive engineering and report qualitative feedback from users of a deployed version as well as preliminary feedback from decision makers in multiple domains. This feedback confirms that WeightLifter increases both the efficiency of weight-based MCDM and the awareness of uncertainty in the ultimate decisions.","article_number":"7536133","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7536133","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536133/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536133/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"611","end_page":"620","citing_paper_count":64,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1657,"insert_date":"20160808","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Automobiles","Visualization","Decision making","Sensitivity","Space exploration","Context","Additives"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual analysis","decision making","multi-objective optimization","interactive ranking","rank sensitivity"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Decision-making","Space Exploration","Space Missions","Multi-criteria Decision-making","Multi-criteria Decision Analysis","Visual Exploration","Weight Space","Weight Module","Weight Change","Global Analysis","Interactive Visualization","Internal Combustion Engine","Automotive Engineering","Combined Weight","Qualitative Feedback","Usage Scenarios","Ultimate Decision","Decision Uncertainty","Cost Function","Parameter Space","Visual Representation","Global Distribution","Current Solution","Multi-criteria Decision-making Problems","Rank Solution","Criteria Weights","Criterion Weights","Local Sensitivity","Additional Weight","Parallel Coordinates","Types Of Constraints","Combination Of Criteria","Combined Criterion","Favored Regions","Frequency Rank"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598868","title":"Time-Hierarchical Clustering and Visualization of Weather Forecast Ensembles","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":22,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Technical University of Munich","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606419000","id":37606419000,"full_name":"Florian Ferstl","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technical University of Munich"]}},{"affiliation":"Technical University of Munich","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085906749","id":37085906749,"full_name":"Mathias Kanzler","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technical University of Munich"]}},{"affiliation":"Technical University of Munich","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085907360","id":37085907360,"full_name":"Marc Rautenhaus","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technical University of Munich"]}},{"affiliation":"Technical University of Munich","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37444424000","id":37444424000,"full_name":"Rüdiger Westermann","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technical University of Munich"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We propose a new approach for analyzing the temporal growth of the uncertainty in ensembles of weather forecasts which are started from perturbed but similar initial conditions.

As a visualization, a TSI is composed of three common components: (1) a temporal layout, (2) comic strip-style data snapshots, and (3) textual annotations. To augment user analysis and exploration, we have developed a number of interactive techniques that recommend relevant data features and design choices, including an automatic annotations workflow. As the analysis and visual design processes converge, the resultant image becomes appropriate for data storytelling. For validation, we use a prototype implementation for TSIs to conduct two case studies with large-scale, scientific simulation datasets.","article_number":"7539294","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539294","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539294/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539294/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"511","end_page":"520","citing_paper_count":55,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2775,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Strips","Layout","Context","Data analysis","Additives"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Narrative visualization","storytelling","annotations","comic strip visualization","time-varying data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive","Temporal Images","Narrative Visualization","Design Process","Storytelling","Automatic Annotation","Visual Design","Snapshot Data","Text Annotation","Time-varying Data","Categorical Data","Appended","Temporal Dimension","Time Dimension","Temporal Properties","Cosmological","Temporal Data","Visualization Techniques","Exploration Process","Prominent Position","Visual Components","Relevant Ones","Placement Algorithm","Line Chart","Comic Strip","Automatic Scoring","Numerical Vectors","Set Of Views","Salient Regions","Attribution Scores","Properties Of The Dataset","Attributes In The Dataset","Axial Dimension"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598445","title":"TopicLens: Efficient Multi-Level Visual Topic Exploration of Large-Scale Document Collections","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":27,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Korea University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085889286","id":37085889286,"full_name":"Minjeong Kim","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Korea University"]}},{"affiliation":"Korea University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085884012","id":37085884012,"full_name":"Kyeongpil Kang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Korea University"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085506226","id":37085506226,"full_name":"Deokgun Park","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Korea University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37602784600","id":37602784600,"full_name":"Jaegul Choo","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Korea University"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295438200","id":37295438200,"full_name":"Niklas Elmqvist","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Topic modeling, which reveals underlying topics of a document corpus, has been actively adopted in visual analytics for large-scale document collections.

Instead, most such systems are limited to utilizing a fixed, initial set of topics. Motivated by this gap in the literature, we propose a novel interaction technique called TopicLens that allows a user to dynamically explore data through a lens interface where topic modeling and the corresponding 2D embedding are efficiently computed on the fly. To support this interaction in real time while maintaining view consistency, we propose a novel efficient topic modeling method and a semi-supervised 2D embedding algorithm. Our work is based on improving state-of-the-art methods such as nonnegative matrix factorization and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. Furthermore, we have built a web-based visual analytics system integrated with TopicLens. We use this system to measure the performance and the visualization quality of our proposed methods.

The user and the system continue to collaborate, incrementally producing more demonstrations and refining the transformations, until the most effective possible visualization is created. As a proof of concept, we present VisExemplar, a mixed-initiative prototype that allows users to explore their data by recommending appropriate transformations in response to the given demonstrations.","article_number":"7539327","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539327","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539327/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539327/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"331","end_page":"340","citing_paper_count":51,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2549,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Encoding","Bars","Image color analysis","Spatial databases","Automobiles"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization by Demonstration","Visualization Tools","Visual Data Exploration"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Visualization","Exploratory Data","Visual Exploration","Interaction Paradigm","Visual Data Exploration","Visual Representation","Presence Of Changes","Visualization Tool","Visual Presentation","Visual Demonstration","Visualization Techniques","Incremental Change","Visual Map","Visual Parameters","Transformation In Response","Cylindrical","Cylinder","Direct Use","Direct Utilization","Direct Manipulation","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Bar Charts","Design Guidelines","Spatial Encoding","Type Of Transformation","Point Shape","Visual Encoding","Usage Scenarios","Parallel Coordinates","Spatial Construction","Detailed View","User Interest"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598470","title":"Designing Progressive and Interactive Analytics Processes for High-Dimensional Data Analysis","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":29,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"City University, London, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37567685600","id":37567685600,"full_name":"Cagatay Turkay","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["City University, London, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Sabanci University, Turkey","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085899260","id":37085899260,"full_name":"Erdem Kaya","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sabanci University, Turkey"]}},{"affiliation":"Sabanci University, Turkey","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37371657600","id":37371657600,"full_name":"Selim Balcisoy","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sabanci University, Turkey"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Bergen, Norway","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274158800","id":37274158800,"full_name":"Helwig Hauser","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bergen, Norway"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In interactive data analysis processes, the dialogue between the human and the computer is the enabling mechanism that can lead to actionable observations about the phenomena being investigated. It is of paramount importance that this dialogue is not interrupted by slow computational mechanisms that do not consider any known temporal human-computer interaction characteristics that prioritize the perceptual and cognitive capabilities of the users. In cases where the analysis involves an integrated computational method, for instance to reduce the dimensionality of the data or to perform clustering, such non-optimal processes are often likely. To remedy this, progressive computations, where results are iteratively improved, are getting increasing interest in visual analytics. In this paper, we present techniques and design considerations to incorporate progressive methods within interactive analysis processes that involve high-dimensional data. We define methodologies to facilitate processes that adhere to the perceptual characteristics of users and describe how online algorithms can be incorporated within these. A set of design recommendations and according methods to support analysts in accomplishing high-dimensional data analysis tasks are then presented. Our arguments and decisions here are informed by observations gathered over a series of analysis sessions with analysts from finance. We document observations and recommendations from this study and present evidence on how our approach contribute to the efficiency and productivity of interactive visual analysis sessions involving high-dimensional data.","article_number":"7534760","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7534760","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7534760/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7534760/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"131","end_page":"140","citing_paper_count":51,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2378,"insert_date":"20160805","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Computers","Data analysis","Principal component analysis","Visual analytics","Algorithm design and analysis","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Progressive analytics","high dimensional data","iterative refinement","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive Process","High-dimensional Analysis","High-dimensional Data Analysis","Interaction Analysis","Visual Analysis","Design Considerations","Analysis Tasks","Computational Mechanisms","Online Algorithm","Capabilities Of Users","Theoretical Framework","Theoretical Model","Interpretation Of Results","Interpretation Of These Results","Exploratory Analysis","Exploratory Data Analysis","Use Of Tools","Calculation Results","Computational Results","Clustering Algorithm","Visual Representation","Singular Value Decomposition","Operational Level","High-dimensional Datasets","Adaptive Sampling","Credit Card","Visualization Techniques","Interaction Techniques","Similar Demographics","Uncertainty Calculation","Computational Uncertainty","Visual Approach","Rest Of The Data","Caching"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598667","title":"cite2vec: Citation-Driven Document Exploration via Word Embeddings","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":30,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Air Force Research Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088396413","id":37088396413,"full_name":"Matthew Berger","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Air Force Research Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085886677","id":37085886677,"full_name":"Katherine McDonough","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University"]}},{"affiliation":"Air Force Research Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37671422300","id":37671422300,"full_name":"Lee M.

Traditionally, document visualization is based on a data model that represents each document as the set of its comprised words, effectively characterizing what the document is. In this paper we take an alternative perspective: motivated by the manner in which users search documents in the research process, we aim to visualize documents via their usage, or how documents tend to be used. We present a new visualization scheme — cite2vec — that allows the user to dynamically explore and browse documents via how other documents use them, information that we capture through citation contexts in a document collection. Starting from a usage-oriented word-document 2D projection, the user can dynamically steer document projections by prescribing semantic concepts, both in the form of phrase/document compositions and document:phrase analogies, enabling the exploration and comparison of documents by their use. The user interactions are enabled by a joint representation of words and documents in a common high-dimensional embedding space where user-specified concepts correspond to linear operations of word and document vectors. Our case studies, centered around a large document corpus of computer vision research papers, highlight the potential for usage-based document visualization.","article_number":"7539398","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539398","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539398/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539398/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"691","end_page":"700","citing_paper_count":51,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2224,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Two dimensional displays","Visualization","Context","Data visualization","Tracking","Object detection","Semantics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["document visualization","word embeddings"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Word Embedding","Word Vectors","High-dimensional","High-dimensional Space","Computer Vision","Research Papers","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Latent Space","Embedding Space","Collection Of Papers","Document Collection","2D Projection","Visual Strategies","Interactive","Convolutional Neural Network","Negative Samples","Linear Structure","Topic Modeling","Pairwise Combinations","Specific Concepts","2D Space","Term Frequency-inverse Document Frequency","Inverse Document Frequency","TF-IDF","Citation Counts","Citation Impact","Citation Metrics","Computer Vision Applications","Context Vector","Citation Network","Word2vec Model","Skip-gram Model","Weak Supervision","Projective Space","Multiple Concepts","Context Window","Human Pose","2D Position"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598695","title":"Visual Analytics for Mobile Eye Tracking","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":31,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489885500","id":38489885500,"full_name":"Kuno Kurzhals","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546168600","id":37546168600,"full_name":"Marcel Hlawatsch","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart"]}},{"affiliation":"Stuttgart Media University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085900801","id":37085900801,"full_name":"Christof Seeger","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Stuttgart Media University"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268045000","id":37268045000,"full_name":"Daniel Weiskopf","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The analysis of eye tracking data often requires the annotation of areas of interest (AOIs) to derive semantic interpretations of human viewing behavior during experiments.

We provide a novel visual analytics approach to ease this annotation process by image-based, automatic clustering of eye tracking data integrated in an interactive labeling and analysis system. The annotation and analysis are tightly coupled by multiple linked views that allow for a direct interpretation of the labeled data in the context of the recorded video stimuli. The components of our analytics environment were developed with a user-centered design approach in close cooperation with an eye tracking expert. We demonstrate our approach with eye tracking data from a real experiment and compare it to an analysis of the data by manual annotation of dynamic AOIs. Furthermore, we conducted an expert user study with 6 external eye tracking researchers to collect feedback and identify analysis strategies they used while working with our application.","article_number":"7539297","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539297","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539297/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539297/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"301","end_page":"310","citing_paper_count":50,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":3229,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Gaze tracking","Videos","Mobile communication","Labeling","Data visualization","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Eye tracking","visual analytics","video visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Eye-tracking","Mobile Eye-tracking","User Study","User-centered","Human-centered Design","User-centered Design","Annotation Process","Visual Approach","Eye-tracking Data","Video Stimuli","Video Stimulus","Histogram","Similarity Matrix","Similarity Matrices","Video Frames","Video Data","Visualization Techniques","Image Retrieval","Image Search","Collaborative Partnerships","Cluster Representatives","Labeling Process","Specific Areas Of Interest","Area Of Particular Interest","Query Image","Gaze Points","Main View","Distribution Of Attention","Video Player","Gaze Data","Annotation Approach","Color Labels","Hardware Store","Color Histogram","Clustering Segmentation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598444","title":"Visual Analysis of MOOC Forums with iForum","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":32,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085458481","id":37085458481,"full_name":"Siwei Fu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Autodesk Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38024987300","id":38024987300,"full_name":"Jian Zhao","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Autodesk Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37391623900","id":37391623900,"full_name":"Weiwei Cui","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Discussion forums of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) provide great opportunities for students to interact with instructional staff as well as other students.

The main contribution of this paper is the validated design of Visplause, a system to support an efficient inspection of DQ problems for many time series. The key idea of Visplause is to utilize meta-information concerning the semantics of both the time series and the plausibility checks for structuring and summarizing results of DQ checks in a flexible way. Linked views enable users to inspect anomalies in detail and to generate hypotheses about possible causes. The design of Visplause was guided by goals derived from a comprehensive task analysis with domain experts in the energy sector. We reflect on the design process by discussing design decisions at four stages and we identify lessons learned. We also report feedback from domain experts after using Visplause for a period of one month.

Many algorithms have been proposed to sample graphs, and the performance of these algorithms has been quantified through metrics based on graph structural properties preserved by the sampling: degree distribution, clustering coefficient, and others. However, a perspective that is missing is the impact of these sampling strategies on the resultant visualizations. In this paper, we present the results of three user studies that investigate how sampling strategies influence node-link visualizations of graphs. In particular, five sampling strategies widely used in the graph mining literature are tested to determine how well they preserve visual features in node-link diagrams. Our results show that depending on the sampling strategy used different visual features are preserved. These results provide a complimentary view to metric evaluations conducted in the graph mining literature and provide an impetus to conduct future visualization studies.","article_number":"7539318","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539318","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539318/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539318/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"401","end_page":"410","citing_paper_count":44,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2056,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Measurement","Data visualization","Data mining","Fires","Scalability","Clustering algorithms"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Graph visualization","graph sampling","empirical evaluation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Graph Structure","Degree Distribution","Clustering Coefficient","Large Graphs","Sampling Rate","Random Walk","Coverage Area","Wildfire","Forest Fires","Bushfire","Nodes In The Graph","Average Degree","Performance Of Strategies","Visibility Graph","Scale-free Networks","Node Samples","Lymph Node Samples","Clustering Quality","Distribution Of Nodes","Graph Size","Original Graph","High-degree Nodes","Nodes In Set","Random Node","Graph Layout","Graph Drawing","Incident Edges","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Induced Subgraph","Graph Properties","Attributed Graph","Average Node Degree","Dense Clusters","Compact Clusters","Small Graphs","Within-subject Design","Repeated-measures Design"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598958","title":"Towards Unambiguous Edge Bundling: Investigating Confluent Drawings for Network Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":36,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research-Inria Joint Centre, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085687578","id":37085687578,"full_name":"Benjamin Bach","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research-Inria Joint Centre, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research, WA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590950700","id":37590950700,"full_name":"Nathalie Henry Riche","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research, WA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"ENAC, Toulouse, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017336200","id":38017336200,"full_name":"Christophe Hurter","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["ENAC, Toulouse, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University, Melbourne, Australia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37354163600","id":37354163600,"full_name":"Kim Marriott","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University, Melbourne, Australia"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University, Melbourne, Australia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37326161000","id":37326161000,"full_name":"Tim Dwyer","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University, Melbourne, Australia"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate Confluent Drawings (CD), a technique for bundling edges in node-link diagrams based on network connectivity. Edge-bundling techniques are designed to reduce edge clutter in node-link diagrams by coalescing lines into common paths or bundles. Unfortunately, traditional bundling techniques introduce ambiguity since edges are only bundled by spatial proximity, rather than network connectivity; following an edge from its source to its target can lead to the perception of incorrect connectivity if edges are not clearly separated within the bundles. Contrary, CDs bundle edges based on common sources or targets. Thus, a smooth path along a confluent bundle indicates precise connectivity. While CDs have been described in theory, practical investigation and application to real-world networks (i.e., networks beyond those with certain planarity restrictions) is currently lacking. Here, we provide the first algorithm for constructing CDs from arbitrary directed and undirected networks and present a simple layout method, embedded in a sand box environment providing techniques for interactive exploration. We then investigate patterns and artifacts in CDs, which we compare to other common edge-bundling techniques. Finally, we present the first user study that compares edge-compression techniques, including CD, power graphs, metro-style, and common edge bundling. We found that users without particular expertise in visualization or network analysis are able to read small CDs without difficulty. Compared to existing bundling techniques, CDs are more likely to allow people to correctly perceive connectivity.","article_number":"7539373","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539373","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539373/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539373/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"541","end_page":"550","citing_paper_count":44,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1890,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Clutter","Layout","Australia","Topology","Systematics","Complex networks"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Network visualization","edge compression","confluent","power graph","bundling"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Network","Network Diagram","Edge Bundling","User Study","Real-world Networks","Undirected Network","Precise Connections","Communication Network","Readability","Completion Time","Shortest Path","Classification Network","Friedman Test","Visual Patterns","Transmission Network","Individual Nodes","Graph Topology","Example Of Network","Directed Networks","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Network Motifs","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Joint Point","Articulation Points","Arbitrary Network","Single Bundle","Graph Layout","Graph Drawing","Outgoing Edges","Common Neighbors","Common Neighbours","Twitter","Retweets","Source Code","Data Compression"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598446","title":"AxiSketcher: Interactive Nonlinear Axis Mapping of Visualizations through User Drawings","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":37,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"IBM T.J.

However, it is often challenging for users to express their domain knowledge in order to steer the underlying data model, especially when they have little attribute-level knowledge. Furthermore, users' complex, high-level domain knowledge, compared to low-level attributes, posits even greater challenges. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a technique to interpret a user's drawings with an interactive, nonlinear axis mapping approach called AxiSketcher. This technique enables users to impose their domain knowledge on a visualization by allowing interaction with data entries rather than with data attributes. The proposed interaction is performed through directly sketching lines over the visualization. Using this technique, users can draw lines over selected data points, and the system forms the axes that represent a nonlinear, weighted combination of multidimensional attributes. In this paper, we describe our techniques in three areas: 1) the design space of sketching methods for eliciting users' nonlinear domain knowledge; 2) the underlying model that translates users' input, extracts patterns behind the selected data points, and results in nonlinear axes reflecting users' complex intent; and 3) the interactive visualization for viewing, assessing, and reconstructing the newly formed, nonlinear axes.","article_number":"7534876","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7534876","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7534876/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7534876/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"221","end_page":"230","citing_paper_count":43,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1245,"insert_date":"20160805","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visual analytics","Analytical models","Data models","Automobiles","Computational modeling","Manifolds"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["axis mapping","interactive model steering","sketch","axis visualization","human-centered visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interaction Map","Cognitive Domains","Domain Knowledge","Visual Analysis","Visualization Techniques","Interactive Visualization","Line Drawings","Nonlinear Approach","Dimensionality Reduction","Nonlinear Model","Classification Techniques","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Mental Models","Detailed View","Dimensionality Reduction Methods","Sequence Of Points","Usage Intention","Projection Point","Locally Linear Embedding","Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction","Polyline","Interaction Techniques","Main View","Parallel Coordinates","Safety Index","Safety Indices","Data Analysis Tasks","Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction Method","High-dimensional Representation","Scientific Visualization","Line Spacing","Types Of Interactions","Consumer Price Index","Consumer Price Indices"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2599217","title":"Hybrid Tactile/Tangible Interaction for 3D Data Exploration","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":38,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Inria Saclay, Univ.

Aerodynamics experts have been working on detecting the early signs of stall in order to devise novel stall suppression technologies. A state-of-the-art Navier-Stokes based, time-accurate computational fluid dynamics simulator, TURBO, has been developed in NASA to enhance the understanding of flow phenomena undergoing rotating stall. Despite the proven high modeling accuracy of TURBO, the excessive simulation data prohibits post-hoc analysis in both storage and I/O time. To address these issues and allow the expert to perform scalable stall analysis, we have designed an in situ distribution guided stall analysis technique. Our method summarizes statistics of important properties of the simulation data in situ using a probabilistic data modeling scheme. This data summarization enables statistical anomaly detection for flow instability in post analysis, which reveals the spatiotemporal trends of rotating stall for the expert to conceive new hypotheses. Furthermore, the verification of the hypotheses and exploratory visualization using the summarized data are realized using probabilistic visualization techniques such as uncertain isocontouring. Positive feedback from the domain scientist has indicated the efficacy of our system in exploratory stall analysis.","article_number":"7539561","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539561","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539561/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539561/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"811","end_page":"820","citing_paper_count":40,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1444,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Data models","Analytical models","Computational modeling","Blades","Engines","Compressors"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["In situ analysis","rotating stall analysis","Gaussian mixture model","incremental distribution modeling","feature analysis","high performance computing","collaborative development"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Post Hoc Test","Post Hoc Analysis","Visualization Techniques","Anomaly Detection","Hypothesis Verification","Flow Instability","Time Step","Mixture Model","Gaussian Mixture","Spatial Domain","Domain Experts","Gaussian Mixture Model","Incremental Learning","Continuous Learning","Formation Of Regions","Simulation Run","Mass Flow Rate","Spatial Regions","Data Block","Angle Of Attack","Local Disturbances","Tip Region","Spatial Visualization","Earth Mover’s Distance","Pressure Anomalies","Alpha Matte","Alpha Maps","Alpha Blending","Alpha Channel","Pressure Probe","Time-varying Data","Isosurface","Incremental Algorithm","Over Space","Hyperspace","Time And Space","Spacetime","Values Of Variables"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598497","title":"VisFlow - Web-based Visualization Framework for Tabular Data with a Subset Flow Model","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":40,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085505340","id":37085505340,"full_name":"Bowen Yu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University"]}},{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275249200","id":37275249200,"full_name":"Cláudio T.

Visualization systems may benefit from user-defined data flows as an analysis typically consists of rendering multiple plots on demand and performing different types of interactive queries across coordinated views. In this paper, we propose VisFlow, a web-based visualization framework for tabular data that employs a specific type of data flow model called the subset flow model. VisFlow focuses on interactive queries within the data flow, overcoming the limitation of interactivity from past computational data flow systems. In particular, VisFlow applies embedded visualizations and supports interactive selections, brushing and linking within a visualization-oriented data flow. The model requires all data transmitted by the flow to be a data item subset (i.e. groups of table rows) of some original input table, so that rendering properties can be assigned to the subset unambiguously for tracking and comparison. VisFlow features the analysis flexibility of a flow diagram, and at the same time reduces the diagram complexity and improves usability. We demonstrate the capability of VisFlow on two case studies with domain experts on real-world datasets showing that VisFlow is capable of accomplishing a considerable set of visualization and analysis tasks. The VisFlow system is available as open source on GitHub.","article_number":"7536189","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7536189","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536189/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536189/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"251","end_page":"260","citing_paper_count":40,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2225,"insert_date":"20160808","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Data models","Computational modeling","Rendering (computer graphics)","Pipelines","Joining processes","Data analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization framework","data flow","subset flow model","tabular data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Flow Model","Flow Diagram","Flow Data","Domain Experts","Row Of Table","Interaction Analysis","Subset Of Data","Visual Network","Network Diagram","Gene Names","Heterogeneous Data","Data Heterogeneity","Design Choices","Interactive Visualization","Directed Acyclic Graph","Types Of Nodes","Output Ports","Input Port","Pitchers","Line Chart","User Selection","Parallel Coordinates","Attribute Values","Incident Edges","Visual Capabilities","Workflow","Visual Analysis Of Data","Multiple Games","Exploratory Data","Computational Biology"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598588","title":"PROACT: Iterative Design of a Patient-Centered Visualization for Effective Prostate Cancer Health Risk Communication","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":41,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Tufts University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085894306","id":37085894306,"full_name":"Anzu Hakone","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tufts University"]}},{"affiliation":"Worcester Polytechnic Institute","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546111900","id":37546111900,"full_name":"Lane Harrison","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Worcester Polytechnic Institute"]}},{"affiliation":"Tufts University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38513524100","id":38513524100,"full_name":"Alvitta Ottley","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tufts University"]}},{"affiliation":"Tufts University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085893614","id":37085893614,"full_name":"Nathan Winters","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tufts University"]}},{"affiliation":"Maine Medical Center","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085890149","id":37085890149,"full_name":"Caitlin Gutheil","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Maine Medical Center"]}},{"affiliation":"Maine Medical Center","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085701650","id":37085701650,"full_name":"Paul K.

Accumulating evidence suggests that the available treatment options, including surgery and conservative treatment, result in a similar prognosis for most men with localized prostate cancer. However, approximately 90% of patients choose surgery over conservative treatment, despite the risk of severe side effects like erectile dysfunction and incontinence. Recent medical research suggests that a key reason is the lack of patient-centered tools that can effectively communicate personalized risk information and enable them to make better health decisions. In this paper, we report the iterative design process and results of developing the PROgnosis Assessment for Conservative Treatment (PROACT) tool, a personalized health risk communication tool for localized prostate cancer patients. PROACT utilizes two published clinical prediction models to communicate the patients' personalized risk estimates and compare treatment options. In collaboration with the Maine Medical Center, we conducted two rounds of evaluations with prostate cancer survivors and urologists to identify the design elements and narrative structure that effectively facilitate patient comprehension under emotional distress. Our results indicate that visualization can be an effective means to communicate complex risk information to patients with low numeracy and visual literacy. However, the visualizations need to be carefully chosen to balance readability with ease of comprehension. In addition, due to patients' charged emotional state, an intuitive narrative structure that considers the patients' information need is critical to aid the patients' comprehension of their risk information.","article_number":"7539638","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539638","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539638/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539638/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"601","end_page":"610","citing_paper_count":39,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1549,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Prostate cancer","Data visualization","Visualization","Prognostics and health management","Medical diagnostic imaging"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Design studies","task and requirement analysis","presentation","production","and dissemination","medical visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Prostate Cancer","Health Risks","Effective Communication","Risk Communication","Iterative Design","Loop Design","Health Risk Communication","Side Effects","Treatment Options","Emotional States","Conservative Treatment","Conservative Therapy","Conservative Management","Urological","Operative Treatment","Surgery Treatment","Operative Intervention","Clinical Model","Erectile Dysfunction","Impotence","Low Literacy","Complex Information","Need For Information","Personal Risk","Risk Information","Localized Cancer","Active Treatment","Prostate Cancer Risk","Pie Chart","Health Information","Prostate Cancer Mortality","Prostate Cancer Mortality Rates","Treatment Of Prostate Cancer","Type Of Visualization","Lower Risk Of Mortality","Radical Prostatectomy","Survival Rate","Disease-free Survival"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598590","title":"Visualizing Social Media Content with SentenTree","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":42,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Twitter Inc.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38238187000","id":38238187000,"full_name":"Mengdie Hu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Twitter Inc.","Georgia Institute of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Twitter Inc.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37670523200","id":37670523200,"full_name":"Krist Wongsuphasawat","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Twitter Inc."]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267736900","id":37267736900,"full_name":"John Stasko","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We introduce SentenTree, a novel technique for visualizing the content of unstructured social media text.

However powerful, the class of analyses these systems enable is somewhat limited: specifically, one can only quickly obtain plots such as histograms and heatmaps. In this paper, we contribute Gaussian Cubes, which significantly improves on state-of-the-art systems by providing interactive modeling capabilities, which include but are not limited to linear least squares and principal components analysis (PCA). The fundamental insight in Gaussian Cubes is that instead of precomputing counts of many data subsets (as state-of-the-art systems do), Gaussian Cubes precomputes the best multivariate Gaussian for the respective data subsets. As an example, Gaussian Cubes can fit hundreds of models over millions of data points in well under a second, enabling novel types of visual exploration of such large datasets. We present three case studies that highlight the visualization and analysis capabilities in Gaussian Cubes, using earthquake safety simulations, astronomical catalogs, and transportation statistics. The dataset sizes range around one hundred million elements and 5 to 10 dimensions. We present extensive performance results, a discussion of the limitations in Gaussian Cubes, and future research directions.","article_number":"7536648","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7536648","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536648/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536648/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"681","end_page":"690","citing_paper_count":37,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1098,"insert_date":"20160809","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data models","Data visualization","Computational modeling","Analytical models","Visualization","Principal component analysis","Manuals"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data modeling","dimensionality reduction","interactive visualization","data cubes"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Large Datasets","Exploration Of Datasets","Exploration Of Large Datasets","Seismic","Earthquake","Least Squares Regression","Linear Least Squares","Subset Of Data","Fundamental Insights","Exploratory Analysis","Exploratory Data Analysis","Covariance Matrix","Covariance Matrices","Data Mining","Visual System","Ordinary Least Squares","Airport","Spatial Dimensions","Spatial Attributes","Index Variables","Variability Indices","Color Map","Matrix M","Matrices M","Portion Of Data","Help Of Data","Interactive Visualization","Least Squares Problem","Data Cube","Sufficient Statistics","Query Time","Fast Query","Different Subsets Of Data","Linear Scan","Visual Encoding","Value Dimensions","Statistical Models","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598919","title":"Probabilistic Graph Layout for Uncertain Network Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":44,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"VISUS, University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085884246","id":37085884246,"full_name":"Christoph Schulz","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VISUS, University of Stuttgart"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085772409","id":37085772409,"full_name":"Arlind Nocaj","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085890167","id":37085890167,"full_name":"Jochen Goertler","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266781000","id":37266781000,"full_name":"Oliver Deussen","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550836200","id":37550836200,"full_name":"Ulrik Brandes","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz"]}},{"affiliation":"VISUS, University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268045000","id":37268045000,"full_name":"Daniel Weiskopf","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VISUS, University of Stuttgart"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present a novel uncertain network visualization technique based on node-link diagrams.

This paper explores two related approaches to quantifying the confidence we may have in making visual inferences from mapped geospatial data. We adapt Wickham et al.'s `Visual Line-up' method as a direct analogy with Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) and propose a new approach for generating more credible spatial null hypotheses. Rather than using as a spatial null hypothesis the unrealistic assumption of complete spatial randomness, we propose spatially autocorrelated simulations as alternative nulls. We conduct a set of crowdsourced experiments (n=361) to determine the just noticeable difference (JND) between pairs of choropleth maps of geographic units controlling for spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I statistic) and geometric configuration (variance in spatial unit area). Results indicate that people's abilities to perceive differences in spatial autocorrelation vary with baseline autocorrelation structure and the geometric configuration of geographic units. These results allow us, for the first time, to construct a visual equivalent of statistical power for geospatial data. Our JND results add to those provided in recent years by Klippel et al. (2011), Harrison et al. (2014) and Kay & Heer (2015) for correlation visualization. Importantly, they provide an empirical basis for an improved construction of visual line-ups for maps and the development of theory to inform geospatial tests of graphical inference.","article_number":"7539286","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539286","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539286/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539286/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"391","end_page":"400","citing_paper_count":36,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1319,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Correlation","Visualization","Geography","Adaptation models","Data visualization","Geospatial analysis","Testing"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Graphical inference","spatial autocorrelation","just noticeable difference","geovisualization","statistical significance"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Spatial Structure","Effect Of Spatial Structure","Null Hypothesis","Spatial Autocorrelation","Spatial Units","Geographical Units","Just Noticeable Difference","Autocorrelation Structure","Complete Randomness","Choropleth Maps","Complete Spatial Randomness","Differential Effects","Exploratory Analysis","Exploratory Data Analysis","Error Rate","Ceiling Effect","Regular Grid","Cartesian Grid","Grid Structure","Rectangular Grid","Smaller Units","Degree Of Dependence","Degree Of Reliability","Differential Correlation","Spatial Processing","Floor Effects","Staircase Procedure","Crime Rates","Classical Statistics","Frequentist Inference","Frequentist Statistics","Between-participant Variability","Stability Criterion","Stability Criteria","Positive Spatial Autocorrelation","Crowdsourcing Platforms","Prediction Intervals"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598544","title":"Familiarity Vs Trust: A Comparative Study of Domain Scientists' Trust in Visual Analytics and Conventional Analysis Methods","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":46,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593202500","id":37593202500,"full_name":"Aritra Dasgupta","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085904205","id":37085904205,"full_name":"Joon-Yong Lee","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085901445","id":37085901445,"full_name":"Ryan Wilson","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085902427","id":37085902427,"full_name":"Robert A.

These visual analytic methods are beginning to be instantiated within mixed-initiative systems, where humans and machines collaboratively influence evidence-gathering and decision-making. But an open research question is that, when domain experts analyze their data, can they completely trust the outputs and operations on the machine-side? Visualization potentially leads to a transparent analysis process, but do domain experts always trust what they see? To address these questions, we present results from the design and evaluation of a mixed-initiative, visual analytics system for biologists, focusing on analyzing the relationships between familiarity of an analysis medium and domain experts' trust. We propose a trust-augmented design of the visual analytics system, that explicitly takes into account domain-specific tasks, conventions, and preferences. For evaluating the system, we present the results of a controlled user study with 34 biologists where we compare the variation of the level of trust across conventional and visual analytic mediums and explore the influence of familiarity and task complexity on trust. We find that despite being unfamiliar with a visual analytic medium, scientists seem to have an average level of trust that is comparable with the same in conventional analysis medium. In fact, for complex sense-making tasks, we find that the visual analytic system is able to inspire greater trust than other mediums. We summarize the implications of our findings with directions for future research on trustworthiness of visual analytic systems.","article_number":"7536106","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7536106","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536106/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536106/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"271","end_page":"280","citing_paper_count":36,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1667,"insert_date":"20160808","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Data visualization","Biology","Uncertainty","Data analysis","Bioinformatics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["trust","transparency","familiarity","uncertainty","biological data analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Analytical Methods","Visual Analysis","Conventional Analysis","Conventional Analysis Methods","Visual Analytics Methods","Visual System","User Study","Domain Experts","Conventional Media","Conventional Culture Medium","Quantitative Data","Quantitative Method","Quantitative Assessment","Quantitative Research","Quantitative Studies","Quantitative Approach","Heatmap","Effect Of Experience","Visual Representation","Experiences Of Participants","Visualization Tool","Lack Of Trust","Design Criteria","Design Criterion","Scientific Experiments","Between-subjects Design","Between-group Design","Interpretation Task","Visual Analytics Tool","Manual Analysis","Familiar Methods","Visual Design","Trust In Systems","Analysis Of Biological Data","Trust Issues","Think-aloud Protocols","Workflow"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598609","title":"Iterating between Tools to Create and Edit Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":47,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085905494","id":37085905494,"full_name":"Alex Bigelow","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37585786500","id":37585786500,"full_name":"Steven Drucker","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37542391000","id":37542391000,"full_name":"Danyel Fisher","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564728700","id":37564728700,"full_name":"Miriah Meyer","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Utah"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"A common workflow for visualization designers begins with a generative tool, like D3 or Processing, to create the initial visualization; and proceeds to a drawing tool, like Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape, for editing and cleaning.

In this paper, we propose a bridge model to allow designers to bring their work back from the drawing tool to re-edit in the generative tool. Our key insight is to recast this iteration challenge as a merge problem - similar to when two people are editing a document and changes between them need to reconciled. We also present a specific instantiation of this model, a tool called Hanpuku, which bridges between D3 scripts and Illustrator. We show several examples of visualizations that are iteratively created using Hanpuku in order to illustrate the flexibility of the approach. We further describe several hypothetical tools that bridge between other visualization tools to emphasize the generality of the model.","article_number":"7539580","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539580","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539580/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539580/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"481","end_page":"490","citing_paper_count":34,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1135,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Bridges","Data visualization","Visualization","Software","Solid modeling","Manuals","Image color analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","iteration","illustration"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visualization Tool","General Tool","Visual Design","Drawing Tool","Bridge Model","Design Process","Types Of Changes","Programming Environment","Infographic","Graphical Display","Design Space","Variety Of Tools","Diverse Tools","Color Map","Pie Chart","Iterative Design","Loop Design","Log Files","Working Mode","Visible Part","Update Function","Updated Map","Style Changes","Graphical Elements","Shared Elements","Color Palette","Edge Coloring","Identification Tags","Aspects Of Representation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598869","title":"Visualization of Time-Varying Weather Ensembles across Multiple Resolutions","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":48,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"GRAVITY group, The Ohio State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077194500","id":37077194500,"full_name":"Ayan Biswas","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["GRAVITY group, The Ohio State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086596451","id":37086596451,"full_name":"Guang Lin","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University"]}},{"affiliation":"GRAVITY group, The Ohio State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38528018400","id":38528018400,"full_name":"Xiaotong Liu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["GRAVITY group, The Ohio State University"]}},{"affiliation":"GRAVITY group, The Ohio State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279493500","id":37279493500,"full_name":"Han-Wei Shen","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["GRAVITY group, The Ohio State University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Uncertainty quantification in climate ensembles is an important topic for the domain scientists, especially for decision making in the real-world scenarios. With powerful computers, simulations now produce time-varying and multi-resolution ensemble data sets. It is of extreme importance to understand the model sensitivity given the input parameters such that more computation power can be allocated to the parameters with higher influence on the output. Also, when ensemble data is produced at different resolutions, understanding the accuracy of different resolutions helps the total time required to produce a desired quality solution with improved storage and computation cost. In this work, we propose to tackle these non-trivial problems on the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model output. We employ a moment independent sensitivity measure to quantify and analyze parameter sensitivity across spatial regions and time domain. A comparison of clustering structures across three resolutions enables the users to investigate the sensitivity variation over the spatial regions of the five input parameters. The temporal trend in the sensitivity values is explored via an MDS view linked with a line chart for interactive brushing. The spatial and temporal views are connected to provide a full exploration system for complete spatio-temporal sensitivity analysis. To analyze the accuracy across varying resolutions, we formulate a Bayesian approach to identify which regions are better predicted at which resolutions compared to the observed precipitation. This information is aggregated over the time domain and finally encoded in an output image through a custom color map that guides the domain experts towards an adaptive grid implementation given a cost model. Users can select and further analyze the spatial and temporal error patterns for multi-resolution accuracy analysis via brushing and linking on the produced image. In this work, we collaborate with a domain expert whose feedback shows the effectiveness of our proposed exploration work-flow.","article_number":"7539581","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539581","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539581/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539581/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"841","end_page":"850","citing_paper_count":33,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1425,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Meteorology","Spatial resolution","Uncertainty","Computational modeling","Data visualization","Sensitivity analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Ensemble","time-varying","multi-resolution","sensitivity analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Multiple Resolutions","Sensitivity Analysis","Spatial Patterns","Spatiotemporal Patterns","Temporal Patterns","Computational Cost","Accurate Analysis","Input Parameters","Sensitive Measure","Parameter Sensitivity","Spatial Domain","Domain Experts","Spatial Regions","Uncertainty Quantification","Spatial Error","Line Chart","Weather Research","Ensemble Data","Weather Research And Forecasting","Temporal Error","Time-varying Data","Simulation Model","Localization Prediction","Climate Models","Climate Simulations","Temporal Domain","Ensemble Simulations","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Lowest Resolution","Southern Great Plains","Bayesian Model Averaging","Climate Model Simulations","Detailed Exploration"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598498","title":"Investigating the Use of a Dynamic Physical Bar Chart for Data Exploration and Presentation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":49,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Lancaster University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085886811","id":37085886811,"full_name":"Faisal Taher","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Lancaster University"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Copenhagen","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37076983200","id":37076983200,"full_name":"Yvonne Jansen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Copenhagen"]}},{"affiliation":"Lancaster University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089132861","id":37089132861,"full_name":"Jonathan Woodruff","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Lancaster University"]}},{"affiliation":"Lancaster University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37903133900","id":37903133900,"full_name":"John Hardy","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Lancaster University"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Copenhagen","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38201832000","id":38201832000,"full_name":"Kasper Hornbæk","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Copenhagen"]}},{"affiliation":"Lancaster University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085617240","id":37085617240,"full_name":"Jason Alexander","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Lancaster University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Physical data representations, or data physicalizations, are a promising new medium to represent and communicate data. Previous work mostly studied passive physicalizations which require humans to perform all interactions manually. Dynamic shape-changing displays address this limitation and facilitate data exploration tasks such as sorting, navigating in data sets which exceed the fixed size of a given physical display, or preparing “views” to communicate insights about data. However, it is currently unclear how people approach and interact with such data representations. We ran an exploratory study to investigate how non-experts made use of a dynamic physical bar chart for an open-ended data exploration and presentation task. We asked 16 participants to explore a data set on European values and to prepare a short presentation of their insights using a physical display. We analyze: (1) users' body movements to understand how they approach and react to the physicalization, (2) their hand-gestures to understand how they interact with physical data, (3) system interactions to understand which subsets of the data they explored and which features they used in the process, and (4) strategies used to explore the data and present observations. We discuss the implications of our findings for the use of dynamic data physicalizations and avenues for future work.","article_number":"7542185","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7542185","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7542185/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7542185/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"451","end_page":"460","citing_paper_count":32,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1909,"insert_date":"20160811","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Bars","Data visualization","Training","Cameras","Navigation","Pressing"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Shape-changing displays","physicalization","physical visualization","bar charts","user behaviour","data presentation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Exploratory Data","Bar Charts","Navigation","Kinetic Data","Dynamic Data","Subset Of Data","Body Movements","Physical Representation","Physicalism","Walking","Interactive","Propensity","Leaning","Training Phase","Data In Way","Set Of Countries","Part Of Dataset","Movement Behavior","Movement Behaviours","Exploration Phase","Hidden Information","Hidden Data","Hand Gestures","Single View","Point Of Interest Data","Bar Height","Height Of Each Bar","Scrolling","Head Tilt","Groups Of Data Points","Data Points In Each Group","Irrelevant Data","Quick Succession","Entire Row","Partial Data","Logarithmic Scale","Log-scale"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598415","title":"A Visual Analytics Approach for Understanding Reasons behind Snowballing and Comeback in MOBA Games","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":50,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085720737","id":37085720737,"full_name":"Quan Li","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"NetEase, Inc.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085721107","id":37085721107,"full_name":"Peng Xu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["NetEase, Inc."]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085666246","id":37085666246,"full_name":"Yeuk Yin Chan","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086545328","id":37086545328,"full_name":"Yun Wang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"China Academy of Art","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085900648","id":37085900648,"full_name":"Zhipeng Wang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["China Academy of Art"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085504538","id":37085504538,"full_name":"Xiaojuan Ma","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"To design a successful Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game, the ratio of snowballing and comeback occurrences to all matches played must be maintained at a certain level to ensure its fairness and engagement. Although it is easy to identify these two types of occurrences, game developers often find it difficult to determine their causes and triggers with so many game design choices and game parameters involved. In addition, the huge amounts of MOBA game data are often heterogeneous, multi-dimensional and highly dynamic in terms of space and time, which poses special challenges for analysts. In this paper, we present a visual analytics system to help game designers find key events and game parameters resulting in snowballing or comeback occurrences in MOBA game data. We follow a user-centered design process developing the system with game analysts and testing with real data of a trial version MOBA game from NetEase Inc. We apply novel visualization techniques in conjunction with well-established ones to depict the evolution of players' positions, status and the occurrences of events. Our system can reveal players' strategies and performance throughout a single match and suggest patterns, e.g., specific player' actions and game events, that have led to the final occurrences. We further demonstrate a workflow of leveraging human analyzed patterns to improve the scalability and generality of match data analysis. Finally, we validate the usability of our system by proving the identified patterns are representative in snowballing or comeback matches in a one-month-long MOBA tournament dataset.","article_number":"7534855","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7534855","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7534855/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7534855/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"211","end_page":"220","citing_paper_count":32,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2589,"insert_date":"20160805","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Games","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Gold","Market research","Pattern matching"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Game play data visualization","visual knowledge discovery","visual knowledge representation","and game reconstruction"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Visual System","Visualization Techniques","Occurrence Of Types","Player Performance","Game Design","Single Match","Player Development","Specific Players","Game Events","Interactive","Time Window","Video Games","Computer Games","Team Sports","Teammates","Domain Experts","Alternative Designs","Alternative Names","Internet Gaming","Online Games","Team Performance","Team Functioning","Tactical Actions","Gameplay","Player Position","Analysis Of Occurrence","Selected Time Period","Game Situations","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Individual Players","Amount Of Gold","Quantity Of Gold","Team Strategy"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2599017","title":"Jacobi Fiber Surfaces for Bivariate Reeb Space Computation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":51,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Sorbonne Universites, LIP6 UMR 7606, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37298870300","id":37298870300,"full_name":"Julien Tierny","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sorbonne Universites, LIP6 UMR 7606, France"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Leeds","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282624500","id":37282624500,"full_name":"Hamish Carr","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Leeds"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"This paper presents an efficient algorithm for the computation of the Reeb space of an input bivariate piecewise linear scalar function f defined on a tetrahedral mesh. By extending and generalizing algorithmic concepts from the univariate case to the bivariate one, we report the first practical, output-sensitive algorithm for the exact computation of such a Reeb space. The algorithm starts by identifying the Jacobi set of f, the bivariate analogs of critical points in the univariate case. Next, the Reeb space is computed by segmenting the input mesh along the new notion of Jacobi Fiber Surfaces, the bivariate analog of critical contours in the univariate case. We additionally present a simplification heuristic that enables the progressive coarsening of the Reeb space. Our algorithm is simple to implement and most of its computations can be trivially parallelized. We report performance numbers demonstrating orders of magnitude speedups over previous approaches, enabling for the first time the tractable computation of bivariate Reeb spaces in practice. Moreover, unlike range-based quantization approaches (such as the Joint Contour Net), our algorithm is parameter-free. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by using the Reeb space as a semi-automatic segmentation tool for bivariate data. In particular, we introduce continuous scatterplot peeling, a technique which enables the reduction of the cluttering in the continuous scatterplot, by interactively selecting the features of the Reeb space to project. We provide a VTK-based C++ implementation of our algorithm that can be used for reproduction purposes or for the development of new Reeb space based visualization techniques.","article_number":"7539583","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539583","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539583/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539583/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"960","end_page":"969","citing_paper_count":30,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":792,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Approximation algorithms","Data analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Level set","Jacobian matrices","Quantization (signal)"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Topological data analysis","multivariate data","data segmentation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Fiber Surface","Critical Point","Parallelization","Parallel Computing","Efficient Algorithm","Computational Algorithms","Calculation Algorithm","Visualization Techniques","Tetrahedral Mesh","Bivariate Function","Univariate Case","Bivariate Data","C++ Implementation","Cluttering","Computation Time","Calculation Time","Unique Set","Time Complexity","Implementation Of Algorithm","Region Of Domain","Multivariate Data","Multivariate Statistics","Line Segment","Topological Analysis","Topological Data Analysis","Bivariate Case","Breadth-first Search","Breadth-first","Fiber Components","Fibrous Components","Interaction Techniques","User-defined Parameters","Quadratic Complexity","Notion Of Space","Feature Tracking","Fast Computation","Fast Calculation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2599106","title":"Evaluating the Impact of Binning 2D Scalar Fields","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":52,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Psychology, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085907327","id":37085907327,"full_name":"Lace Padilla","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Psychology, University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Utah, School of Computing","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085624196","id":37085624196,"full_name":"P.

And yet, in many domains binning continuous data is not only pervasive, but it is accepted as standard practice. Prior work provides no clear guidance for when encoding continuous data continuously is preferable to employing binning techniques or how this choice affects data interpretation and decision making. In this paper, we present a study aimed at better understanding the conditions in which the expressiveness principle can or should be violated for visualizing continuous data. We provided participants with visualizations employing either continuous or binned greyscale encodings of geospatial elevation data and compared participants' ability to complete a wide variety of tasks. For various tasks, the results indicate significant differences in decision making, confidence in responses, and task completion time between continuous and binned encodings of the data. In general, participants with continuous encodings were faster to complete many of the tasks, but never outperformed those with binned encodings, while performance accuracy with binned encodings was superior to continuous encodings in some tasks. These findings suggest that strict adherence to the expressiveness principle is not always advisable. We discuss both the implications and limitations of our results and outline various avenues for potential work needed to further improve guidelines for using continuous versus binned encodings for continuous data types.","article_number":"7539585","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539585","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539585/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539585/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"431","end_page":"440","citing_paper_count":30,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":648,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Encoding","Data visualization","Image color analysis","Two dimensional displays","Decision making","Geospatial analysis","Guidelines"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Geographic/Geospatial Visualization","Qualitative Evaluation","Color Perception","Perceptual Cognition"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Continuous Data","Grayscale","Greyscale","Gray Level","Performance Accuracy","Task Completion Time","Continuous Channel","Related Data","Effective Technique","Spatial Memory","Spatial Working Memory","Spatial Learning","Digital Elevation Model","Digital Terrain Model","Digital Surface Model","Cartographic","Low Elevation","Highest Point","Color Map","Segmentation Task","Map Points","Confidence Ratings","Visual Working","Gradient Magnitude","Choropleth Maps","Highest Elevation","Error Score","Combination Of Tasks","Sobel Operator","Sobel Filter","Image Point","Confidence In Performance","Types Of Tasks","Color Difference","ENCODE Data"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2599058","title":"HindSight: Encouraging Exploration through Direct Encoding of Personal Interaction History","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":53,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Worcester Polytechnic Institute","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085354408","id":37085354408,"full_name":"Mi Feng","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Worcester Polytechnic Institute"]}},{"affiliation":"Worcester Polytechnic Institute","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085889192","id":37085889192,"full_name":"Cheng Deng","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Worcester Polytechnic Institute"]}},{"affiliation":"Bucknell University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085717352","id":37085717352,"full_name":"Evan M.

Website links turn purple after we visit them, for example, showing us information we have yet to explore. These “footprints” of interaction offer substantial benefits in information saturated environments - they enable us to easily revisit old information, systematically explore new information, and quickly resume tasks after interruption. While applying these design principles have been successful in HCI contexts, direct encodings of personal interaction history have received scarce attention in data visualization. One reason is that there is little guidance for integrating history into visualizations where many visual channels are already occupied by data. More importantly, there is not firm evidence that making users aware of their interaction history results in benefits with regards to exploration or insights. Following these observations, we propose HindSight - an umbrella term for the design space of representing interaction history directly in existing data visualizations. In this paper, we examine the value of HindSight principles by augmenting existing visualizations with visual indicators of user interaction history (e.g. How the Recession Shaped the Economy in 255 Charts, NYTimes). In controlled experiments of over 400 participants, we found that HindSight designs generally encouraged people to visit more data and recall different insights after interaction. The results of our experiments suggest that simple additions to visualizations can make users aware of their interaction history, and that these additions significantly impact users' exploration and insights.","article_number":"7539616","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539616","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539616/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539616/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"351","end_page":"360","citing_paper_count":28,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":955,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["History","Data visualization","Encoding","Visualization","Human computer interaction","Context","Data analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Interaction","History"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Personal History","Hindsight","Direct Encoding","Data Visualization","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Design Space","Visual Channels","Control Condition","Exploratory Analysis","Exploratory Data Analysis","Participants In Condition","Status Of Participants","Storytelling","Kind Of Information","Interactive Visualization","User Engagement","Customer Engagement","Exploration Phase","Exploration Time","Visual Design","Line Chart","Historical Representation","Visual Encoding","Behavioral Metrics","Interactive Data Visualization","Majority Agreement","Simple Visualization","Complete Disagreement","Yield Benefits","Complex Data","Partial Data","Perceptual System"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598542","title":"Small Multiples with Gaps","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":54,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"giCentre, City University, London","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073861100","id":37073861100,"full_name":"Wouter Meulemans","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["giCentre, City University, London"]}},{"affiliation":"giCentre, City University, London","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37605079900","id":37605079900,"full_name":"Jason Dykes","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["giCentre, City University, London"]}},{"affiliation":"giCentre, City University, London","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590960700","id":37590960700,"full_name":"Aidan Slingsby","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["giCentre, City University, London"]}},{"affiliation":"giCentre, City University, London","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37567685600","id":37567685600,"full_name":"Cagatay Turkay","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["giCentre, City University, London"]}},{"affiliation":"giCentre, City University, London","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399045100","id":37399045100,"full_name":"Jo Wood","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["giCentre, City University, London"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Small multiples enable comparison by providing different views of a single data set in a dense and aligned manner. A common frame defines each view, which varies based upon values of a conditioning variable. An increasingly popular use of this technique is to project two-dimensional locations into a gridded space (e.g. grid maps), using the underlying distribution both as the conditioning variable and to determine the grid layout. Using whitespace in this layout has the potential to carry information, especially in a geographic context. Yet, the effects of doing so on the spatial properties of the original units are not understood. We explore the design space offered by such small multiples with gaps. We do so by constructing a comprehensive suite of metrics that capture properties of the layout used to arrange the small multiples for comparison (e.g. compactness and alignment) and the preservation of the original data (e.g. distance, topology and shape). We study these metrics in geographic data sets with varying properties and numbers of gaps. We use simulated annealing to optimize for each metric and measure the effects on the others. To explore these effects systematically, we take a new approach, developing a system to visualize this design space using a set of interactive matrices. We find that adding small amounts of whitespace to small multiple arrays improves some of the characteristics of 2D layouts, such as shape, distance and direction. This comes at the cost of other metrics, such as the retention of topology. Effects vary according to the input maps, with degree of variation in size of input regions found to be a factor. Optima exist for particular metrics in many cases, but at different amounts of whitespace for different maps. We suggest multiple metrics be used in optimized layouts, finding topology to be a primary factor in existing manually-crafted solutions, followed by a trade-off between shape and displacement. But the rich range of possible optimized layouts leads us to challenge single-solution thinking; we suggest to consider alternative optimized layouts for small multiples with gaps. Key to our work is the systematic, quantified and visual approach to exploring design spaces when facing a trade-off between many competing criteria-an approach likely to be of value to the analysis of other design spaces.","article_number":"7536128","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7536128","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536128/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536128/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"381","end_page":"390","citing_paper_count":27,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1021,"insert_date":"20160808","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Measurement","Layout","Shape","Two dimensional displays","Topology","Space exploration"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Geographic visualization","small multiples","whitespace","design space","metrics","optimization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Design Space","Input Function","Input Maps","Grid Map","Layout Optimization","Centroid","Aspect Ratio","Small Region","Grid Cells","Range Of Characteristics","Range Of Features","Bounding Box","Regional Mapping","Material Online","Optimization Criteria","Optimization Criterion","Cardinal Directions","Compass Direction","Cardinal Points","Set Of Metrics","Project Characteristics","Feature Projection","Spatial Order","Topological Measures","Vertical Alignment","Array Of Targets","Horizontal Alignment","Symmetric Difference","Topological Metrics","Visual Encoding"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598471","title":"A Grammar-based Approach for Modeling User Interactions and Generating Suggestions During the Data Exploration Process","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":55,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"National Intrepid Center of Excellence, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, MD","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085617313","id":37085617313,"full_name":"Filip Dabek","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["National Intrepid Center of Excellence, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, MD"]}},{"affiliation":"National Intrepid Center of Excellence, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, MD","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37541275000","id":37541275000,"full_name":"Jesus J Caban","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["National Intrepid Center of Excellence, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, MD"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Despite the recent popularity of visual analytics focusing on big data, little is known about how to support users that use visualization techniques to explore multi-dimensional datasets and accomplish specific tasks. Our lack of models that can assist end-users during the data exploration process has made it challenging to learn from the user's interactive and analytical process. The ability to model how a user interacts with a specific visualization technique and what difficulties they face are paramount in supporting individuals with discovering new patterns within their complex datasets. This paper introduces the notion of visualization systems understanding and modeling user interactions with the intent of guiding a user through a task thereby enhancing visual data exploration. The challenges faced and the necessary future steps to take are discussed; and to provide a working example, a grammar-based model is presented that can learn from user interactions, determine the common patterns among a number of subjects using a K-Reversible algorithm, build a set of rules, and apply those rules in the form of suggestions to new users with the goal of guiding them along their visual analytic process. A formal evaluation study with 300 subjects was performed showing that our grammar-based model is effective at capturing the interactive process followed by users and that further research in this area has the potential to positively impact how users interact with a visualization system.","article_number":"7534759","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7534759","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7534759/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7534759/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"41","end_page":"50","citing_paper_count":27,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1985,"insert_date":"20160805","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Data models","Automata","Computational modeling","Analytical models","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analytics","User Interactions","Analytic Provenance","Machine Learning"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Exploratory Data","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Specific Tasks","Visual System","Visual Processing","Visual Analysis","Interactive Process","Set Of Rules","Formal Rules","Complex Datasets","Visualization Techniques","Understanding Of The Notion","Machine Learning","Open-ended Questions","User Study","State Machine","Finite-state","Finite State Machine","Information Overload","Majority Of Users","Final Graph","Number Of Suggestions","User Performance","Low Levels Of Interaction","Lower-level Interactions","Probable Path","Linear Graph","Path Graph","Confidence Ratings","Similar Path","US Census Bureau","Levenshtein Distance"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598465","title":"NameClarifier: A Visual Analytics System for Author Name Disambiguation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":56,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085634001","id":37085634001,"full_name":"Qiaomu Shen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085769514","id":37085769514,"full_name":"Tongshuang Wu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085374359","id":37085374359,"full_name":"Haiyan Yang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085523487","id":37085523487,"full_name":"Yanhong Wu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37391623900","id":37391623900,"full_name":"Weiwei Cui","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel visual analytics system called NameClarifier to interactively disambiguate author names in publications by keeping humans in the loop. Specifically, NameClarifier quantifies and visualizes the similarities between ambiguous names and those that have been confirmed in digital libraries. The similarities are calculated using three key factors, namely, co-authorships, publication venues, and temporal information. Our system estimates all possible allocations, and then provides visual cues to users to help them validate every ambiguous case. By looping users in the disambiguation process, our system can achieve more reliable results than general data mining models for highly ambiguous cases. In addition, once an ambiguous case is resolved, the result is instantly added back to our system and serves as additional cues for all the remaining unidentified names. In this way, we open up the black box in traditional disambiguation processes, and help intuitively and comprehensively explain why the corresponding classifications should hold. We conducted two use cases and an expert review to demonstrate the effectiveness of NameClarifier.","article_number":"7534824","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7534824","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7534824/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7534824/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"141","end_page":"150","citing_paper_count":26,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1607,"insert_date":"20160805","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Libraries","Metadata","Algorithm design and analysis","Uncertainty","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Name disambiguation","analytical reasoning"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Name Of Author","Author Name Disambiguation","Author Disambiguation","Visual System","Visual Cues","Digital Library","Virtual Library","Digital Repository","Online Library","Public Venues","Human-in-the-loop","Ambiguous Cases","Name Of Publication","Year Of Publication","Metadata","Number Of Papers","Visual Feedback","Video Feedback","Similar Research","Visual Display","High Saturation","Bibliographic Databases","Iterative Refinement","Visual Design","Red Border","Public Record","Chinese Name"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598472","title":"Blockwise Human Brain Network Visual Comparison Using NodeTrix Representation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":57,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Imaging Genetics Center, University of Southern California","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085886017","id":37085886017,"full_name":"Xinsong Yang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Imaging Genetics Center, University of Southern California","Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Software"]}},{"affiliation":"Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Software","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085394737","id":37085394737,"full_name":"Lei Shi","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Software"]}},{"affiliation":"Imaging Genetics Center, University of Southern California","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38263661400","id":38263661400,"full_name":"Madelaine Daianu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Imaging Genetics Center, University of Southern California"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computing, Informatics and Decision Systems Engineering, Arizona State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085382649","id":37085382649,"full_name":"Hanghang Tong","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computing, Informatics and Decision Systems Engineering, Arizona State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Software","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089401634","id":37089401634,"full_name":"Qingsong Liu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Software"]}},{"affiliation":"Imaging Genetics Center, University of Southern California","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271830100","id":37271830100,"full_name":"Paul Thompson","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Imaging Genetics Center, University of Southern California"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Visually comparing human brain networks from multiple population groups serves as an important task in the field of brain connectomics. The commonly used brain network representation, consisting of nodes and edges, may not be able to reveal the most compelling network differences when the reconstructed networks are dense and homogeneous. In this paper, we leveraged the block information on the Region Of Interest (ROI) based brain networks and studied the problem of blockwise brain network visual comparison. An integrated visual analytics framework was proposed. In the first stage, a two-level ROI block hierarchy was detected by optimizing the anatomical structure and the predictive comparison performance simultaneously. In the second stage, the NodeTrix representation was adopted and customized to visualize the brain network with block information. We conducted controlled user experiments and case studies to evaluate our proposed solution. Results indicated that our visual analytics method outperformed the commonly used node-link graph and adjacency matrix design in the blockwise network comparison tasks. We have shown compelling findings from two real-world brain network data sets, which are consistent with the prior connectomics studies.","article_number":"7534826","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7534826","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7534826/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7534826/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"181","end_page":"190","citing_paper_count":26,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1029,"insert_date":"20160805","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Diffusion tensor imaging","Data visualization","Visual analytics","Diseases","Sociology"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Brain Network","Visual Comparison","Hybrid Representation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Brain Tissue","Human Brain","Brain Networks","Visual Network","Network Diagram","Visual Comparison","Human Brain Networks","Population Groups","Real-world Data","Visual Methods","Design Matrix","Design Matrices","Real-world Datasets","Connectome","Network Comparison","Comparative Network","Real-world Networks","Problem Of Comparisons","Comparison Task","Visual Framework","Classification Accuracy","Frontal Cortex","Frontal Lobe","Frontal Cortices","Temporal Lobe","Temporal Cortices","Temporal Regions","Temporal Cortex","User Experience","Visual Design","Block Level","Functional Blocks","Left Hemisphere","Diagnostic Groups","Synthetic Networks","Fiber Tracts","Fiber Pathways","Control Points","Connectivity Patterns","Edge Features"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598466","title":"Visualizing Dimension Coverage to Support Exploratory Analysis","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":58,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Victoria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591344300","id":37591344300,"full_name":"Ali Sarvghad","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Victoria"]}},{"affiliation":"Tableau Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275861300","id":37275861300,"full_name":"Melanie Tory","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tableau Research"]}},{"affiliation":"University of British Columbia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591344800","id":37591344800,"full_name":"Narges Mahyar","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of British Columbia"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Data analysis involves constantly formulating and testing new hypotheses and questions about data. When dealing with a new dataset, especially one with many dimensions, it can be cumbersome for the analyst to clearly remember which aspects of the data have been investigated (i.e., visually examined for patterns, trends, outliers etc.) and which combinations have not. Yet this information is critical to help the analyst formulate new questions that they have not already answered. We observe that for tabular data, questions are typically comprised of varying combinations of data dimensions (e.g., what are the trends of Sales and Profit for different Regions?). We propose representing analysis history from the angle of dimension coverage (i.e., which data dimensions have been investigated and in which combinations). We use scented widgets to incorporate dimension coverage of the analysts' past work into interaction widgets of a visualization tool. We demonstrate how this approach can assist analysts with the question formation process. Our approach extends the concept of scented widgets to reveal aspects of one's own analysis history, and offers a different perspective on one's past work than typical visualization history tools. Results of our empirical study showed that participants with access to embedded dimension coverage information relied on this information when formulating questions, asked more questions about the data, generated more top-level findings, and showed greater breadth of their analysis without sacrificing depth.","article_number":"7534787","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7534787","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7534787/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7534787/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"21","end_page":"30","citing_paper_count":25,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1148,"insert_date":"20160805","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["History","Data visualization","Visualization","Data analysis","Navigation","Prototypes","Market research"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Dimension coverage","Tabular data","History","Empirical laboratory study","Exploratory data analysis","Scented widgets"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Exploratory Analysis","Exploratory Data Analysis","Visualization Tool","Past Work","Question Format","Aspects Of The Data","Coverage Information","Combination Of Dimensions","Prototype","Type Of Analysis","System State","Utterances","User Study","Visual Analysis","Number Of Findings","Number Of Discoveries","Determination Of Number","Baseline Condition","Baseline Status","Baseline State","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Questionnaire Results","Outcome Questionnaire","Analysis Tasks","Product Categories","Visual Analytics Tool","Past Conditions","Past States","Visual Analysis Of Data","Visual Encoding","New Lines Of Research","New Lines Of Enquiry","Interface Elements","User Interface Elements","Exploration Task","Value Dimensions","None Of The Participants","Bar Length"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598467","title":"Magnostics: Image-Based Search of Interesting Matrix Views for Guided Network Exploration","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":59,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38551542600","id":38551542600,"full_name":"Michael Behrisch","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research-Inria Joint Centre, Saclay, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085687578","id":37085687578,"full_name":"Benjamin Bach","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research-Inria Joint Centre, Saclay, France"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085899690","id":37085899690,"full_name":"Michael Hund","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085904402","id":37085904402,"full_name":"Michael Delz","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Capgemini, RWTH Aachen University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085906324","id":37085906324,"full_name":"Laura Von Rüden","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Capgemini, RWTH Aachen University"]}},{"affiliation":"Inria, Saclay, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407972900","id":37407972900,"full_name":"Jean-Daniel Fekete","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Inria, Saclay, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Graz University of Technology, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282557600","id":37282557600,"full_name":"Tobias Schreck","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Graz University of Technology, Austria"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this work we address the problem of retrieving potentially interesting matrix views to support the exploration of networks.

Our approach ranks matrix views according to the appearance of specific visual patterns, such as blocks and lines, indicating the existence of topological motifs in the data, such as clusters, bi-graphs, or central nodes. Magnostics can be used to analyze, query, or search for visually similar matrices in large collections, or to assess the quality of matrix reordering algorithms. While many feature descriptors for image analyzes exist, there is no evidence how they perform for detecting patterns in matrices. In order to make an informed choice of feature descriptors for matrix diagnostics, we evaluate 30 feature descriptors-27 existing ones and three new descriptors that we designed specifically for MAGNOSTICS-with respect to four criteria: pattern response, pattern variability, pattern sensibility, and pattern discrimination. We conclude with an informed set of six descriptors as most appropriate for Magnostics and demonstrate their application in two scenarios; exploring a large collection of matrices and analyzing temporal networks.","article_number":"7534849","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7534849","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7534849/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7534849/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"31","end_page":"40","citing_paper_count":25,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1031,"insert_date":"20160805","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Data visualization","Feature extraction","Symmetric matrices","Data analysis","Layout","Density measurement"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Matrix Visualization","Visual Quality Measures","Quality Metrics","Feature Detection/Selection","Relational Data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Scatter Plot","Descriptive Characteristics","Feature Descriptors","Large Collection","Visual Patterns","Discriminative Patterns","Large Datasets","Patterns Of Variation","Column Vector","Column Of Matrix","Local Patterns","Precision And Recall","Benchmark Datasets","Cell Matrix","Line Of Work","Binary Matrix","Binary Matrices","Textual Descriptions","Translation Invariance","Translational Symmetry","Monotonic Increase","Search Task","N-dimensional Vector","Plot Points","Points In Each Plot","Matrix Plot","Off-diagonal Blocks","Noise Matrix","Noise Matrices","Salient Patterns","Degenerate Levels","Amount Of Noise","Interactive","Informal Networks","Pairwise Distances"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2599214","title":"Categorical Colormap Optimization with Visualization Case Studies","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":60,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Edge Hill University, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086824713","id":37086824713,"full_name":"H.

Users of visualization software routinely rely on the default colormaps provided by a system, or colormaps suggested by software such as ColorBrewer. In practice, users often have to select a set of colors in a semantically meaningful way (e.g., based on conventions, color metaphors, and logological associations), and consequently would like to ensure their perceptual differentiation is optimized. In this paper, we present an algorithmic approach for maximizing the perceptual distances among a set of given colors. We address two technical problems in optimization, i.e., (i) the phenomena of local maxima that halt the optimization too soon, and (ii) the arbitrary reassignment of colors that leads to the loss of the original semantic association. We paid particular attention to different types of constraints that users may wish to impose during the optimization process. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this work, we tested this technique in two case studies. To reach out to a wider range of users, we also developed a web application called Colourmap Hospital.","article_number":"7539556","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539556","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539556/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539556/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"871","end_page":"880","citing_paper_count":25,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1296,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image color analysis","Color","Optimization","Data visualization","Visualization","Extraterrestrial measurements"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Color","categorical colormap","optimization","seismological data visualization","London tube map"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Color Map","Semantic","Metaphor","Optimization Process","Types Of Constraints","Distance Perception","Computational Cost","Optimization Algorithm","Seismic","Earthquake","Minimum Distance","Distance Function","Fitness Function","Color Difference","Color Space","Color Components","Domain Experts","Visual Search","Visual Scanning","Constrained Optimization","Optimization Constraints","Constrained Minimization","Depth Values","Indiscernible","Nelder-Mead Algorithm","Nelder-Mead Simplex Method","Downhill Simplex","Nelder Mead Method","Uniform Spacing","General Optimization","Visual Channels","Individual Constraints","Visual Design","Ith Iteration"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598543","title":"Annotation Graphs: A Graph-Based Visualization for Meta-Analysis of Data Based on User-Authored Annotations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":61,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Autodesk Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38024987300","id":38024987300,"full_name":"Jian Zhao","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Autodesk Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Autodesk Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085739236","id":37085739236,"full_name":"Michael Glueck","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Autodesk Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Autodesk Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085723416","id":37085723416,"full_name":"Simon Breslav","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Autodesk Research"]}},{"affiliation":"INRIA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37395495900","id":37395495900,"full_name":"Fanny Chevalier","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["INRIA"]}},{"affiliation":"Autodesk Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085722798","id":37085722798,"full_name":"Azam Khan","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Autodesk Research"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"User-authored annotations of data can support analysts in the activity of hypothesis generation and sensemaking, where it is not only critical to document key observations, but also to communicate insights between analysts.

Using these groups as the unit of analysis not only reduces the data volume, but also allows detecting various patterns in the data. This involves analyzing intersection relations between these groups, and how the element attributes vary between these intersections. This kind of set-based analysis has various applications in a variety of domains, due to the generic and powerful notion of sets. However, visualizing intersections relations is challenging because their number grows exponentially with the number of sets. We present a novel technique based on Treemaps to provide a comprehensive overview of non-empty intersections in a set system in a scalable way.

Traditional curricula that focused on conveying research-derived knowledge are slowly integrating design thinking as a key learning objective. In part, this is motivated by the realization that infovis is a wicked design problem, requiring a different kind of design work. In this paper we describe, VizItCards, a card-driven workshop developed for our graduate infovis class. The workshop is intended to provide practice with good design techniques and to simultaneously reinforce key concepts. VizItCards relies on principles of collaborative-learning and research on parallel design to generate positive collaborations and high-quality designs. From our experience of simulating a realistic design scenario in a classroom setting, we find that our students were able to meet key learning objectives and their design performance improved during the class. We describe variants of the workshop, discussing which techniques we think match to which learning goals.","article_number":"7539629","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539629","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539629/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539629/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"561","end_page":"570","citing_paper_count":22,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1137,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Conferences","Collaboration","Visualization","Education","Data visualization","Human computer interaction","Standards"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["information visualization education","peer learning","toolkit","card","design workshop"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Information","Learning Objectives","Wicked Problems","Design Thinking","Lecture","Design Process","Teaching Staff","Staff Education","Domain Experts","Alternative Designs","Alternative Names","Design Decisions","Workshop Participants","Solution Group","Peer Learning","Collaborative Design","Graduate Courses","Feedback Survey","Design Pipeline","Design Workshops","Blank Sheet","High-level Design","Higher-level Design","University Of Michigan","Workflow"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598795","title":"Combined Visualization of Vessel Deformation and Hemodynamics in Cerebral Aneurysms","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":65,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085898826","id":37085898826,"full_name":"Monique Meuschke","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Magdeburg, Germany","Research Campus STIMULATE"]}},{"affiliation":"Research Campus STIMULATE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085906014","id":37085906014,"full_name":"Samuel Voss","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Research Campus STIMULATE","University of Magdeburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Research Campus STIMULATE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017002900","id":38017002900,"full_name":"Oliver Beuing","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Research Campus STIMULATE","University of Magdeburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Research Campus STIMULATE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37424645300","id":37424645300,"full_name":"Bernhard Preim","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Research Campus STIMULATE","University of Magdeburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Koblenz-Landau, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085527253","id":37085527253,"full_name":"Kai Lawonn","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Koblenz-Landau, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present the first visualization tool that combines patient-specific hemodynamics with information about the vessel wall deformation and wall thickness in cerebral aneurysms. Such aneurysms bear the risk of rupture, whereas their treatment also carries considerable risks for the patient. For the patient-specific rupture risk evaluation and treatment analysis, both morphological and hemodynamic data have to be investigated. Medical researchers emphasize the importance of analyzing correlations between wall properties such as the wall deformation and thickness, and hemodynamic attributes like the Wall Shear Stress and near-wall flow. Our method uses a linked 2.5D and 3D depiction of the aneurysm together with blood flow information that enables the simultaneous exploration of wall characteristics and hemodynamic attributes during the cardiac cycle. We thus offer medical researchers an effective visual exploration tool for aneurysm treatment risk assessment. The 2.5D view serves as an overview that comprises a projection of the vessel surface to a 2D map, providing an occlusion-free surface visualization combined with a glyph-based depiction of the local wall thickness. The 3D view represents the focus upon which the data exploration takes place. To support the time-dependent parameter exploration and expert collaboration, a camera path is calculated automatically, where the user can place landmarks for further exploration of the properties. We developed a GPU-based implementation of our visualizations with a flexible interactive data exploration mechanism. We designed our techniques in collaboration with domain experts, and provide details about the evaluation.","article_number":"7539321","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539321","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539321/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539321/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"761","end_page":"770","citing_paper_count":22,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":633,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Aneurysm","Hemodynamics","Data visualization","Blood","Three-dimensional displays","Surface morphology","Two dimensional displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Medical visualizations","aneurysms","blood flow","wall thickness","wall deformation","projections"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Blood Flow","Hemodynamic","Cerebral Aneurysms","Interactive","Risk Assessment","Wall Thickness","Information Flow","Vessel Wall","Exploratory Data","Visualization Tool","Domain Experts","Cardiac Cycle","Wall Shear Stress","Surface Vessels","Wall Deformation","Time Step","Years Of Experience","Inner Wall","Anterior Wall","Outer Wall","Lateral Wall","Bar Charts","Hemodynamic Parameters","Pathlines","Fluid-structure Interaction","Fluid Domain","Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm","Abdominal Aneurysm","Morphological Information","Axial Stress","Wall Tension","Circumferential Stress","Solid Domain","3D Visualization","Years Of Work Experience","Vessel Morphology"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598826","title":"PelVis: Atlas-based Surgical Planning for Oncological Pelvic Surgery","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":66,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Delft University of Technology, University of Bergen","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085904230","id":37085904230,"full_name":"Noeska Smit","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Delft University of Technology, University of Bergen"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Koblenz, Landau","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085527253","id":37085527253,"full_name":"Kai Lawonn","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Koblenz, Landau"]}},{"affiliation":"Leiden University Medical Center","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085902741","id":37085902741,"full_name":"Annelot Kraima","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Leiden University Medical Center"]}},{"affiliation":"Leiden University Medical Center","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085904697","id":37085904697,"full_name":"Marco DeRuiter","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Leiden University Medical Center"]}},{"affiliation":"Leiden University Medical Center","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085900813","id":37085900813,"full_name":"Hessam Sokooti","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Leiden University Medical Center"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Bergen","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37265895700","id":37265895700,"full_name":"Stefan Bruckner","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bergen"]}},{"affiliation":"Delft University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37829332900","id":37829332900,"full_name":"Elmar Eisemann","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Delft University of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Delft University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282551500","id":37282551500,"full_name":"Anna Vilanova","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Delft University of Technology"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Due to the intricate relationship between the pelvic organs and vital structures, such as vessels and nerves, pelvic anatomy is often considered to be complex to comprehend. In oncological pelvic surgery, a trade-off has to be made between complete tumor resection and preserving function by preventing damage to the nerves. Damage to the autonomic nerves causes undesirable post-operative side-effects such as fecal and urinal incontinence, as well as sexual dysfunction in up to 80 percent of the cases. Since these autonomic nerves are not visible in pre-operative MRI scans or during surgery, avoiding nerve damage during such a surgical procedure becomes challenging. In this work, we present visualization methods to represent context, target, and risk structures for surgical planning. We employ distance-based and occlusion management techniques in an atlas-based surgical planning tool for oncological pelvic surgery. Patient-specific pre-operative MRI scans are registered to an atlas model that includes nerve information. Through several interactive linked views, the spatial relationships and distances between the organs, tumor and risk zones are visualized to improve understanding, while avoiding occlusion. In this way, the surgeon can examine surgically relevant structures and plan the procedure before going into the operating theater, thus raising awareness of the autonomic nerve zone regions and potentially reducing post-operative complications. Furthermore, we present the results of a domain expert evaluation with surgical oncologists that demonstrates the advantages of our approach.","article_number":"7539313","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539313","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539313/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539313/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"741","end_page":"750","citing_paper_count":21,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":577,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Surgery","Planning","Visualization","Tumors","Magnetic resonance imaging","Context","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Atlas","surgical planning","medical visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Oncology","Surgical Planning","Interactive","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scans","Visual Methods","Domain Experts","Sexual Dysfunction","Fecal Incontinence","Bowel Incontinence","Anal Incontinence","Autonomic Nerve","Pelvic Organ","Vital Structures","Surgical Tools","Risk Zones","Pelvic Anatomy","Prostate Cancer","Isothermal","Contour Plots","Recurrence Rate","Local Recurrence","Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data","Circumferential Margin","Total Mesorectal Excision","Rectal Cancer","Visual Encoding","Registration Process","Enrollment Process","Color Map","Local Recurrence Rate","Spatial Context","Abdominoperineal Resection","Abdominal Perineal Resection","Abdominoperineal Excision","Surface Shape"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598796","title":"GazeDx: Interactive Visual Analytics Framework for Comparative Gaze Analysis with Volumetric Medical Images","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":67,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Seoul National University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085891396","id":37085891396,"full_name":"Hyunjoo Song","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Seoul National University"]}},{"affiliation":"Soongsil University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37310719500","id":37310719500,"full_name":"Jeongjin Lee","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Soongsil University"]}},{"affiliation":"Samsung Medical Center","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085890689","id":37085890689,"full_name":"Tae Jung Kim","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Samsung Medical Center"]}},{"affiliation":"Bundang Hospital, Seoul National University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38253903000","id":38253903000,"full_name":"Kyoung Ho Lee","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Bundang Hospital, Seoul National University"]}},{"affiliation":"Hankuk University of Foreign Studies","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37594632900","id":37594632900,"full_name":"Bohyoung Kim","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hankuk University of Foreign Studies"]}},{"affiliation":"Seoul National University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37422552700","id":37422552700,"full_name":"Jinwook Seo","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Seoul National University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present an interactive visual analytics framework, GazeDx (abbr. of GazeDiagnosis), for the comparative analysis of gaze data from multiple readers examining volumetric images while integrating important contextual information with the gaze data. Gaze pattern comparison is essential to understanding how radiologists examine medical images, and to identifying factors influencing the examination. Most prior work depended upon comparisons with manually juxtaposed static images of gaze tracking results. Comparative gaze analysis with volumetric images is more challenging due to the additional cognitive load on 3D perception. A recent study proposed a visualization design based on direct volume rendering (DVR) for visualizing gaze patterns in volumetric images; however, effective and comprehensive gaze pattern comparison is still challenging due to a lack of interactive visualization tools for comparative gaze analysis. We take the challenge with GazeDx while integrating crucial contextual information such as pupil size and windowing into the analysis process for more in-depth and ecologically valid findings. Among the interactive visualization components in GazeDx, a context-embedded interactive scatterplot is especially designed to help users examine abstract gaze data in diverse contexts by embedding medical imaging representations well known to radiologists in it. We present the results from two case studies with two experienced radiologists, where they compared the gaze patterns of 14 radiologists reading two patients' volumetric CT images.","article_number":"7539334","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539334","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539334/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539334/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"311","end_page":"320","citing_paper_count":20,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1045,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three-dimensional displays","Data visualization","Gaze tracking","Medical diagnostic imaging","Visualization","Two dimensional displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Eye tracking","gaze visualization","gaze pattern comparison","volumetric medical images","context-embedded interactive scatterplot","interactive temporal chart"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Comparative Analysis","Comparison Analysis","Medical Imaging","Clinical Imaging","Diagnostic Imaging","Visual Analysis","Interactive Visualization","Interactive Framework","Visual Framework","Gaze Analysis","Interactive Visual Analysis","Volumetric Medical Images","Visual Analytics Framework","Computed Tomography","Computed Tomography Scan","CT Scan","Important Information","Contextual Information","Eye-tracking","Ecological Validity","Pupil Size","Pupil Dilation","Mydriasis","Static Images","Multiple Readings","Volumetric Imaging","Gaze Points","Window Settings","Expert Radiologists","Interactive Charts","Scan Paths","Image Stacks","Cross-sectional Images","Scrolling","Multidimensional Data","Multidimensional Analysis","Eye-tracking Studies"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598518","title":"booc.io: An Education System with Hierarchical Concept Maps and Dynamic Non-linear Learning Plans","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":68,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Harvard Paulson SEAS","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085898951","id":37085898951,"full_name":"Michail Schwab","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard Paulson SEAS"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard Paulson SEAS","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38108845300","id":38108845300,"full_name":"Hendrik Strobelt","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard Paulson SEAS"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard Paulson SEAS","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38234180400","id":38234180400,"full_name":"James Tompkin","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard Paulson SEAS"]}},{"affiliation":"HarvardX","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088720161","id":37088720161,"full_name":"Colin Fredericks","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["HarvardX"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088720289","id":37088720289,"full_name":"Connor Huff","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088720509","id":37088720509,"full_name":"Dana Higgins","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088718416","id":37088718416,"full_name":"Anton Strezhnev","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088716086","id":37088716086,"full_name":"Mayya Komisarchik","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087271002","id":37087271002,"full_name":"Gary King","author_order":9,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard Paulson SEAS","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275698100","id":37275698100,"full_name":"Hanspeter Pfister","author_order":10,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard Paulson SEAS"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Information hierarchies are difficult to express when real-world space or time constraints force traversing the hierarchy in linear presentations, such as in educational books and classroom courses.

Advances in solver technologies over recent years have allowed the successful use of constraint programming in many application areas. However, when a particular solver's search for a solution takes too long, the complexity of the constraint program execution hinders the programmer's ability to profile that search and understand how it relates to their model. Therefore, effective tools to support such profiling and allow users of constraint programming technologies to refine their model or experiment with different search parameters are essential. This paper details the first user-centred design process for visual profiling tools in this domain. We report on: our insights and opportunities identified through an on-line questionnaire and a creativity workshop with domain experts carried out to elicit requirements for analytical and visual profiling techniques; our designs and functional prototypes realising such techniques; and case studies demonstrating how these techniques shed light on the behaviour of the solvers in practice.","article_number":"7536109","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7536109","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536109/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536109/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"281","end_page":"290","citing_paper_count":19,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":897,"insert_date":"20160808","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Programming","Search problems","Computational modeling","Conferences","Prototypes","Creativity"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["visual analytics","user-centred design","profiling","constraint programming","tree visualisations"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Constraint Programming","Application Areas","Visualization Tool","User-centered","Human-centered Design","User-centered Design","Profiling Techniques","Search Strategy","Visual Representation","Types Of Tasks","Wider Community","Mental Models","Subtree","Model Constraints","Tree Search","Pattern Search","Number Of Decisions","Current Profile","Vehicle Routing","Decision Level","Program Behavior","Tree Visualization","Tree Representation","Large Instances","Visualization Library","Alternative Tree","Search Space","Visual Design","Boolean Variable","Boolean Value","Chain Length"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598469","title":"PhenoStacks: Cross-Sectional Cohort Phenotype Comparison Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":70,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Autodesk Research, University of Toronto","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085739236","id":37085739236,"full_name":"Michael Glueck","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Autodesk Research, University of Toronto"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Toronto","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085890521","id":37085890521,"full_name":"Alina Gvozdik","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Toronto"]}},{"affiliation":"Inria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37395495900","id":37395495900,"full_name":"Fanny Chevalier","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Inria"]}},{"affiliation":"Autodesk Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085722798","id":37085722798,"full_name":"Azam Khan","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Autodesk Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085722488","id":37085722488,"full_name":"Michael Brudno","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Toronto","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37870405500","id":37870405500,"full_name":"Daniel Wigdor","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Toronto"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Cross-sectional phenotype studies are used by genetics researchers to better understand how phenotypes vary across patients with genetic diseases, both within and between cohorts. Analyses within cohorts identify patterns between phenotypes and patients (e.g., co-occurrence) and isolate special cases (e.g., potential outliers). Comparing the variation of phenotypes between two cohorts can help distinguish how different factors affect disease manifestation (e.g., causal genes, age of onset, etc.). PhenoStacks is a novel visual analytics tool that supports the exploration of phenotype variation within and between cross-sectional patient cohorts. By leveraging the semantic hierarchy of the Human Phenotype Ontology, phenotypes are presented in context, can be grouped and clustered, and are summarized via overviews to support the exploration of phenotype distributions. The design of PhenoStacks was motivated by formative interviews with genetics researchers: we distil high-level tasks, present an algorithm for simplifying ontology topologies for visualization, and report the results of a deployment evaluation with four expert genetics researchers. The results suggest that PhenoStacks can help identify phenotype patterns, investigate data quality issues, and inform data collection design.","article_number":"7534774","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7534774","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7534774/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7534774/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"191","end_page":"200","citing_paper_count":19,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":872,"insert_date":"20160805","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Diseases","Ontologies","Data visualization","Genomics","Visualization","Interviews"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Cross-sectional cohort analysis","Phenotypes","Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Cross-sectional Cohort","Cohort Of Patients","Data Quality","Age Of Onset","Age At Onset","Visualization Tool","Genetic Research","Distribution Of Phenotypes","Human Phenotype Ontology","Visual Analytics Tool","Inflammatory Bowel Disease","Colitis","Rare Disease","Information Content","Surprisal","Longitudinal Analysis","Patterns In Data","Phenotypic Data","Specific Phenotypes","Leaf Node","Phenotypic Observations","Detailed Phenotyping","Audit Data","Human Phenotype Ontology Terms","Congenital Form","Phenotype Terms","Phenylketonuria","Deployment Period","Intermediate Category","Myotonic Dystrophy","Sort Order","Metrics Of Interest","Common Tasks"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598586","title":"Exploring the Possibilities of Embedding Heterogeneous Data Attributes in Familiar Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":71,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085698406","id":37085698406,"full_name":"Mona Hosseinkhani Loorak","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Calgary"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077505300","id":37077505300,"full_name":"Charles Perin","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Calgary"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Ontario","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37669874100","id":37669874100,"full_name":"Christopher Collins","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Ontario"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37285000100","id":37285000100,"full_name":"Sheelagh Carpendale","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Calgary"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Heterogeneous multi-dimensional data are now sufficiently common that they can be referred to as ubiquitous.

We demonstrate how HEDA is a generic, interactive visualization component that can extend common visualization techniques while respecting the structure of the familiar layout. HEDA is a tabular visualization building block that enables individuals to visually observe, explore, and query their familiar visualizations through manipulation of embedded multivariate data. We describe the design space of HEDA by exploring its application to familiar visualizations in the D3 gallery. We characterize these familiar visualizations by the extent to which HEDA can facilitate data queries based on attribute reordering.","article_number":"7536142","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7536142","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536142/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536142/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"581","end_page":"590","citing_paper_count":18,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1091,"insert_date":"20160808","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Layout","Visualization","Space exploration","Context","Joining processes","Encoding"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Multi-dimensional data","Hybrid visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Heterogeneous Data","Data Heterogeneity","Multidimensional Data","Multidimensional Analysis","Design Space","Visualization Techniques","Interactive Visualization","Visual Components","Query Data","Ordinal Scale","Ordinal Variables","Ordinal Data","Dimensional Data","Binary Data","Binary Values","Additional Properties","Additional Attributes","Additional Dimension","Bar Charts","Domain Experts","Temporal Data","Pie Chart","Nominal Data","Single View","Interaction Techniques","Tree Visualization","Categorical Attributes","Classification Properties","Attribute Classification","Parallel Coordinates","Representation Of Entities","Law Firms","Properties Of Entities","Attributes Of Entities","Bar Size","Scatterplot Matrix","Scatterplot Matrices","Sankey Diagram","Sankey Plot","Visual Representation","Real-world Datasets","Treemap","Functional Tree","Performance Of Trees"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598866","title":"Decal-Maps: Real-Time Layering of Decals on Surfaces for Multivariate Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":72,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085906508","id":37085906508,"full_name":"Allan Rocha","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085906267","id":37085906267,"full_name":"Usman Alim","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085898404","id":37085898404,"full_name":"Julio Daniel Silva","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267488200","id":37267488200,"full_name":"Mario Costa Sousa","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We introduce the use of decals for multivariate visualization design.

In this work, we adapt Bayesian surprise to generate maps that counter these biases. Bayesian surprise, which has shown promise for modeling human visual attention, weights information with respect to how it updates beliefs over a space of models. We introduce Surprise Maps, a visualization technique that weights event data relative to a set of spatia-temporal models. Unexpected events (those that induce large changes in belief over the model space) are visualized more prominently than those that follow expected patterns. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate how Surprise Maps overcome some limitations of traditional event maps.","article_number":"7536212","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7536212","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536212/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536212/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"651","end_page":"660","citing_paper_count":18,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1127,"insert_date":"20160808","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Bayes methods","Sociology","Statistics","Visualization","Data models","Spatial databases"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Thematic Maps","Bayesian Surprise","Event Visualization","Spatia-temporal data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Population Density","Set Of Models","Event Data","Effective Data","Basal Rate","Effect Of Density","Space Model","Real-world Datasets","Thematic Map","Traditional Mapping","Spatial Patterns","Spatiotemporal Patterns","Temporal Patterns","Posterior Probability","Posterior Distribution","Bayesian Model","Bayesian Approach","Bayesian Network","Seismic","Earthquake","Variation In Density","Density Map","Spatial Model","Gaussian Model","Kullback-Leibler","Relative Entropy","Kullback Leibler Divergence","KL Divergence","Population Model","Spatial Module","Choropleth Maps","Spatial Regions","Uniform Model","Varicella","Chickenpox","Temporal Component","Update Step","Open Challenges","Belief Updating","Temporal Model","Renormalization","Self-interaction"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2599049","title":"GlyphLens: View-Dependent Occlusion Management in the Interactive Glyph Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":74,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"The Ohio State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38529158400","id":38529158400,"full_name":"Xin Tong","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The Ohio State University"]}},{"affiliation":"The Ohio State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37383584500","id":37383584500,"full_name":"Cheng Li","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The Ohio State University"]}},{"affiliation":"The Ohio State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279493500","id":37279493500,"full_name":"Han-Wei Shen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The Ohio State University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Glyph as a powerful multivariate visualization technique is used to visualize data through its visual channels. To visualize 3D volumetric dataset, glyphs are usually placed on 2D surface, such as the slicing plane or the feature surface, to avoid occluding each other. However, the 3D spatial structure of some features may be missing. On the other hand, placing large number of glyphs over the entire 3D space results in occlusion and visual clutter that make the visualization ineffective. To avoid the occlusion, we propose a view-dependent interactive 3D lens that removes the occluding glyphs by pulling the glyphs aside through the animation. We provide two space deformation models and two lens shape models to displace the glyphs based on their spatial distributions. After the displacement, the glyphs around the user-interested region are still visible as the context information, and their spatial structures are preserved. Besides, we attenuate the brightness of the glyphs inside the lens based on their depths to provide more depth cue. Furthermore, we developed an interactive glyph visualization system to explore different glyph-based visualization applications. In the system, we provide a few lens utilities that allows users to pick a glyph or a feature and look at it from different view directions.

Our method uses the identification of photon traces invariant to changes of visual parameters such as the transfer function (TF), or data changes between time-steps in a 4D volume. This lets us operate on a variant subset of the entire photon distribution. The amount of computation required in the two stages of the photon mapping process, namely tracing and gathering, can thus be reduced to the subset that are affected by a data or visual parameter change. We rely on two different types of information from the original data to identify the regions that have changed. A low resolution uniform grid containing the minimum and maximum data values of the original data is derived for each time step. Similarly, for two consecutive time-steps, a low resolution grid containing the difference between the overlapping data is used. We show that this compact metadata can be combined with the transfer function to identify the regions that have changed. Each photon traverses the low-resolution grid to identify if it can be directly transferred to the next photon distribution state or if it needs to be recomputed. An efficient representation of the photon distribution is presented leading to an order of magnitude improved performance of the raycasting step. The utility of the method is demonstrated in several examples that show visual fidelity, as well as performance. The examples show that visual quality can be retained when the fraction of retraced photons is as low as 40%-50%.","article_number":"7534852","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7534852","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7534852/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7534852/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"901","end_page":"910","citing_paper_count":17,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":804,"insert_date":"20160805","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Photonics","Lighting","Visualization","Light sources","Rendering (computer graphics)","Media","Correlation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Volume rendering","photon mapping","global illumination","participating media"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Volumetric Data","Time-varying Data","Photon Mapping","Time Step","Changes In Parameters","Metadata","State Data","Conditions Data","Status Data","Visible Changes","Visual Quality","Uniform Grid","Visual Parameters","Consecutive Time Steps","Photon Distribution","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Light Source","Cell Size","Volume Of Data","Intensity Data","Density Estimation","Graphics Processing Unit","GPUs","Changes In Data","Scalar Value","Mean Absolute Deviation","Average Absolute Difference","Mean Absolute Difference","Average Absolute Deviation","Computational Overhead","Performance Gain","Memory Consumption","Brute-force Method","Interactive Exploration","Important Metrics","Interactive Visualization","Error Metrics"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598825","title":"Physics-Based Visual Characterization of Molecular Interaction Forces","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":77,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"ViRVIG Group, Barcelona Supercomputing Center","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085889295","id":37085889295,"full_name":"Pedro Hermosilla","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["ViRVIG Group, Barcelona Supercomputing Center"]}},{"affiliation":"Barcelona Supercomputing Center","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085892247","id":37085892247,"full_name":"Jorge Estrada","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Barcelona Supercomputing Center"]}},{"affiliation":"Barcelona Supercomputing Center","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085721818","id":37085721818,"full_name":"Victor Guallar","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Barcelona Supercomputing Center"]}},{"affiliation":"Visual Computing Group, Ulm University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295281400","id":37295281400,"full_name":"Timo Ropinski","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Computing Group, Ulm University"]}},{"affiliation":"ViRVIG Group, UPC, Barcelona","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37726992300","id":37726992300,"full_name":"Àlvar Vinacua","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["ViRVIG Group, UPC, Barcelona"]}},{"affiliation":"ViRVIG Group, UPC, Barcelona","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085731781","id":37085731781,"full_name":"Pere-Pau Vázquez","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["ViRVIG Group, UPC, Barcelona"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Molecular simulations are used in many areas of biotechnology, such as drug design and enzyme engineering.

However, these tools, commonly restricted to close interaction between atoms, do not consider whole simulation paths, long-range distances and, importantly, do not provide visual cues for a quick and intuitive comprehension of the energy functions (modeling intermolecular interactions) involved. In this paper, we propose visualizations designed to enable the characterization of interaction forces by taking into account several relevant variables such as molecule-ligand distance and the energy function, which is essential to understand binding affinities. We put emphasis on mapping molecular docking paths obtained from Molecular Dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations, and provide time-dependent visualizations for different energy components and particle resolutions: atoms, groups or residues. The presented visualizations have the potential to support domain experts in a more efficient drug or enzyme design process.","article_number":"7539331","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539331","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539331/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539331/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"731","end_page":"740","citing_paper_count":16,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":681,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Computational modeling","Two dimensional displays","Proteins","Drugs","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Molecular visualization","binding analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Molecular Interactions","Interaction Forces","Molecular Force","Molecular Interaction Forces","Monte Carlo Simulation","Monte Carlo Method","Molecular Dynamics","Design Process","Drug Design","Domain Experts","Engineering Design","Enzyme Engineering","Enzyme Technology","Molecular Interaction Analysis","Simulated Paths","Van Der Waals","Active Group","Van Der Waals Interactions","Calcium Ions","Visual Analysis","Interaction Energy","Binding Mechanism","2D Views","Visualization Techniques","Electrostatic Energy","Coulomb Energy","3D Visualization","2D Visualization","Step In Path","Solvation Energy","Kernel Computation","Kernel Calculation","Interactive Exploration","Aspartic Acid Residues"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598479","title":"A Visual Analytics Approach for Categorical Joint Distribution Reconstruction from Marginal Projections","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":78,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085897527","id":37085897527,"full_name":"Cong Xie","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085894363","id":37085894363,"full_name":"Wen Zhong","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273119700","id":37273119700,"full_name":"Klaus Mueller","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Oftentimes multivariate data are not available as sets of equally multivariate tuples, but only as sets of projections into subspaces spanned by subsets of these attributes. For example, one may find data with five attributes stored in six tables of two attributes each, instead of a single table of five attributes. This prohibits the visualization of these data with standard high-dimensional methods, such as parallel coordinates or MDS, and there is hence the need to reconstruct the full multivariate (joint) distribution from these marginal ones. Most of the existing methods designed for this purpose use an iterative procedure to estimate the joint distribution. With insufficient marginal distributions and domain knowledge, they lead to results whose joint errors can be large. Moreover, enforcing smoothness for regularizations in the joint space is not applicable if the attributes are not numerical but categorical. We propose a visual analytics approach that integrates both anecdotal data and human experts to iteratively narrow down a large set of plausible solutions. The solution space is populated using a Monte Carlo procedure which uniformly samples the solution space. A level-of-detail high dimensional visualization system helps the user understand the patterns and the uncertainties. Constraints that narrow the solution space can then be added by the user interactively during the iterative exploration, and eventually a subset of solutions with narrow uncertainty intervals emerges.","article_number":"7534792","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7534792","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7534792/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7534792/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"51","end_page":"60","citing_paper_count":16,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1083,"insert_date":"20160805","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty","Image reconstruction","Diseases","Visual analytics","Iterative methods","Two dimensional displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Joint Distribution Reconstruction","Solution Space","High-dimensional Data","Multivariate Data","Parallel Coordinates"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Joint Distribution","Visual Analytics Approach","High-dimensional","High-dimensional Space","Cognitive Domains","Domain Knowledge","Solution Space","Marginal Distribution","Set Of Projects","Parallel Coordinates","Boxplots","Margin Of Error","Range Of Characteristics","Range Of Features","High Uncertainty","Joint Probability","Marginal Probability","Purple Line","Departure Time","Line Chart","Polytope","Visual Exploration","Sample S1","Lattice Points","Acceleration Method","Query System","Integer Lattice","Lattice Grid","Integer Points","Preferred Region","Polyline","Two-way Table","Marginal Frequencies","Set Constraints","Iterative Convergence","Upper Bound"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598460","title":"Toward Theoretical Techniques for Measuring the Use of Human Effort in Visual Analytic Systems","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":79,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Smith College","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38229914800","id":38229914800,"full_name":"R.

This approach has enabled some important comparisons between systems, but unfortunately the narrow scope required to facilitate these comparisons has prevented many of these lessons from being generalized to new areas. At the same time, advanced visual analytic systems have made increasing use of human-machine collaboration to solve problems not tractable by machine computation alone. To continue to make progress in modeling user tasks in these hybrid visual analytic systems, we must strive to gain insight into what makes certain tasks more complex than others. This will require the development of mechanisms for describing the balance to be struck between machine and human strengths with respect to analytical tasks and workload. In this paper, we argue for the necessity of theoretical tools for reasoning about such balance in visual analytic systems and demonstrate the utility of the Human Oracle Model for this purpose in the context of sensemaking in visual analytics. Additionally, we make use of the Human Oracle Model to guide the development of a new system through a case study in the domain of cybersecurity.","article_number":"7534744","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7534744","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7534744/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7534744/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"121","end_page":"130","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":945,"insert_date":"20160805","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Genomics","Bioinformatics","Biological cells","Visualization","Animals","Vegetation","Education"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Theoretical models","human oracle","visual analytics","mixed initiative systems","semantic interaction","sensemaking"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual System","Visual Analysis","Human Effort","Visual Analytics System","User Tasks","Patterns In Data","Interactive System","False Alarm","Power Grid","Exhaustive Search","Brute-force Search","Data Streams","False Alarm Rate","Human Experts","Empirical Validation","Human Computer","Optical Character Recognition","Text Recognition","Digit Recognition","Text Detection","Optical Recognition","Human Users","Sense-making Process","Mental Maps","Stream Analysis","Human Analysts","Multitude Of Sources","Financial Fraud","Visual Metaphors","Calculation Process","Computational Process","Utility Grid","Grid Operation","Work In This Area","Theoretical Framework","Theoretical Model","Human Behavior"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598998","title":"Glyphs for General Second-Order 2D and 3D Tensors","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":80,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Visual Computing group at the University of Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085889487","id":37085889487,"full_name":"Tim Gerrits","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Computing group at the University of Magdeburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Visual Computing group at the University of Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266876100","id":37266876100,"full_name":"Christian Rössl","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Computing group at the University of Magdeburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Visual Computing group at the University of Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266875400","id":37266875400,"full_name":"Holger Theisel","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Computing group at the University of Magdeburg, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Glyphs are a powerful tool for visualizing second-order tensors in a variety of scientic data as they allow to encode physical behavior in geometric properties.

In virtual colonoscopy, CT scans are acquired with the patient in two positions, and their registration is desirable so that physicians can corroborate findings between scans. Our algorithm performs this registration efficiently through the use of Fiedler vector representation (the second eigenfunction of the Laplace-Beltrami operator). This representation is employed to first perform global registration of the two colon positions. The registration is then locally refined using the haustral folds, which are automatically segmented using the 3D level sets of the Fiedler vector. The use of Fiedler vectors and the segmented folds presents a precise way of visualizing corresponding regions across datasets and visual modalities. We present multiple methods of visualizing the results, including 2D flattened rendering and the corresponding 3D endoluminal views. The precise fold modeling is used to automatically find a suitable cut for the 2D flattening, which provides a less distorted visualization. Our approach is robust, and we demonstrate its efficiency and efficacy by showing matched views on both the 2D flattened colons and in the 3D endoluminal view. We analytically evaluate the results by measuring the distance between features on the registered colons, and we also assess our fold segmentation against 20 manually labeled datasets. We have compared our results analytically to previous methods, and have found our method to achieve superior results. We also prove the hot spots conjecture for modeling cylindrical topology using Fiedler vector representation, which allows our approach to be used for general cylindrical geometry modeling and feature extraction.","article_number":"7539322","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539322","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539322/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539322/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"751","end_page":"760","citing_paper_count":14,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":448,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Colon","Three-dimensional displays","Computational modeling","Visualization","Level set","Two dimensional displays","Solid modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Medical visualization","colon registration","geometry-based techniques","mathematical foundations for visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Eigenfunctions","Automatic Segmentation","Use Of Representations","Manipulation Of Representations","Local Refinement","Global Registration","Laplace-Beltrami Operator","Eigenvectors","Segmentation Results","Arc Length","Curve Length","Extreme Points","Surface Integrity","Solution Curve","Integral Curves","Computer-aided Diagnosis","Computer-aided Detection","Automatic Diagnosis","Triangular Mesh","Triangle Mesh","Registration Algorithm","Colonization Model","Registration Error","Multiple Orientations","Registration Results","Enrollment Outcomes","Graph Matching","Splenic Flexure","Geodesic Path","Plane Fitting","Polyp Detection","Heat Kernel","Visual Verification","Landmark Detection","Colorectal Cancer","Severe Cases","Eigenvalues"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598898","title":"An Evaluation of Visual Search Support in Maps","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":82,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"VISUS, University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085504694","id":37085504694,"full_name":"Rudolf Netzel","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VISUS, University of Stuttgart"]}},{"affiliation":"VISUS, University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546168600","id":37546168600,"full_name":"Marcel Hlawatsch","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VISUS, University of Stuttgart"]}},{"affiliation":"VISUS, University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586953400","id":37586953400,"full_name":"Michael Burch","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VISUS, University of Stuttgart"]}},{"affiliation":"VISUS, University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085884754","id":37085884754,"full_name":"Sanjeev Balakrishnan","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VISUS, University of Stuttgart"]}},{"affiliation":"VISUS, University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085491052","id":37085491052,"full_name":"Hansjörg Schmauder","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VISUS, University of Stuttgart"]}},{"affiliation":"VISUS, University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268045000","id":37268045000,"full_name":"Daniel Weiskopf","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VISUS, University of Stuttgart"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Visual search can be time-consuming, especially if the scene contains a large number of possibly relevant objects.

In this paper, we present a controlled eye-tracking study (30 participants) to compare four variants of map annotation with labels: within-image annotations, grid reference annotation, directional annotation, and miniature annotation. Within-image annotation places labels directly within the map without any further search support. Grid reference annotation corresponds to the traditional approach known from atlases. Directional annotation utilizes a label in combination with an arrow pointing in the direction of the label within the map. Miniature annotation shows a miniature grid to guide the reader to the area of the map in which the label is located. The study results show that within-image annotation is outperformed by all other annotation approaches. Best task completion times are achieved with miniature annotation. The analysis of eye-movement data reveals that participants applied significantly different visual task solution strategies for the different visual annotations.","article_number":"7539393","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539393","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539393/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539393/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"421","end_page":"430","citing_paper_count":14,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1002,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Search problems","Two dimensional displays","Indexes","Urban areas","Gaze tracking","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual search","laboratory study","eye tracking","map visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Search","Visual Scanning","Visual Support","Visual Reinforcement","Completion Time","Visual Strategies","Elements Of Interest","Eye-tracking Studies","Task Completion Time","Reference Grid","Annotation Approach","Task Performance","Cell Size","Average Change","Grid Cells","Network Services","Search Task","Map Position","Fixation Duration","Eye-tracking Data","Direction Of Arrow","Target Label","Average Fixation Duration","Annotation Methods","Reading Strategies","Label Positions","Hypothesis H5","Traditional Reference","Maps Of Cells","Snellen Chart","Snellen Eye Chart","Snellen Test","Search Area","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598824","title":"Molecular Surface Maps","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":83,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Visualization Research Center (VISUS), University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37885145500","id":37885145500,"full_name":"Michael Krone","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visualization Research Center (VISUS), University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Visualization Research Center (VISUS), University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085901206","id":37085901206,"full_name":"Florian Frieß","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visualization Research Center (VISUS), University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Visualization Research Center (VISUS), University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233051400","id":38233051400,"full_name":"Katrin Scharnowski","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visualization Research Center (VISUS), University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Visualization Research Center (VISUS), University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37287276500","id":37287276500,"full_name":"Guido Reina","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visualization Research Center (VISUS), University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Technical Biochemistry (ITB), University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085903332","id":37085903332,"full_name":"Silvia Fademrecht","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Technical Biochemistry (ITB), University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Technical Biochemistry (ITB), University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085901934","id":37085901934,"full_name":"Tobias Kulschewski","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Technical Biochemistry (ITB), University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Technical Biochemistry (ITB), University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37293894400","id":37293894400,"full_name":"Jürgen Pleiss","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Technical Biochemistry (ITB), University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Visualization Research Center (VISUS), University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268023800","id":37268023800,"full_name":"Thomas Ertl","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visualization Research Center (VISUS), University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present Molecular Surface Maps, a novel, view-independent, and concise representation for molecular surfaces.

If spatial units have the same color and are in the same neighborhood, this region can be visually identified as a spatial cluster. However, the choice of classification method used to create the choropleth map determines the visual output. The critical map elements in the classification scheme are those that lie near the classification boundary as those elements could potentially belong to different classes with a slight adjustment of the classification boundary. Thus, these elements have the most potential to impact the visual features (i.e., spatial clusters) that occur in the choropleth map. We present a methodology to enable analysts and designers to identify spatial regions where the visual appearance may be the result of spurious data artifacts. The proposed methodology automatically detects the critical boundary cases that can impact the overall visual presentation of the choropleth map using a classification metric of cluster stability. The map elements that belong to a critical boundary case are then automatically assessed to quantify the visual impact of classification edge effects. Our results demonstrate the impact of boundary elements on the resulting visualization and suggest that special attention should be given to these elements during map design.","article_number":"7536141","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7536141","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536141/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536141/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"371","end_page":"380","citing_paper_count":13,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1129,"insert_date":"20160808","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Correlation","Measurement","Image color analysis","Data visualization","Data mining","Spatial databases"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Choropleth","Classification","Visualization","Geodemographics","Geovisualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Class Boundaries","Choropleth Maps","Impact Of Boundaries","Classification Methods","Spatial Clustering","Spatial Units","Boundary Element","Visual Output","Map Design","Cartographic Design","Boundary Case","Map Elements","Effects Of Change","Categorical Data","Impact Of Change","Size Of Region","Clustering Results","Spatial Autocorrelation","Change Categories","Identification Of Elements","Changes In Appearance","Clustering Visualization","Spatial Association","Multivariate Classification","Classification Maps","Silhouette Value","Class Intervals","Silhouette Coefficient","Measure Of Spatial Autocorrelation","Set Of Units","Self-organizing Map","Kohonen"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2599040","title":"Direct Multifield Volume Ray Casting of Fiber Surfaces","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":86,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085884422","id":37085884422,"full_name":"Kui Wu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, Argonne National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37692671900","id":37692671900,"full_name":"Aaron Knoll","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SCI Institute, Argonne National Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"ICSE, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085892990","id":37085892990,"full_name":"Benjamin J Isaac","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["ICSE, University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computing, University of Leeds","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282624500","id":37282624500,"full_name":"Hamish Carr","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computing, University of Leeds"]}},{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284312600","id":37284312600,"full_name":"Valerio Pascucci","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SCI Institute, University of Utah"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Multifield data are common in visualization.

Fiber surfaces, an analogy of isosurfaces to bivariate volume data, are a promising new mechanism for understanding multifield volumes. In this work, we explore direct ray casting of fiber surfaces from volume data without any explicit geometry extraction. We sample directly along rays in domain space, and perform geometric tests in range space where fibers are defined, using a signed distance field derived from the control polygons. Our method requires little preprocess, and enables real-time exploration of data, dynamic modification and pixel-exact rendering of fiber surfaces, and support for higher-order interpolation in domain space. We demonstrate this approach on several bivariate datasets, including analysis of multi-field combustion data.","article_number":"7539653","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539653","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539653/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539653/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"941","end_page":"949","citing_paper_count":12,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":660,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Isosurfaces","Rendering (computer graphics)","Casting","Power capacitors","Aerospace electronics","Acceleration","Transfer functions"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Volume Rendering","Isosurface","Multidimensional Data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Fiber Surface","Ray Casting","Ray Shooting","Direct Ray","Volume Ray Casting","Volume Of Data","Intensity Data","Distance Map","Distance Transform","Distance Field","Isosurface","Space Domain","Bivariate Data","Residence Time","Transfer Function","Frame Rate","Regions Of Space","Cosmological","Intersection Point","Line Segment","Different Signs","Segment Size","Uniform Grid","Ray Tracing","2D Histogram","Volume Rendering","Volumetric Rendering","Boolean Variable","Boolean Value","Preprocessing Time","Preimage","Inverse Image","3D Texture","Segment Endpoints","Surface Extraction","Particle Temperature","Interactive"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598591","title":"Optimizing Hierarchical Visualizations with the Minimum Description Length Principle","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":87,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Ontario, Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37893068700","id":37893068700,"full_name":"Rafael Veras","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Ontario, Institute of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Ontario, Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37669874100","id":37669874100,"full_name":"Christopher Collins","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Ontario, Institute of Technology"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this paper we examine how the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle can be used to efficiently select aggregated views of hierarchical datasets that feature a good balance between clutter and information.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to the analysis of the force-induced dynamics of inertial particles. These forces can arise from acceleration fields such as gravitation, but also be dependent on the particle dynamics itself, as in the case of magnetism. Compared to massless particles, the velocity of an inertial particle is not determined solely by its position and time in a vector field. In contrast, its initial velocity can be arbitrary and impacts the dynamics over its entire lifetime. This leads to a four-dimensional problem for 2D setups, and a six-dimensional problem for the 3D case. Our approach avoids this increase in dimensionality and tackles the visualization by an integrated topological analysis approach. We demonstrate the utility of our approach using a synthetic time-dependent acceleration field, a system of magnetic dipoles, and N-body systems both in 2D and 3D.","article_number":"7539608","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539608","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539608/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539608/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"950","end_page":"959","citing_paper_count":11,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":425,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Acceleration","Visualization","Trajectory","Magnetic domains","Two dimensional displays","Dynamics","Magnetic separation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization of inertial dynamics","N-body systems","magnetism","acceleration"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Topological Analysis","Inertial Dynamics","Dynamic Analysis","Kinetic Analysis","Vector Field","3D System","Particle Velocity","Magnetic Dipole","Bending Magnet","Particle Dynamics","Time-dependent Field","Massless Particles","Particle Inertia","Acceleration Field","Degrees Of Freedom","Dimensional Space","Multidimensional Space","Number Of Steps","Point Cloud","Phase Space","Color Map","Transport Time","Grid Resolution","Flow Map","Delaunay Triangulation","Projection Method","Mapping Project","Spatial Projection","Number Of Time Steps","Adaptive Sampling","Test Particle","Gravitational Field","Gravity Field","Visual Space","Spectral Norm"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2599042","title":"Progressive Direct Volume-to-Volume Transformation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":89,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37553894500","id":37553894500,"full_name":"Steffen Frey","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268023800","id":37268023800,"full_name":"Thomas Ertl","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present a novel technique to generate transformations between arbitrary volumes, providing both expressive distances and smooth interpolates.

We therefore propose a progressive refinement approach designed for parallel execution that is able to quickly deliver approximate results that are iteratively improved toward the optimum. On this basis, we further present a new approach for the streaming selection of time steps in temporal data that allows for the reconstruction of the full sequence with a user-specified error bound.

We take a karyogram-based approach to create an interactive synteny visualization, leading to a more appealing and engaging design for undergraduate-level genome evolution education. For validation, we conduct three user studies: two focused studies on color and animation design choices and a larger study that performs overall system usability testing while comparing our karyogram-based designs with two more common genome mapping representations in an educational context. While existing views communicate the same information, study participants found the interactive, karyogram-based views much easier and likable to use. We additionally discuss feedback from biology and genomics faculty, who judge Synteny Explorer's fitness for use in classrooms.","article_number":"7539391","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539391","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539391/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539391/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"711","end_page":"720","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1083,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Genomics","Bioinformatics","Biological cells","Visualization","Animals","Vegetation","Education"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Bioinformatic visualization","education","learning","genome evolution","chromosome","user study"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Genome Evolution","Interactive Visualization","User Study","Extant Species","Genome Mapping","Ancestral Species","Synteny Blocks","Phylogeny","Phylogenetic Tree","Response Time","Karyotype","Genomic Research","Chromosomal Rearrangements","Types Of Questions","Positive Comments","Color Scheme","Negative Comments","Marmoset","Callithrix","Ancestral Reconstruction","Ancestral Range","Introductory Course","Chromosome Evolution","Color Palette","Genome Reconstruction","User Comments","Task Completion Time","Genetic Fragments","Average Completion Time","Chromothripsis","Common Ancestor","Common Ancestry","Shared Ancestry","Specific Chromosome","Chimpanzees","Pan Troglodytes"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598619","title":"Multi-Granular Trend Detection for Time-Series Analysis","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":93,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"TU, Eindhoven","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085900393","id":37085900393,"full_name":"Goethem Arthur Van","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU, Eindhoven"]}},{"affiliation":"MADALGO, Aarhus University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073870800","id":37073870800,"full_name":"Frank Staals","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["MADALGO, Aarhus University"]}},{"affiliation":"Utrecht University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085683218","id":37085683218,"full_name":"Maarten Löffler","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Utrecht University"]}},{"affiliation":"City University, London","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37605079900","id":37605079900,"full_name":"Jason Dykes","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["City University, London"]}},{"affiliation":"TU, Eindhoven","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591266000","id":37591266000,"full_name":"Bettina Speckmann","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU, Eindhoven"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Time series (such as stock prices) and ensembles (such as model runs for weather forecasts) are two important types of one-dimensional time-varying data. Such data is readily available in large quantities but visual analysis of the raw data quickly becomes infeasible, even for moderately sized data sets. Trend detection is an effective way to simplify time-varying data and to summarize salient information for visual display and interactive analysis. We propose a geometric model for trend-detection in one-dimensional time-varying data, inspired by topological grouping structures for moving objects in two- or higher-dimensional space. Our model gives provable guarantees on the trends detected and uses three natural parameters: granularity, support-size, and duration. These parameters can be changed on-demand. Our system also supports a variety of selection brushes and a time-sweep to facilitate refined searches and interactive visualization of (sub-)trends. We explore different visual styles and interactions through which trends, their persistence, and evolution can be explored.","article_number":"7536203","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7536203","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536203/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536203/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"661","end_page":"670","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1302,"insert_date":"20160808","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Market research","Time series analysis","Data visualization","Uncertainty","Visualization","Meteorology","Data models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Interactive Exploration","Trend Detection","Time Series"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Time Series","Trend Detection","Interactive","Visual Analysis","Visual Style","One-dimensional Data","Time Series Data","Probability Density Function","Partial Data","Range Of Groups","Trends Data","Interval Length","Unimodal Distribution","Overview Of Data","Definition Of Groups","Position Time","Main Trends","Core Model","Piecewise Linear Function","Splitting Events","Priority Queue","Visual Encoding","Number Of Time Series","Original Input Data"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2599016","title":"Backward Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponents in Inertial Flows","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":94,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Visual Computing Group, University of Magdeburg","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085416142","id":37085416142,"full_name":"Tobias Günther","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Computing Group, University of Magdeburg"]}},{"affiliation":"Visual Computing Group, University of Magdeburg","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266875400","id":37266875400,"full_name":"Holger Theisel","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Computing Group, University of Magdeburg"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Inertial particles are finite-sized objects that are carried by fluid flows and in contrast to massless tracer particles they are subject to inertia effects. In unsteady flows, the dynamics of tracer particles have been extensively studied by the extraction of Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS), such as hyperbolic LCS as ridges of the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE). The extension of the rich LCS framework to inertial particles is currently a hot topic in the CFD literature and is actively under research. Recently, backward FTLE on tracer particles has been shown to correlate with the preferential particle settling of small inertial particles. For larger particles, inertial trajectories may deviate strongly from (massless) tracer trajectories, and thus for a better agreement, backward FTLE should be computed on inertial trajectories directly. Inertial backward integration, however, has not been possible until the recent introduction of the influence curve concept, which - given an observation and an initial velocity - allows to recover all sources of inertial particles as tangent curves of a derived vector field. In this paper, we show that FTLE on the influence curve vector field is in agreement with preferential particle settling and more importantly it is not only valid for small (near-tracer) particles. We further generalize the influence curve concept to general equations of motion in unsteady spatio-velocity phase spaces, which enables backward integration with more general equations of motion. Applying the influence curve concept to tracer particles in the spatio-velocity domain emits streaklines in massless flows as tangent curves of the influence curve vector field. We demonstrate the correlation between inertial backward FTLE and the preferential particle settling in a number of unsteady vector fields","article_number":"7539598","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539598","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539598/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539598/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"970","end_page":"979","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":678,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Mathematical model","Trajectory","Atmospheric modeling","Gravity","Automobiles","Three-dimensional displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Inertial particles","finite-time Lyapunov exponents","backward integration","preferential particle settling"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Inertial Flow","Fluid Flow","Liquid Flow","Fluid Velocity","Equations Of Motion","Phase Space","Vector Field","Steady Flow","Unsteady Flow","Tracer Particles","Particle Settling","Massless Particles","Particle Inertia","Computation Time","Calculation Time","Residual Error","Newton Method","Newton Iteration","Newton Raphson","Raphson Method","Density Ratio","Particle Velocity","Surrounding Medium","Error Tolerance","Particle Trajectories","Behavior Of Particles","Flow Map","Cauchy-Green Tensor","Stokes Number","Field Eq","Forward Integration","Pathlines","Examples In This Paper","Sand Particles","Sediment Bed","Flow Visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2599043","title":"A Versatile and Efficient GPU Data Structure for Spatial Indexing","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":95,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Visual Computing Center(VCC), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37560044500","id":37560044500,"full_name":"Jens Schneider","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Computing Center(VCC), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)"]}},{"affiliation":"Visual Computing Center(VCC), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37828701300","id":37828701300,"full_name":"Peter Rautek","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Computing Center(VCC), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this paper we present a novel GPU-based data structure for spatial indexing.

Furthermore, the existing matching visualization techniques (i.e. bipartite graph and adjacency matrix) fail in helping the central planner understand the differences between matchings. In this paper, we present VisMatchmaker, a visualization system which allows the central planner to explore alternatives to an algorithm-generated matching. We identified three common tasks in the process of matching adjustment: problem detection, matching recommendation and matching evaluation. We classified matching comparison into three levels and designed visualization techniques for them, including the number line view and the stacked graph view. Two types of algorithmic support, namely direct assignment and range search, and their interactive operations are also provided to enable the user to apply his domain knowledge in matching adjustment.","article_number":"7539560","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539560","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539560/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539560/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"231","end_page":"240","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":518,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Measurement","Processor scheduling","Computers","Resource management","Bipartite graph","Encoding"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Centralized matching","matching visualization","interaction techniques","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Cognitive Domains","Domain Knowledge","Performance Metrics","Visual System","Visualization Techniques","Common Tasks","Matching Problem","Central Planning","User Tasks","Matched Comparison","Graduate Students","Intermediate Results","Intermediate Outcomes","Number Of Agents","Gray Background","Group Of Agents","Teaching Assistants","Education Assistance","Common Metrics","Well-being Scores","Welfare Scores","Popular Agent","List Of Agents","Preferences Of Agents","Multiple Matches","Higher Welfare","Small Bars","Top Choice","Maximum Matching","Advanced Courses","University Department"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598790","title":"Visualizing Shape Deformations with Variation of Geometric Spectrum","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":97,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Wayne State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38006143400","id":38006143400,"full_name":"Jiaxi Hu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Wayne State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Wayne State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38275756000","id":38275756000,"full_name":"Hajar Hamidian","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Wayne State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Wayne State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085891560","id":37085891560,"full_name":"Zichun Zhong","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Wayne State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Wayne State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37285799200","id":37285799200,"full_name":"Jing Hua","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Wayne State University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"This paper presents a novel approach based on spectral geometry to quantify and visualize non-isometric deformations of 3D surfaces by mapping two manifolds. The proposed method can determine multi-scale, non-isometric deformations through the variation of Laplace-Beltrami spectrum of two shapes. Given two triangle meshes, the spectra can be varied from one to another with a scale function defined on each vertex. The variation is expressed as a linear interpolation of eigenvalues of the two shapes. In each iteration step, a quadratic programming problem is constructed, based on our derived spectrum variation theorem and smoothness energy constraint, to compute the spectrum variation. The derivation of the scale function is the solution of such a problem. Therefore, the final scale function can be solved by integral of the derivation from each step, which, in turn, quantitatively describes non-isometric deformations between two shapes. To evaluate the method, we conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real data. We employ real epilepsy patient imaging data to quantify the shape variation between the left and right hippocampi in epileptic brains. In addition, we use longitudinal Alzheimer data to compare the shape deformation of diseased and healthy hippocampus. In order to show the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method, we also compare it with spatial registration-based methods, e.g., non-rigid Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and voxel-based method.

Cutting planes are often used to overcome these issues by presenting more manageable slices of data. The existing literature provides many techniques for visualizing the flow through these cutting planes; however, there is a lack of empirical studies focused on the underlying perceptual cues that make popular techniques successful. This paper presents a quantitative human factors study that evaluates static monoscopic depth and orientation cues in the context of cutting plane glyph designs for exploring and analyzing 3D flow fields. The goal of the study was to ascertain the relative effectiveness of various techniques for portraying the direction of flow through a cutting plane at a given point, and to identify the visual cues and combinations of cues involved, and how they contribute to accurate performance. It was found that increasing the dimensionality of line-based glyphs into tubular structures enhances their ability to convey orientation through shading, and that increasing their diameter intensifies this effect. These tube-based glyphs were also less sensitive to visual clutter issues at higher densities. Adding shadows to lines was also found to increase perception of flow direction. Implications of the experimental results are discussed and extrapolated into a number of guidelines for designing more perceptually effective glyphs for 3D vector field visualizations.","article_number":"7536103","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7536103","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536103/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536103/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"990","end_page":"999","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":711,"insert_date":"20160808","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three-dimensional displays","Visualization","Data visualization","Two dimensional displays","Feature extraction","Clutter","Guidelines"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Flow visualization","3D vector fields","Cutting planes","Glyphs","Perception","Evaluation","Human factors"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Perceptual Effects","Vector Field","3D Vector Field","Quantitative Data","Quantitative Method","Quantitative Assessment","Quantitative Research","Quantitative Studies","Quantitative Approach","Flow Direction","Visual Cues","Flow Field","Depth Perception","Depth Cues","Perceptual Cues","3D Flow","Lack Of Empirical Studies","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Orientation Cues","Confidence Level","Confidence Limits","Tukey HSD","Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference","Line-of-sight","Direct Visualization","Total Error","Targeting Vector","Tube Diameter","Plain Tubes","Spherical Head","Flow Visualization","Projection Error","Depth Error","3D Visualization","Angular Error","Cast Shadows","Visual Noise","Decision Time"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598602","title":"Comparing Cross-Sections and 3D Renderings for Surface Matching Tasks Using Physical Ground Truths","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":100,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Bergen, Norway","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085892591","id":37085892591,"full_name":"Andreas J.

However, there is a lack of empirical research backing up the possible performance differences among the basic techniques for general tasks. One such assumption is that 3D renderings are better for obtaining an overview, whereas cross sectional visualizations such as the commonly used Multi-Planar Reformation (MPR) are better for supporting detailed analysis tasks. In the present study we investigated this common assumption by examining the difference in performance between MPR and 3D rendering for correctly identifying a known surface. We also examined whether prior experience working with image data affects the participant's performance, and whether there was any difference between interactive or static versions of the visualizations. Answering this question is important because it can be used as part of a scientific and empirical basis for determining when to use which of the two techniques. An advantage of the present study compared to other studies is that several factors were taken into account to compare the two techniques. The problem was examined through an experiment with 45 participants, where physical objects were used as the known surface (ground truth). Our findings showed that: 1. The 3D renderings largely outperformed the cross sections; 2. Interactive visualizations were partially more effective than static visualizations; and 3. The high experience group did not generally outperform the low experience group.","article_number":"7539353","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7539353","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539353/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539353/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7747554,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"Jan. 2017","start_page":"781","end_page":"790","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":456,"insert_date":"20160810","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three-dimensional displays","Rendering (computer graphics)","Data visualization","Computed tomography","Two dimensional displays","Spatial databases","Atmospheric measurements"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Human-Computer Interaction","Quantitative Evaluation and Volume Visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Image Synthesis","Rendering Engine","3D Renderings","Physical Truths","Cross-sectional","Imaging Data","Differences In Performance","Physical Body","Physical Objects","Physical Form","Physical Entities","3D Data","Technical Performance","Interactive Visualization","Static Version","Multiplanar Reformation","Multiplanar Reformatting","Interaction Effect","Reaction Time","Correct Responses","Effective Technique","Number Of Responses","Object Recognition","Face Recognition","Axial Slices","Degree Of Interaction","3D Visualization","Visualization Techniques","Number Of Correct Responses","3D Interactions","Reaction Time Data","Confidence Data","Cross-sectional View","Participant Satisfaction","Cardinal Directions","Compass Direction","Cardinal Points","Visual Approach"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2599300","title":"Preface","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":101,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"VAST, City University, London","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047100","id":37283047100,"full_name":"Gennady Andrienko","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VAST, City University, London"]}},{"affiliation":"VAST, Tsinghua University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406039100","id":37406039100,"full_name":"Shixia Liu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VAST, Tsinghua University"]}},{"affiliation":"VAST, Georgia Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267736900","id":37267736900,"full_name":"John Stasko","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VAST, Georgia Institute of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"InfoVis, University of Maryland, College Park","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295438200","id":37295438200,"full_name":"Niklas Elmqvist","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["InfoVis, University of Maryland, College Park"]}},{"affiliation":"InfoVis, Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37293389400","id":37293389400,"full_name":"Bongshin Lee","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["InfoVis, Microsoft Research"]}},{"affiliation":"InfoVis, University of California, Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275869400","id":37275869400,"full_name":"Kwan-Liu Ma","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["InfoVis, University of California, Davis"]}},{"affiliation":"SciVis, Los Alamos National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282713700","id":37282713700,"full_name":"James Ahrens","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SciVis, Los Alamos National Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"SciVis, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275716100","id":37275716100,"full_name":"Robert M.
