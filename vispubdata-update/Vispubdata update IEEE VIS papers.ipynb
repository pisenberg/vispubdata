    "### 1) Finding the issue number\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the issue number for the latest TVCG issue that holds the new VIS papers you would like to add. To do so, do the following: \n",
    "    - Go to the TVCG IEEEXplore entry: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/mostRecentIssue.jsp?punumber=2945. Find the issue that holds the IEEE VIS papers of the year. At the time of writing, this was typicaly issue 1 of each year. Open any paper of this issue. Then check the source of the html page for this paper and search in the source file for \"isnumber\".\n",
    "    - Open the file \"xplore-isnumbers.csv\". Add a new line at the bottom with the year, [YOUR ISNUMBER] ,TVCGSI,articles-SI. TVCGSI stands for \"special issue of TVCG\" and \"articles-SI\" stands for \"article in the special issue\". In the earlier years you can find slightly different codes but those don't have to concern you if you are updating more recent articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: \n",
    "\n",
    "The IEEE VIS 2023 papers can be found here in the digital library: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10373160&punumber=2945. Open a random paper from the issue. For example this one: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10301796. Check the source. In the document metadata you will find the isnumber: isnumber=10373160. Add the following line to xplore-isnumbers.csv: **2023,10373160,TVCGSI,\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Documentation for xplore-isnumbers.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns of this file are:\n",
    "1. year: the year of the conference. E.g.1990 for Vis 1990\n",
    "2. isnumber: the issue number as given by IEEEXplore. See above\n",
    "3. conference: the conference that belongs to the issue number. Vis-conf = the IEEE Visualization conference when papers were still published as conference papers, InfoVis-conf = the IEEE Information Visualization conference when papers were still published as conference papers\n",
    "4. jason_filename = the name of the file that will hold the paper info once downloaded. You don't have to write anything here. This will be automatically set below\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Get the IEEE VIS full paper titles from the IEEE VIS program chairs\n",
    "Every year there are a few errors on the IEEE digital library. In addition, the special issue of TVCG that includes the IEEE VIS full papers (usually the first issue of the year) sometimes contains additional papers such as best papers from associated events such as LDAV. \n",
    "To chatch errors and exclude papers that do not belong on vispubdata, I have data files with the correct titles of each IEEE VIS full paper. These are the titles listed on vispubdata. To get the correct titles email (mailto:program@ieeevis.org)[program@ieeevis.org] to ask for the file. Then go to the folder for the year that you are updating. For example, to add paper titles for VIS 2023, **create a folder** called 2023 and in it a file called **VisTitles.txt**. Copy the titles in there, one title per line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Get the awarded papers\n",
    "Open the file **awardedPapers.csv** and add the information for the paper awards of the conference year you are adding. The paper award types are:\n",
    "- BP = Best paper award\n",
    "- HM = Honorable mention award\n",
    "- TT = Test of Time award\n",
    "- BCS = Best case study award (was given out in the early years, not recently)\n",
    "\n",
    "If a paper received more than one award then separate them by a semicolon. You can do still step after you've done the conversion of IEEEXplore data to vispubdata format. That way you can easily copy the DOIs of the awarded papers from the generated_data file called Vispubdata-Vis.csv if you're adding a new year - if you are adding an older award then search for the DOI on IEEEXplore or vispubdata.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Extract a VIS Authors file from DBLP\n",
    "To do this go to the folder in this repo called \"dblp-data-extraction\" and follow the instructions in the ParseDBLP-VIS-Authors notebook. \n",

    "#### Check for titles that were not found\n",
    "Now we have the data in vispubdata format.  Please read the output above. It's important that each time when you see that a specific title hasn't been found, a reason has been recorded. If a reason has not been recorded then there is either an error in the IEEEXplore DL or in our list of titles. You need to check where the paper is manually. The main reference should be the paper itself. Try to find it on the DL and open the pdf. You can find the title from our list that hasn't been found by going to the year's generated_data folder and opening the respective **TitlesNotFound.txt** file. If you found out where the problem is create a file called **missingTitles-reason.txt**. The header is \"Title\" \"DOI\"  \"Reason\" -> all tab separated. On line 2 copy the title from our titles list (which has to be the correct one), the DOI of the paper, and explain why it's different from the one in the IEEE DL. You can follow the example in the 2018 folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Check if we missed any titles in our list\n",
    "Go to the generated_data folder of the year that you are trying to add. Open it. Check all the papers that have a **conference_external** label in the first column. If you suspect that they might be actual IEEE VIS papers, then investigate why their title is not in your list. Reasons can be:\n",
    "- Many of the entries labeled as conference_external will be editorials, the list of PC members, the OC, etc. You can ignore them\n",
    "- Every once in a while there is something that looks like an actual paper. Don't assume immediately that you missed the paper. Check the program of ieeevis.org of the year you are adding. In the last couple of years, there has been the occasional best paper from an associated event such as LDAV or VDS included in the special issue of TVCG that also includes all VIS papers. We don't want these papers in vispubdata, so ignore them. If you find one of these, create a file called \"non-vis titles in SI.txt\" to the main folder of the year you are adding. Add the paper title. This helps other people to avoid looking for this paper again.\n",
    "- If, however, you find an actual Vis paper with the conference_external label, it means that you didn't have its title in the \"VisTitles.txt\" file. Add it and rerun the code above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, if you are re-checking older years, there is a peculiarity: The special issue contained papers from all 3 conferences (InfoVis, SciVis, and VAST) - so you will see a lot of conference_external labels in the respective files. So you'll have to do a merge of the three vispubdata files and find out what is consistently labeled as conference_external. I haven't written code for that yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fixing the publication year\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are adding a new special issue published after 2015 you have to manually fix the date. Since 2015 VIS papers are published in the first issue of the next calendar year of IEEE TVCG but in vispubdata we record the papers by when they were presented at the conference and not by when they appeared in TVCG.  For simplicity we'll just fix the code of every year to be the year of the folder the data is in\n",
