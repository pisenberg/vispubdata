However, it is often challenging for beginners to take their first step due to the complexity of understanding and applying deep learning. We present CNN Explainer, an interactive visualization tool designed for non-experts to learn and examine convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a foundational deep learning model architecture. Our tool addresses key challenges that novices face while learning about CNNs, which we identify from interviews with instructors and a survey with past students. CNN Explainer tightly integrates a model overview that summarizes a CNN's structure, and on-demand, dynamic visual explanation views that help users understand the underlying components of CNNs. Through smooth transitions across levels of abstraction, our tool enables users to inspect the interplay between low-level mathematical operations and high-level model structures. A qualitative user study shows that CNN Explainer helps users more easily understand the inner workings of CNNs, and is engaging and enjoyable to use. We also derive design lessons from our study. Developed using modern web technologies, CNN Explainer runs locally in users' web browsers without the need for installation or specialized hardware, broadening the public's education access to modern deep learning techniques.","article_number":"9222325","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222325","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222325/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222325/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1396","end_page":"1406","citing_paper_count":110,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":5295,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Deep learning","Tools","Visualization","Mathematical model","Neurons","Convolutional neural networks"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Deep learning","machine learning","convolutional neural networks","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Neural Network","Convolutional Neural Network","Interactive Visualization","Learning Convolutional Neural Network","Deep Learning","Deep Learning Models","User Study","Visualization Tool","Level Of Abstraction","Web Browser","Mathematical Operations","Math Operations","Lesson Design","Interactive Visualization Tool","Observational Studies","Population-based Study","Machine Learning","Machine-learning","Hyperparameters","Convolutional Layers","Output Layer","Input Image","Image Classification","Neurons In Layer","Generative Adversarial Networks","Adversarial Learning","Visual Analytics Tool","Activation Maps","Text Annotation","Long Short-term Memory","Long Short Term Memory","LSTM","Kernel Weight","Flat Layer","Convolution Operation","Types Of Layers"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030460","title":"Personal Augmented Reality for Information Visualization on Large Interactive Displays","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":2,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Interactive Media Lab, Technische Universitat Dresden, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656898","id":37088656898,"full_name":"Patrick Reipschlager","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Interactive Media Lab, Technische Universitat Dresden, Germany","Centre for Tactile Internet (CeTi), Cluster of Excellence Physics of Life, Dresden, TU Dresden"]}},{"affiliation":"Interactive Media Lab, Technische Universitat Dresden, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086521875","id":37086521875,"full_name":"Tamara Flemisch","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Interactive Media Lab, Technische Universitat Dresden, Germany","Centre for Tactile Internet (CeTi), Cluster of Excellence Physics of Life, Dresden, TU Dresden"]}},{"affiliation":"Interactive Media Lab, Technische Universitat Dresden, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37313321900","id":37313321900,"full_name":"Raimund Dachselt","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Interactive Media Lab, Technische Universitat Dresden, Germany","Centre for Tactile Internet (CeTi), Cluster of Excellence Physics of Life, Dresden, TU Dresden"]}}]},"access_type":"CCBY - IEEE is not the copyright holder of this material.

Even though large displays provide more display space, they are challenging with regard to perception, effective multi-user support, and managing data density and complexity. To address these issues and illustrate our proposed setup, we contribute an extensive design space comprising first, the spatial alignment of display, visualizations, and objects in AR space. Next, we discuss which parts of a visualization can be augmented. Finally, we analyze how AR can be used to display personal views in order to show additional information and to minimize the mutual disturbance of data analysts. Based on this conceptual foundation, we present a number of exemplary techniques for extending visualizations with AR and discuss their relation to our design space. We further describe how these techniques address typical visualization problems that we have identified during our literature research. To examine our concepts, we introduce a generic AR visualization framework as well as a prototype implementing several example techniques. In order to demonstrate their potential, we further present a use case walkthrough in which we analyze a movie data set. From these experiences, we conclude that the contributed techniques can be useful in exploring and understanding multivariate data. We are convinced that the extension of large displays with AR for information visualization has a great potential for data analysis and sense-making.","article_number":"9223669","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9223669","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9223669/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9223669/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1182","end_page":"1192","citing_paper_count":66,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":5904,"insert_date":"20201014","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Data analysis","Augmented reality","Three-dimensional displays","Navigation","Visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Augmented Reality","Information Visualization","InfoVis","Large Displays","Immersive Analytics","Physical Navigation","Multiple Coordinated Views"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Information","Multivariate Data","Multivariate Statistics","Design Space","Personal Views","Spatial Alignment","Scatter Plot","Strong Connection","Central Zone","Analysis Tasks","Third Dimension","Visualization Techniques","Interactive Visualization","Peripheral Vision","Visible Part","Part Of Screening","Immersive Environment","Additional Devices","Perceptions Of Issues","Mixed Reality","Use Case Scenarios","Spatial Zones","Display Area","Bottom Zone","Multi-user Scenario","Star Wars","Specific Use Case","Multiple Users","Multiple Use","Visual Encoding","Large Amount Of Data","Screen Space"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030450","title":"Shared Surfaces and Spaces: Collaborative Data Visualisation in a Co-located Immersive Environment","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":3,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Monash University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656926","id":37088656926,"full_name":"Benjamin Lee","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655968","id":37088655968,"full_name":"Xiaoyun Hu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085649401","id":37085649401,"full_name":"Maxime Cordeil","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086068796","id":37086068796,"full_name":"Arnaud Prouzeau","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38488917300","id":38488917300,"full_name":"Bernhard Jenny","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37326161000","id":37326161000,"full_name":"Tim Dwyer","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Immersive technologies offer new opportunities to support collaborative visual data analysis by providing each collaborator a personal, high-resolution view of a flexible shared visualisation space through a head mounted display. However, most prior studies of collaborative immersive analytics have focused on how groups interact with surface interfaces such as tabletops and wall displays. This paper reports on a study in which teams of three co-located participants are given flexible visualisation authoring tools to allow a great deal of control in how they structure their shared workspace. They do so using a prototype system we call FIESTA: the Free-roaming Immersive Environment to Support Team-based Analysis. Unlike traditional visualisation tools, FIESTA allows users to freely position authoring interfaces and visualisation artefacts anywhere in the virtual environment, either on virtual surfaces or suspended within the interaction space. Our participants solved visual analytics tasks on a multivariate data set, doing so individually and collaboratively by creating a large number of 2D and 3D visualisations. Their behaviours suggest that the usage of surfaces is coupled with the type of visualisation used, often using walls to organise 2D visualisations, but positioning 3D visualisations in the space around them. Outside of tightly-coupled collaboration, participants followed social protocols and did not interact with visualisations that did not belong to them even if outside of its owner's personal workspace.","article_number":"9222346","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222346","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222346/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222346/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1171","end_page":"1181","citing_paper_count":61,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2379,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Collaboration","Three-dimensional displays","Task analysis","Two dimensional displays","Microsoft Windows","Virtual environments"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Immersive analytics","collaboration","virtual reality","qualitative study","multivariate data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Visualization","Immersive Environment","Collaborative Data","Virtually","Virtual Environment","Virtual Reality","Visual Task","3D Visualization","Interaction Space","Head-mounted Display","Type Of Visualization","Coworking Spaces","Shared Workspace","Interactive","Audience","Metaphor","Gestures","Stage 2","3D Space","3-dimensional Space","Territoriality","Scent Marks","Territorial Behavior","Collaborative Environment","Collaborative System","2D Visualization","Use Of Surfaces","Surface Manipulation","Collaborative Behavior","Collaborative Behaviour","Center Of The Room","Laser Pointer","3D World","Virtual Avatar","Profile Pictures","Collaborative Tasks"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030354","title":"Explainable Matrix - Visualization for Global and Local Interpretability of Random Forest Classification Ensembles","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":4,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Federal Institute of São Paulo (IFSP) and University of São Paulo (USP), Brzil","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38255637000","id":38255637000,"full_name":"Mário Popolin Neto","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Federal Institute of São Paulo (IFSP) and University of São Paulo (USP), Brzil"]}},{"affiliation":"Dalhousie University, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590969400","id":37590969400,"full_name":"Fernando V.

In these years, the north of the majority of the researchers had been to improve quantitative metrics, notwithstanding the lack of information about models' decisions such metrics convey. This paradigm has recently shifted, and strategies beyond tables and numbers to assist in interpreting models' decisions are increasing in importance. Part of this trend, visualization techniques have been extensively used to support classification models' interpretability, with a significant focus on rule-based models. Despite the advances, the existing approaches present limitations in terms of visual scalability, and the visualization of large and complex models, such as the ones produced by the Random Forest (RF) technique, remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose Explainable Matrix (ExMatrix), a novel visualization method for RF interpretability that can handle models with massive quantities of rules. It employs a simple yet powerful matrix-like visual metaphor, where rows are rules, columns are features, and cells are rules predicates, enabling the analysis of entire models and auditing classification results. ExMatrix applicability is confirmed via different examples, showing how it can be used in practice to promote RF models interpretability.","article_number":"9222255","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222255","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222255/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222255/","publication_title":"IEEE

computations and simplify graph visualizations. By comprehensively analyzing the literature on graph sampling, we assume that existing algorithms cannot effectively preserve minority structures that are rare and small in a graph but are very important in graph analysis. In this work, we initially conduct a pilot user study to investigate representative minority structures that are most appealing to human viewers. We then perform an experimental study to evaluate the performance of existing graph sampling algorithms regarding minority structure preservation. Results confirm our assumption and suggest key points for designing a new graph sampling approach named mino-centric graph sampling (MCGS). In this approach, a triangle-based algorithm and a cut-point-based algorithm are proposed to efficiently identify minority structures. A set of importance assessment criteria are designed to guide the preservation of important minority structures. Three optimization objectives are introduced into a greedy strategy to balance the preservation between minority and majority structures and suppress the generation of new minority structures. A series of experiments and case studies are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed MCGS.","article_number":"9222065","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222065","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222065/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222065/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1698","end_page":"1708","citing_paper_count":56,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1182,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Measurement","Image edge detection","Acceleration","Visualization","Bridges","Visual perception","Optimization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Graph sampling","graph visualization","node-link diagram"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Experimental Studies","Series Of Experiments","User Study","General Structure","Graphical Analysis","Graphon","Structural Conservation","Preservation Of Structure","Visibility Graph","Greedy Strategy","Sampling Rate","Random Sampling","Typical Structure","Cut-points","Random Walk","Intersection Over Union","Jaccard Similarity","Jaccard Distance","Intersection-over-union","Jaccard Index","Experimental Basis","Small Communities","Graph Structure","Graph Partitioning","Multilevel Techniques","Depth-first","Depth First Search","Depth-first Search","High-degree Nodes","Random Node","Graph Datasets","Graph Data Sets","Graph Of Order","Original Graph","Random Edge","Reference Algorithm","Visual Shape","Community Detection","Popular Metrics"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030378","title":"NL4DV: A Toolkit for Generating Analytic Specifications for Data Visualization from Natural Language Queries","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":6,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087083944","id":37087083944,"full_name":"Arpit Narechania","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086239144","id":37086239144,"full_name":"Arjun Srinivasan","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267736900","id":37267736900,"full_name":"John Stasko","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Natural language interfaces (NLls) have shown great promise for visual data analysis, allowing people to flexibly specify and interact with visualizations.

We present NL4DV, a toolkit for natural language-driven data visualization. NL4DV is a Python package that takes as input a tabular dataset and a natural language query about that dataset. In response, the toolkit returns an analytic specification modeled as a JSON object containing data attributes, analytic tasks, and a list of Vega-Lite specifications relevant to the input query. In doing so, NL4DV aids visualization developers who may not have a background in NLP, enabling them to create new visualization NLIs or incorporate natural language input within their existing systems. We demonstrate NL4DV's usage and capabilities through four examples: 1) rendering visualizations using natural language in a Jupyter notebook, 2) developing a NLI to specify and edit Vega-Lite charts, 3) recreating data ambiguity widgets from the DataTone system, and 4) incorporating speech input to create a multimodal visualization system.","article_number":"9222342","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222342","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222342/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222342/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"369","end_page":"379","citing_paper_count":53,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1823,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Task analysis","Natural language processing","Grammar","Motion pictures"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Natural Language Interfaces","Visualization Toolkits"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Visualization","Natural Language","Natural Language Query","Ambiguity","Visual System","Visual Analysis","Analysis Tasks","Jupyter Notebook","Visual Design","Natural Language Processing Techniques","Speech Input","Histogram","Areas For Improvement","Graphical User Interface","Graphical Interface","Semantic Similarity","Semantic Relatedness","Question Answering","Question-answering","Bar Charts","Postage","Part-of-speech Tagging","Postal Mail","Part Of Speech Tagging","Design Goals","Inference Task","Line Chart","Dependency Parsing","Quantitative Properties","Quantitative Dimensions","Quantitative Attributes","Drop-down Menu","Text Similarity","String Distance","String Similarity","Science Fiction","JavaScript","Tokenized","Web-based Visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030352","title":"StackGenVis: Alignment of Data, Algorithms, and Models for Stacking Ensemble Learning Using Performance Metrics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":7,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Linnaeus University, Växjö, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086529537","id":37086529537,"full_name":"Angelos Chatzimparmpas","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Linnaeus University, Växjö, Sweden"]}},{"affiliation":"Linnaeus University, Växjö, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086180105","id":37086180105,"full_name":"Rafael M.

Stacking (also called “stacked generalization”) is an ensemble method that combines heterogeneous base models, arranged in at least one layer, and then employs another metamodel to summarize the predictions of those models. Although it may be a highly-effective approach for increasing the predictive performance of ML, generating a stack of models from scratch can be a cumbersome trial-and-error process. This challenge stems from the enormous space of available solutions, with different sets of data instances and features that could be used for training, several algorithms to choose from, and instantiations of these algorithms using diverse parameters (i.e., models) that perform differently according to various metrics. In this work, we present a knowledge generation model, which supports ensemble learning with the use of visualization, and a visual analytics system for stacked generalization. Our system, StackGenVis, assists users in dynamically adapting performance metrics, managing data instances, selecting the most important features for a given data set, choosing a set of top-performant and diverse algorithms, and measuring the predictive performance. In consequence, our proposed tool helps users to decide between distinct models and to reduce the complexity of the resulting stack by removing overpromising and underperforming models. The applicability and effectiveness of StackGenVis are demonstrated with two use cases: a real-world healthcare data set and a collection of data related to sentiment/stance detection in texts.

Trajectories in sports, such as the movement of players and balls, contain rich information on player behavior and thus have been widely analyzed by coaches and analysts to improve the players' performance. However, existing visual analytics systems often present the trajectories in court diagrams that are abstractions of reality, thereby causing difficulty for the experts to imagine the situation on the court and understand why the player acted in a certain way. With recent developments in immersive technologies, such as virtual reality (VR), experts gradually have the opportunity to see, feel, explore, and understand these 3D trajectories from the player's perspective. Yet, few research has studied how to support immersive analysis of sports data from such a perspective. Specific challenges are rooted in data presentation (e.g., how to seamlessly combine 2D and 3D visualizations) and interaction (e.g., how to naturally interact with data without keyboard and mouse) in VR. To address these challenges, we have worked closely with domain experts who have worked for a top national badminton team to design ShuttleSpace. Our system leverages 1) the peripheral vision to combine the 2D and 3D visualizations and 2) the VR controller to support natural interactions via a stroke metaphor. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ShuttleSpace through three case studies conducted by the experts with useful insights. We further conduct interviews with the experts whose feedback confirms that our first-person immersive analytics system is suitable and useful for analyzing badminton data.","article_number":"9222313","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222313","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222313/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222313/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"860","end_page":"869","citing_paper_count":48,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2111,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Trajectory","Three-dimensional displays","Sports","Data visualization","Two dimensional displays","Visualization","Games"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Movement trajectory","badminton analytics","virtual reality"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Immersive Visualization","Nature Of Interactions","Domain Experts","3D Visualization","National Team","Trajectory Data","Peripheral Vision","Top Team","Immersive Technologies","2D Visualization","Immersive System","Player Movement","Interactive","Trajectory Analysis","3D Data","Real-world Datasets","Design Requirements","Usage Rate","Exploration Process","Workflow Systems","Virtual Reality Headset","Virtual Reality Head-mounted Display","VR Headset","First-person Perspective","Visual Design","Virtual Reality System","Immersive Environment","Design Goals"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030403","title":"Calliope: Automatic Visual Data Story Generation from a Spreadsheet","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":9,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087406084","id":37087406084,"full_name":"Danqing Shi","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University"]}},{"affiliation":"Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087405128","id":37087405128,"full_name":"Xinyue Xu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University"]}},{"affiliation":"Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656468","id":37088656468,"full_name":"Fuling Sun","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University"]}},{"affiliation":"Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086368227","id":37086368227,"full_name":"Yang Shi","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University"]}},{"affiliation":"Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604309600","id":37604309600,"full_name":"Nan Cao","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Visual data stories shown in the form of narrative visualizations such as a poster or a data video, are frequently used in data-oriented storytelling to facilitate the understanding and memorization of the story content.

Particularly, Calliope incorporates a new logic-oriented Monte Carlo tree search algorithm that explores the data space given by the input spreadsheet to progressively generate story pieces (i.e., data facts) and organize them in a logical order. The importance of data facts is measured based on information theory, and each data fact is visualized in a chart and captioned by an automatically generated description. We evaluate the proposed technique through three example stories, two controlled experiments, and a series of interviews with 10 domain experts.

Because of its generalizability, the MV design has been widely adopted by the visualization community to help users examine and interact with large, complex, and high-dimensional data. However, although ubiquitous, there has been little work to categorize and analyze MVs in order to better understand its design space. As a result, there has been little to no guideline in how to use the MV design effectively. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of how MVs are designed in practice. We focus on two fundamental measures of multiple-view patterns: composition, which quantifies what view types and how many are there; and configuration, which characterizes spatial arrangement of view layouts in the display space. We build a new dataset containing 360 images of MVs collected from IEEE VIS, EuroVis, and PacificVis publications 2011 to 2019, and make fine-grained annotations of view types and layouts for these visualization images. From this data we conduct composition and configuration analyses using quantitative metrics of term frequency and layout topology. We identify common practices around MVs, including relationship of view types, popular view layouts, and correlation between view types and layouts. We combine the findings into a MV recommendation system, providing interactive tools to explore the design space, and support example-based design.","article_number":"9222323","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222323","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222323/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222323/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1514","end_page":"1524","citing_paper_count":45,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1367,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Layout","Visualization","Tools","Task analysis","Guidelines"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Multiple views","design pattern","quantitative analysis","example-based design"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Composition Patterns","Complex Data","Design Space","Recommender Systems","Quantitative Metrics","Layout Design","Aspect Ratio","Conditional Probability","Completion Time","Bounding Box","Bar Charts","Infographic","Graphical Display","Center Of Box","Graphic Design","Treemap","Tree Map","Functional Tree","Performance Of Trees","Visual Design","Line Chart","Understanding Of Space","Basic Mode","JPEG Images","JPEG Files","Exploration Mode","Partial Mode","Digital Object Identifier","JSON File","Parallel Coordinates","3D Tensor","Goal Of This Paper","Pie Chart","Intersection Over Union","Jaccard Similarity","Jaccard Distance","Intersection-over-union","Jaccard Index"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030334","title":"Uplift: A Tangible and Immersive Tabletop System for Casual Collaborative Visual Analytics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":11,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Monash University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085527281","id":37085527281,"full_name":"Barrett Ens","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077419200","id":37077419200,"full_name":"Sarah Goodwin","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086068796","id":37086068796,"full_name":"Arnaud Prouzeau","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656841","id":37088656841,"full_name":"Fraser Anderson","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086495752","id":37086495752,"full_name":"Florence Y.

These processes are typically imagined as formalised, extended activities, between groups of dedicated experts, requiring expertise with sophisticated data analysis tools. However, there are many professional domains that benefit from support for short 'bursts' of data exploration between a subset of stakeholders with a diverse breadth of knowledge. Such 'casual collaborative' scenarios will require engaging features to draw users' attention, with intuitive, 'walk-up and use' interfaces. This paper presents Uplift, a novel prototype system to support 'casual collaborative visual analytics' for a campus microgrid, co-designed with local stakeholders. An elicitation workshop with key members of the building management team revealed relevant knowledge is distributed among multiple experts in their team, each using bespoke analysis tools. Uplift combines an engaging 3D model on a central tabletop display with intuitive tangible interaction, as well as augmented-reality, mid-air data visualisation, in order to support casual collaborative visual analytics for this complex domain. Evaluations with expert stakeholders from the building management and energy domains were conducted during and following our prototype development and indicate that Uplift is successful as an engaging backdrop for casual collaboration. Experts see high potential in such a system to bring together diverse knowledge holders and reveal complex interactions between structural, operational, and financial aspects of their domain. Such systems have further potential in other domains that require collaborative discussion or demonstration of models, forecasts, or cost-benefit analyses to high-level stakeholders.","article_number":"9229116","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9229116","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9229116/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9229116/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1193","end_page":"1203","citing_paper_count":45,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1968,"insert_date":"20201019","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Collaboration","Data visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Visual analytics","Stakeholders","Microgrids","Smart grids"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data visualisation","tangible and embedded interaction","augmented reality","immersive analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Visualization","Exploratory Data","Prototype System","Building Energy","Building Management","Interactive","Expert Group","Knowledge Sharing","Knowledge-sharing","Design Criteria","Design Criterion","Domain Experts","Temporal Data","3D Visualization","Workshop Participants","Smart Grid","Collaborative Platform","Groupware","Collaborative Tools","Peak Demand","Off-peak","Virtual Objects","Feedback Sessions","Solar Generation","Co-design Process","Time Granularity","HoloLens","Building Occupants","Residents Of Buildings","Workshop Activities","Diverse Stakeholders","Variety Of Stakeholders","Intuitive Way","Diverse Users","Variety Of Users","Photovoltaic Panels"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030335","title":"Visual Reasoning Strategies for Effect Size Judgments and Decisions","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":12,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Washington","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543362","id":37086543362,"full_name":"Alex Kale","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Washington"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Michigan","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38529287400","id":38529287400,"full_name":"Matthew Kay","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Michigan"]}},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38016234500","id":38016234500,"full_name":"Jessica Hullman","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Uncertainty visualizations often emphasize point estimates to support magnitude estimates or decisions through visual comparison. However, when design choices emphasize means, users may overlook uncertainty information and misinterpret visual distance as a proxy for effect size. We present findings from a mixed design experiment on Mechanical Turk which tests eight uncertainty visualization designs: 95% containment intervals, hypothetical outcome plots, densities, and quantile dotplots, each with and without means added. We find that adding means to uncertainty visualizations has small biasing effects on both magnitude estimation and decision-making, consistent with discounting uncertainty. We also see that visualization designs that support the least biased effect size estimation do not support the best decision-making, suggesting that a chart user's sense of effect size may not necessarily be identical when they use the same information for different tasks. In a qualitative analysis of users' strategy descriptions, we find that many users switch strategies and do not employ an optimal strategy when one exists. Uncertainty visualizations which are optimally designed in theory may not be the most effective in practice because of the ways that users satisfice with heuristics, suggesting opportunities to better understand visualization effectiveness by modeling sets of potential strategies.","article_number":"9222364","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222364","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222364/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222364/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"272","end_page":"282","citing_paper_count":40,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1447,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty","Visualization","Data visualization","Task analysis","Decision making","Estimation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty visualization","graphical perception","data cognition"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Strategies","Visual Reasoning","Qualitative Analysis","Qualitative Data Analysis","Heuristic","Rule Of Thumb","Point Estimates","Visual Effects","Visual Events","Design Choices","Mechanical Turk","Uncertainty Information","Proxy For Size","Visual Design","Satisficing","Visual Distance","High Diversity","High Variation","Variable Levels","Percentage Points","Risk Aversion","Risk Attitudes","Risk Tolerance","Risk-averse","Class Of Problems","Increase In The Probability","Point Of Subjective Equality","Just Noticeable Difference","Just-noticeable-difference","Decision-making Biases","Bias In Decision-making","Scattered Distribution","Spread Of Distribution","Axis Scale","Win Probability","Decision Task","Small Bias","Small Biases","Equal Number Of Trials","Kinds Of Models"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030458","title":"Towards Better Bus Networks: A Visual Analytics Approach","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":13,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China and Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085887051","id":37085887051,"full_name":"Di Weng","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China and Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656513","id":37088656513,"full_name":"Chengbo Zheng","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China and Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547598","id":37086547598,"full_name":"Zikun Deng","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China and Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655638","id":37088655638,"full_name":"Mingze Ma","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"JD Intelligent Cities Research, JD Intelligent Cities Business Unit, JD Digits, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085887993","id":37085887993,"full_name":"Jie Bao","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["JD Intelligent Cities Research, JD Intelligent Cities Business Unit, JD Digits, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"JD Intelligent Cities Research, JD Intelligent Cities Business Unit, JD Digits, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37600606700","id":37600606700,"full_name":"Yu Zheng","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["JD Intelligent Cities Research, JD Intelligent Cities Business Unit, JD Digits, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Information Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Henan Institute of Advanced Technology, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396970400","id":37396970400,"full_name":"Mingliang Xu","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Henan Institute of Advanced Technology, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China and Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","id":37407308300,"full_name":"Yingcai Wu","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China and Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Bus routes are typically updated every 3–5 years to meet constantly changing travel demands. However, identifying deficient bus routes and finding their optimal replacements remain challenging due to the difficulties in analyzing a complex bus network and the large solution space comprising alternative routes. Most of the automated approaches cannot produce satisfactory results in real-world settings without laborious inspection and evaluation of the candidates. The limitations observed in these approaches motivate us to collaborate with domain experts and propose a visual analytics solution for the performance analysis and incremental planning of bus routes based on an existing bus network. Developing such a solution involves three major challenges, namely, a) the in-depth analysis of complex bus route networks, b) the interactive generation of improved route candidates, and c) the effective evaluation of alternative bus routes. For challenge a, we employ an overview-to-detail approach by dividing the analysis of a complex bus network into three levels to facilitate the efficient identification of deficient routes.

These language models are typified by a pre-training process on large unlabeled text corpora and subsequently fine-tuned for specific tasks. Although considerable work has been devoted to understanding the attention mechanisms of pre-trained models, it is less understood how a model's attention mechanisms change when trained for a target NLP task. In this paper, we propose a visual analytics approach to understanding fine-tuning in attention-based language models. Our visualization, Attention Flows, is designed to support users in querying, tracing, and comparing attention within layers, across layers, and amongst attention heads in Transformer-based language models. To help users gain insight on how a classification decision is made, our design is centered on depicting classification-based attention at the deepest layer and how attention from prior layers flows throughout words in the input. Attention Flows supports the analysis of a single model, as well as the visual comparison between pre-trained and fine-tuned models via their similarities and differences. We use Attention Flows to study attention mechanisms in various sentence understanding tasks and highlight how attention evolves to address the nuances of solving these tasks.","article_number":"9224153","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9224153","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9224153/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9224153/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1160","end_page":"1170","citing_paper_count":38,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1430,"insert_date":"20201014","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Task analysis","Analytical models","Bit error rate","Computational modeling","Visual analytics","Natural language processing"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["NLP","Transformer","Visual Analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Attention Mechanism","Multi-head Attention","Language Model","Attention Flow","Natural Language","Visual Analysis","Visual Comparison","Attention Model","Classification Decision","Understanding Tasks","Natural Language Processing Tasks","Fine-tuned Model","Attention Heads","Deepest Layer","Input Word","Pre-training Process","Long Short-term Memory","Long Short Term Memory","LSTM","Multilayer Perceptron","Layer Model","Aspects Of Model","Transformer Model","Token Embedding","Graph Attention","BERT Model","Unsupervised Tasks","Pre-training Tasks","Word Embedding","Word Vectors","Center Of The Earth","Earth’s Inner Core","Earth’s Center","Visual Design","Number Of Heads","Sentence Pairs"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030359","title":"PassVizor: Toward Better Understanding of the Dynamics of Soccer Passes","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":15,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086448603","id":37086448603,"full_name":"Xiao Xie","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086242334","id":37086242334,"full_name":"Jiachen Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086546613","id":37086546613,"full_name":"Hongye Liang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086544875","id":37086544875,"full_name":"Dazhen Deng","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Sport Science, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547287","id":37086547287,"full_name":"Shoubin Cheng","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Sport Science, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Sport Science, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086236404","id":37086236404,"full_name":"Hui Zhang","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Sport Science, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37291847800","id":37291847800,"full_name":"Wei Chen","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","id":37407308300,"full_name":"Yingcai Wu","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In soccer, passing is the most frequent interaction between players and plays a significant role in creating scoring chances. Experts are interested in analyzing players' passing behavior to learn passing tactics, i.e., how players build up an attack with passing. Various approaches have been proposed to facilitate the analysis of passing tactics. However, the dynamic changes of a team's employed tactics over a match have not been comprehensively investigated. To address the problem, we closely collaborate with domain experts and characterize requirements to analyze the dynamic changes of a team's passing tactics. To characterize the passing tactic employed for each attack, we propose a topic-based approach that provides a high-level abstraction of complex passing behaviors. Based on the model, we propose a glyph-based design to reveal the multi-variate information of passing tactics within different phases of attacks, including player identity, spatial context, and formation. We further design and develop PassVizor, a visual analytics system, to support the comprehensive analysis of passing dynamics. With the system, users can detect the changing patterns of passing tactics and examine the detailed passing process for evaluating passing tactics. We invite experts to conduct analysis with PassVizor and demonstrate the usability of the system through an expert interview.","article_number":"9222314","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222314","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222314/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222314/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1322","end_page":"1331","citing_paper_count":33,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1077,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Sports","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Interviews","Pattern matching","Navigation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Soccer Analysis","Passing Analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Domain Experts","Spatial Context","Expert Interviews","Identification Of Players","Contextual Information","Interactive System","Multiple Phases","Generation Phase","Propagation Phase","Number Of Passes","Sequence Patterns","Defense Strategy","Defence Strategy","Defensive Strategies","Topic Modeling","Detection Of Patterns","Set Of Techniques","Non-negative Matrix Factorization","Spatial Regions","Multiple Passages","Expert Commentary","Multiple Matches","Expert Feedback","Raw Video","Player Movement","Parallel Coordinates","Pattern Mining","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Soccer Match"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030342","title":"DECE: Decision Explorer with Counterfactual Explanations for Machine Learning Models","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":16,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100335","id":37087100335,"full_name":"Furui Cheng","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086012043","id":37086012043,"full_name":"Yao Ming","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","Bloomberg L.P."]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"With machine learning models being increasingly applied to various decision-making scenarios, people have spent growing efforts to make machine learning models more transparent and explainable.

Besides, counterfactual explanations can also serve as efficient probes to the models' decisions. In this work, we exploit the potential of counterfactual explanations to understand and explore the behavior of machine learning models. We design DECE, an interactive visualization system that helps understand and explore a model's decisions on individual instances and data subsets, supporting users ranging from decision-subjects to model developers. DECE supports exploratory analysis of model decisions by combining the strengths of counterfactual explanations at instance- and subgroup-levels. We also introduce a set of interactions that enable users to customize the generation of counterfactual explanations to find more actionable ones that can suit their needs. Through three use cases and an expert interview, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DECE in supporting decision exploration tasks and instance explanations.","article_number":"9229232","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9229232","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9229232/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9229232/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1438","end_page":"1447","citing_paper_count":32,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2113,"insert_date":"20201019","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Machine learning","Analytical models","Predictive models","Tools","Computational modeling","Decision making","Data models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Tabular Data","Explainable Machine Learning","Counterfactual Explanation","Decision Making"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Machine Learning","Machine-learning","Machine Learning Models","Counterfactual Explanations","Exploratory Analysis","Exploratory Data Analysis","Developed Model","Behavioral Model","Decision Model","Interactive Visualization","Expert Interviews","Individual Instances","Body Mass Index","Normal Weight","Prediction Model","Neural Network","Deep Neural Network","Feature Values","Characteristic Values","Medical Students","Variety Of Techniques","Recurrent Neural Network","Complex Pathways","Decision Boundary","Usage Scenarios","Credit Risk","Creditworthiness","Default Risk","Exploratory Procedures","Explainable Artificial Intelligence","Explainable AI","Explainable Machine Learning","Table Headings","Profile Information"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3028985","title":"Boba: Authoring and Visualizing Multiverse Analyses","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":17,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Washington","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655677","id":37088655677,"full_name":"Yang Liu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Washington"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543362","id":37086543362,"full_name":"Alex Kale","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Washington"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086331530","id":37086331530,"full_name":"Tim Althoff","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Washington"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550791300","id":37550791300,"full_name":"Jeffrey Heer","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Washington"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Multiverse analysis is an approach to data analysis in which all “reasonable” analytic decisions are evaluated in parallel and interpreted collectively, in order to foster robustness and transparency.

Such techniques are well established in desktop visualization tools. The two most common techniques are zoom+pan and overview+detail. However, how best to enable the analyst to navigate and view abstract data at different levels of scale in immersive environments has not previously been studied. We report the findings of the first systematic study of immersive navigation techniques for 3D scatterplots. We tested four conditions that represent our best attempt to adapt standard 2D navigation techniques to data visualization in an immersive environment while still providing standard immersive navigation techniques through physical movement and teleportation. We compared room-sized visualization versus a zooming interface, each with and without an overview. We find significant differences in participants' response times and accuracy for a number of standard visual analysis tasks. Both zoom and overview provide benefits over standard locomotion support alone (i.e., physical movement and pointer teleportation). However, which variation is superior, depends on the task. We obtain a more nuanced understanding of the results by analyzing them in terms of a time-cost model for the different components of navigation: way-finding, travel, number of travel steps, and context switching.","article_number":"9222098","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222098","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222098/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222098/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1214","end_page":"1224","citing_paper_count":31,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1581,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Navigation","Data visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Legged locomotion","Task analysis","Standards","Two dimensional displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Immersive Analytics","Information Visualization","Virtual Reality","Navigation","Overview+Detail","Zooming","Scatterplot"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Visualization","3D Scatter Plot","3D Scatterplot","Visual Task","Differences In Participants","Scale Level","Physical Movement","Interactive Visualization","Immersive Environment","Teleportation","Significant Differences In Participants","Interactive Data Visualization","Context Switching","Immersion Technique","Virtually","Virtual Environment","Virtual Reality","Metaphor","Gestures","User Study","Point Cloud","Point Clouds","Information In Space","Qualitative Feedback","Counting Task","Cybersickness","Virtual Reality Sickness","Cyber Sickness","Virtual Reality Headset","Virtual Reality Head-mounted Display","VR Headset","Immersive System","Mental Demands","Navigation Task","Motion Sickness","Camera Movement","Touchpoints","Game Experience"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030461","title":"CNNPruner: Pruning Convolutional Neural Networks with Visual Analytics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":19,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Network Information Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088396085","id":37088396085,"full_name":"Guan Li","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Network Information Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences"]}},{"affiliation":"Visa Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085897852","id":37085897852,"full_name":"Junpeng Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visa Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Ohio State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279493500","id":37279493500,"full_name":"Han-Wei Shen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Ohio State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Network Information Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656726","id":37088656726,"full_name":"Kaixin Chen","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Network Information Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Network Information Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37395012300","id":37395012300,"full_name":"Guihua Shan","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Network Information Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Network Information Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37535424600","id":37535424600,"full_name":"Zhonghua Lu","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Network Information Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated extraordinarily good performance in many computer vision tasks. The increasing size of CNN models, however, prevents them from being widely deployed to devices with limited computational resources, e.g., mobile/embedded devices. The emerging topic of model pruning strives to address this problem by removing less important neurons and fine-tuning the pruned networks to minimize the accuracy loss. Nevertheless, existing automated pruning solutions often rely on a numerical threshold of the pruning criteria, lacking the flexibility to optimally balance the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. Moreover, the complicated interplay between the stages of neuron pruning and model fine-tuning makes this process opaque, and therefore becomes difficult to optimize. In this paper, we address these challenges through a visual analytics approach, named CNNPruner. It considers the importance of convolutional filters through both instability and sensitivity, and allows users to interactively create pruning plans according to a desired goal on model size or accuracy. Also, CNNPruner integrates state-of-the-art filter visualization techniques to help users understand the roles that different filters played and refine their pruning plans. Through comprehensive case studies on CNNs with real-world sizes, we validate the effectiveness of CNNPruner.","article_number":"9222510","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222510","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222510/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222510/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1364","end_page":"1373","citing_paper_count":28,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1061,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Computational modeling","Numerical models","Analytical models","Visual analytics","Predictive models","Deep learning"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["visualization","model pruning","convolutional neural network","explainable artificial intelligence"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Neural Network","Convolutional Neural Network","Visual Analysis","Accuracy Of Model","Model Size","Convolutional Neural Network Model","Visualization Techniques","Importance Of Filtering","Complicated Interplay","Prediction Model","Prediction Accuracy","Convolutional Layers","Feature Maps","Generative Adversarial Networks","Adversarial Learning","Taylor Expansion","Taylor Series Expansion","Tree Nodes","Domain Experts","Important Ones","Number Of Filters","Visual Components","Pruning Process","Tree View","Filters In Layer","Filters In Each Layer","Bubble Plots","Different Levels Of Information","Fine-tuning Process","Recovery Capability","Radar Plot","Filter Model","Information Model"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030350","title":"VATLD: A Visual Analytics System to Assess, Understand and Improve Traffic Light Detection","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":20,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37075500200","id":37075500200,"full_name":"Liang Gou","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655716","id":37088655716,"full_name":"Lincan Zou","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088645807","id":37088645807,"full_name":"Nanxiang Li","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Robert Bosch GmbH, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655682","id":37088655682,"full_name":"Michael Hofmann","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Robert Bosch GmbH, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Robert Bosch GmbH, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656316","id":37088656316,"full_name":"Arvind Kumar Shekar","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Robert Bosch GmbH, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Robert Bosch GmbH, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086090854","id":37086090854,"full_name":"Axel Wendt","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Robert Bosch GmbH, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086048784","id":37086048784,"full_name":"Liu Ren","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Traffic light detection is crucial for environment perception and decision-making in autonomous driving.

The disentangled representation learning extracts data semantics to augment human cognition with human-friendly visual summarization, and the semantic adversarial learning efficiently exposes interpretable robustness risks and enables minimal human interaction for actionable insights. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of various performance improvement strategies derived from actionable insights with our visual analytics system, VATLD, and illustrate some practical implications for safety-critical applications in autonomous driving.","article_number":"9233993","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9233993","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9233993/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9233993/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"261","end_page":"271","citing_paper_count":27,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2266,"insert_date":"20201020","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Detectors","Robustness","Semantics","Autonomous vehicles","Visual analytics","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Traffic light detection","representation learning","semantic adversarial learning","model diagnosing","autonomous driving"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Traffic Light","Visual Analytics System","Traffic Light Detection","Neural Network","Convolutional Neural Network","Deep Neural Network","Detection Accuracy","Performance Accuracy","Deep Convolutional Neural Network","Generative Adversarial Networks","Adversarial Learning","Human Cognition","Human Knowledge","Representation Learning","Actual Knowledge","Actionable Insights","Robust Detection","Minimal Interaction","Disentangled Representation","Traffic Detection","Training Data","Test Data","Single Shot Multibox Detector","Single-shot Multibox Detector","Latent Vector","Adversarial Examples","Semantic Representations","Confidence Score","Low Confidence Scores","Adversarial Robustness","Ground Truth Object","Unseen Data","Robust Score"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030387","title":"VizCommender: Computing Text-Based Similarity in Visualization Repositories for Content-Based Recommendations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":21,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Tableau Research and the University of British Columbia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088642005","id":37088642005,"full_name":"Michael Oppermann","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tableau Research and the University of British Columbia"]}},{"affiliation":"Tableau Research (retired)","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37587984100","id":37587984100,"full_name":"Robert Kincaid","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tableau Research (retired)"]}},{"affiliation":"University of British Columbia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349490300","id":37349490300,"full_name":"Tamara Munzner","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of British Columbia"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Cloud-based visualization services have made visual analytics accessible to a much wider audience than ever before. Systems such as Tableau have started to amass increasingly large repositories of analytical knowledge in the form of interactive visualization workbooks. When shared, these collections can form a visual analytic knowledge base. However, as the size of a collection increases, so does the difficulty in finding relevant information. Content-based recommendation (CBR) systems could help analysts in finding and managing workbooks relevant to their interests. Toward this goal, we focus on text-based content that is representative of the subject matter of visualizations rather than the visual encodings and style. We discuss the challenges associated with creating a CBR based on visualization specifications and explore more concretely how to implement the relevance measures required using Tableau workbook specifications as the source of content data. We also demonstrate what information can be extracted from these visualization specifications and how various natural language processing techniques can be used to compute similarity between workbooks as one way to measure relevance. We report on a crowd-sourced user study to determine if our similarity measure mimics human judgement. Finally, we choose latent Dirichl et al.ocation (LDA) as a specific model and instantiate it in a proof-of-concept recommender tool to demonstrate the basic function of our similarity measure.","article_number":"9222280","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222280","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222280/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222280/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"495","end_page":"505","citing_paper_count":27,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1083,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Task analysis","Feature extraction","Encoding","Recommender systems","Natural language processing"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["visualization recommendation","content-based filtering","recommender systems","visualization workbook repositories"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Content-based Recommendation","Text-based Similarity","Data Sources","Similarity Measure","Similarity Metrics","User Study","Crowdsourcing","Recommender Systems","Natural Language Processing Techniques","Visual Style","Visual Encoding","Similar Model","Browsing","Information Seeking","Information-seeking","Information Search","Hybrid System","Semantic Similarity","Semantic Relatedness","Domain Experts","Word Embedding","Word Vectors","Content Features","Content Characteristics","Feature Engineering","Similar Items","Term Frequency-inverse Document Frequency","Inverse Document Frequency","TF-IDF","Natural Language Processing Models","Collaborative Filtering","Jensen-Shannon Divergence","Jensen Shannon Divergence","Bag-of-words","Bag-of-words Model","Bag Of Words","Recommendation Algorithm","Cold Start","Similarity Judgments","Text Extraction","Text Similarity","String Distance","String Similarity"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030435","title":"Data Visceralization: Enabling Deeper Understanding of Data Using Virtual Reality","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":22,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Monash University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656926","id":37088656926,"full_name":"Benjamin Lee","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656165","id":37088656165,"full_name":"Dave Brown","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37293389400","id":37293389400,"full_name":"Bongshin Lee","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research"]}},{"affiliation":"ENAC, French Civil Aviation University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017336200","id":38017336200,"full_name":"Christophe Hurter","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["ENAC, French Civil Aviation University"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37585786500","id":37585786500,"full_name":"Steven Drucker","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37326161000","id":37326161000,"full_name":"Tim Dwyer","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"A fundamental part of data visualization is transforming data to map abstract information onto visual attributes. While this abstraction is a powerful basis for data visualization, the connection between the representation and the original underlying data (i.e., what the quantities and measurements actually correspond with in reality) can be lost. On the other hand, virtual reality (VR) is being increasingly used to represent real and abstract models as natural experiences to users. In this work, we explore the potential of using VR to help restore the basic understanding of units and measures that are often abstracted away in data visualization in an approach we call data visceralization. By building VR prototypes as design probes, we identify key themes and factors for data visceralization. We do this first through a critical reflection by the authors, then by involving external participants. We find that data visceralization is an engaging way of understanding the qualitative aspects of physical measures and their real-life form, which complements analytical and quantitative understanding commonly gained from data visualization. However, data visceralization is most effective when there is a one-to-one mapping between data and representation, with transformations such as scaling affecting this understanding. We conclude with a discussion of future directions for data visceralization.","article_number":"9229242","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9229242","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9229242/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9229242/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1095","end_page":"1105","citing_paper_count":26,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1815,"insert_date":"20201019","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Prototypes","Probes","Virtual reality","Atmospheric measurements","Particle measurements","Videos"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data visceralization","virtual reality","exploratory study"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Virtually","Virtual Environment","Virtual Reality","Critical Thinking","Critical Analysis","Critical Reflection","Critical Appraisal","Data Visualization","Physical Measures","Quantitative Understanding","Understanding Of Measures","Athletes","Virtual World","Virtual Space","Online World","Olympic Games","Olympics","Solar System","Large Objects","Understanding Of The Data","Real Level","Objects In The Scene","Tall Buildings","Skyscrapers","Virtual Objects","Use Of Virtual Reality","Virtual Reality Users","Original Video","Immersive Technologies","Insightful Data","Physicalism","Desktop Version","Visceral Sensations","Use Of Annotations","World Record","Original Piece","External Feedback","Nuanced Insights","Subject Of Interest","Topics Of Interest","Qualitative Understanding"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030374","title":"VC-Net: Deep Volume-Composition Networks for Segmentation and Visualization of Highly Sparse and Noisy Image Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":23,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Radiology, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086358498","id":37086358498,"full_name":"Yifan Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Radiology, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655896","id":37088655896,"full_name":"Guoli Yan","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656650","id":37088656650,"full_name":"Haikuan Zhu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Radiology, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656730","id":37088656730,"full_name":"Sagar Buch","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Radiology, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656799","id":37088656799,"full_name":"Ying Wang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Radiology, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37372968700","id":37372968700,"full_name":"Ewart Mark Haacke","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Radiology, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37285799200","id":37285799200,"full_name":"Jing Hua","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085891560","id":37085891560,"full_name":"Zichun Zhong","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The fundamental motivation of the proposed work is to present a new visualization-guided computing paradigm to combine direct 3D volume processing and volume rendered clues for effective 3D exploration. For example, extracting and visualizing microstructures in-vivo have been a long-standing challenging problem. However, due to the high sparseness and noisiness in cerebrovasculature data as well as highly complex geometry and topology variations of micro vessels, it is still extremely challenging to extract the complete 3D vessel structure and visualize it in 3D with high fidelity. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep learning method, VC-Net, for robust extraction of 3D microvascular structure through embedding the image composition, generated by maximum intensity projection (MIP), into the 3D volumetric image learning process to enhance the overall performance. The core novelty is to automatically leverage the volume visualization technique (e.g., MIP - a volume rendering scheme for 3D volume images) to enhance the 3D data exploration at the deep learning level. The MIP embedding features can enhance the local vessel signal (through canceling out the noise) and adapt to the geometric variability and scalability of vessels, which is of great importance in microvascular tracking. A multi-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) framework is proposed to effectively learn the 3D volume and 2D MIP feature vectors, respectively, and then explore their inter-dependencies in a joint volume-composition embedding space by unprojecting the 2D feature vectors into the 3D volume embedding space. It is noted that the proposed framework can better capture the small/micro vessels and improve the vessel connectivity. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep learning framework is proposed to construct a joint convolutional embedding space, where the computed vessel probabilities from volume rendering based 2D projection and 3D volume can be explored and integrated synergistically. Experimental results are evaluated and compared with the traditional 3D vessel segmentation methods and the state-of-the-art in deep learning, by using extensive public and real patient (micro- )cerebrovascular image datasets. The application of this accurate segmentation and visualization of sparse and complicated 3D microvascular structure facilitated by our method demonstrates the potential in a powerful MR arteriogram and venogram diagnosis of vascular disease.","article_number":"9222053","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222053","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222053/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222053/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1301","end_page":"1311","citing_paper_count":26,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1106,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three-dimensional displays","Image segmentation","Two dimensional displays","Data visualization","Deep learning","Rendering (computer graphics)","Feature extraction"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Deep neural network","3D cerebrovascular segmentation and visualization","maximum intensity projection (MIP)","joint embedding"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Noisy Image Data","Neural Network","Deep Learning","Convolutional Neural Network","Microvascular","Cerebrovascular","Microvasculature","Microvessels","Image Dataset","Latent Space","Embedding Space","3D Data","Maximum Intensity Projection","3D Volume","Real Patients","Vessel Segmentation","Complex Topology","Sparse Structure","Vessel Structure","Geometry And Topology","3D Image Volume","Deep Neural Network","3D Segmentation","Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping","3D U-Net","Susceptibility-weighted Imaging","Susceptibility Weighted Imaging","3D Visualization","Magnetic Resonance Angiography","MR Angiography","Graph Neural Networks","Domain Experts","Hidden Space","Supplementary Video"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030424","title":"QualDash: Adaptable Generation of Visualisation Dashboards for Healthcare Quality Improvement","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":24,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Bradford and the Wolfson Centre for Applied Health Research, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085641969","id":37085641969,"full_name":"Mai Elshehaly","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bradford and the Wolfson Centre for Applied Health Research, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Bradford and the Wolfson Centre for Applied Health Research, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38096424400","id":38096424400,"full_name":"Rebecca Randell","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bradford and the Wolfson Centre for Applied Health Research, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Tableau, Seattle, Washington, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37719161300","id":37719161300,"full_name":"Matthew Brehmer","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tableau, Seattle, Washington, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Bradford and the Wolfson Centre for Applied Health Research, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086616573","id":37086616573,"full_name":"Lynn McVey","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bradford and the Wolfson Centre for Applied Health Research, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Bradford and the Wolfson Centre for Applied Health Research, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086618015","id":37086618015,"full_name":"Natasha Alvarado","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bradford and the Wolfson Centre for Applied Health Research, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Leeds, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655811","id":37088655811,"full_name":"Chris P.

We present a rigorous task analysis based on interviews with healthcare professionals, a co-design workshop and a series of one-on-one meetings with front line analysts. From these activities we define a metric card metaphor as a unit of visual analysis in healthcare QI, using this concept as a building block for generating highly adaptable dashboards, and leading to the design of a Metric Specification Structure (MSS). Each MSS is a JSON structure which enables dashboard authors to concisely configure unit-specific variants of a metric card, while offloading common patterns that are shared across cards to be preset by the engine. We reflect on deploying and iterating the design of OualDash in cardiology wards and pediatric intensive care units of five NHS hospitals.

In this paper, we present MulTiDR, a new DR framework that enables processing of time-dependent multivariate data as a whole to provide a comprehensive overview of the data. With the framework, we employ DR in two steps. When treating the instances, time points, and attributes of the data as a 3D array, the first DR step reduces the three axes of the array to two, and the second DR step visualizes the data in a lower-dimensional space. In addition, by coupling with a contrastive learning method and interactive visualizations, our framework enhances analysts' ability to interpret DR results.

First and foremost, this ability depends on perceptual discriminability; observers must be able to see the difference between different colors for those colors to communicate different meanings. However, the ability to interpret visualizations also depends on semantic discriminability, the degree to which observers can infer a unique mapping between visual features and concepts, based on the visual features and concepts alone (i.e., without help from verbal cues such as legends or labels). Previous evidence suggested that observers were better at interpreting encoding systems that maximized semantic discriminability (maximizing association strength between assigned colors and concepts while minimizing association strength between unassigned colors and concepts), compared to a system that only maximized color-concept association strength. However, increasing semantic discriminability also resulted in increased perceptual distance, so it is unclear which factor was responsible for improved performance. In the present study, we conducted two experiments that tested for independent effects of semantic distance and perceptual distance on semantic discriminability of bar graph data visualizations. Perceptual distance was large enough to ensure colors were more than just noticeably different. We found that increasing semantic distance improved performance, independent of variation in perceptual distance, and when these two factors were uncorrelated, responses were dominated by semantic distance. These results have implications for navigating trade-offs in color palette design optimization for visual communication.","article_number":"9239918","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9239918","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9239918/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9239918/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1022","end_page":"1031","citing_paper_count":25,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":730,"insert_date":"20201026","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Semantics","Color","Visualization","Observers","Image color analysis","Data visualization","Encoding"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual Reasoning","Information Visualization","Visual Communication","Visual Encoding","Color Perception","Color Cognition"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Communication","Semantic Discrimination","Strength Of Association","Visual Information","Visual Features","Visual Characteristics","Bar Graphs","Effect Of Distance","Color Palette","Colour Palette","Distance Perception","Perceptual Discrimination","Visual Concepts","Semantic Distance","Pairing","Strongly Associated","Weak Association","Strawberry","Color Space","Colour Space","Color Components","Local Solution","Difference In Probability","Blueberry","Assignment Problem","Target Color","Target Colour","Color Correction","Correct Colour","Semantic Associations","Experimental Distance","Watermelon","Citrullus Lanatus","Mean Response Time","Choropleth Maps","Target Concept","Normal Color Vision","Normal Colour Vision"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030396","title":"What Makes a Data-GIF Understandable?","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":27,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086245904","id":37086245904,"full_name":"Xinhuan Shu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086808853","id":37086808853,"full_name":"Aoyu Wu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655779","id":37088655779,"full_name":"Junxiu Tang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"Edinburgh University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085687578","id":37085687578,"full_name":"Benjamin Bach","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Edinburgh University"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","id":37407308300,"full_name":"Yingcai Wu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"GIFs are enjoying increasing popularity on social media as a format for data-driven storytelling with visualization; simple visual messages are embedded in short animations that usually last less than 15 seconds and are played in automatic repetition. In this paper, we ask the question, “What makes a data-GIF understandable?” While other storytelling formats such as data videos, infographics, or data comics are relatively well studied, we have little knowledge about the design factors and principles for “data-GIFs”. To close this gap, we provide results from semi-structured interviews and an online study with a total of 118 participants investigating the impact of design decisions on the understandability of data-GIFs. The study and our consequent analysis are informed by a systematic review and structured design space of 108 data-GIFs that we found online. Our results show the impact of design dimensions from our design space such as animation encoding, context preservation, or repetition on viewers understanding of the GIF's core message.

However, the design of storyline visualizations is a difficult task as users need to balance between aesthetic goals and narrative constraints. Despite that the optimization-based methods have been improved significantly in terms of producing aesthetic and legible layouts, the existing (semi-) automatic methods are still limited regarding 1) efficient exploration of the storyline design space and 2) flexible customization of storyline layouts. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning framework to train an AI agent that assists users in exploring the design space efficiently and generating well-optimized storylines. Based on the framework, we introduce PlotThread, an authoring tool that integrates a set of flexible interactions to support easy customization of storyline visualizations. To seamlessly integrate the AI agent into the authoring process, we employ a mixed-initiative approach where both the agent and designers work on the same canvas to boost the collaborative design of storylines. We evaluate the reinforcement learning model through qualitative and quantitative experiments and demonstrate the usage of PlotThread using a collection of use cases.","article_number":"9222335","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222335","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222335/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222335/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"294","end_page":"303","citing_paper_count":25,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1684,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Layout","Visualization","Reinforcement learning","Collaboration","Task analysis","Optimization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Storyline visualization","reinforcement learning","mixed-initiative design"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Difficult Task","Design Space","Set Of Interactions","Visual Design","Collaborative Design","Reinforcement Learning Framework","Design Space Exploration","Neural Network","Deep Learning","Optimal Model","Time Slot","Design Considerations","Intelligence Agencies","Artificial Agents","Transition Function","Aesthetic Quality","Aesthetic Features","Aesthetic Characteristics","Groups Of Lines","Related Entities","Superhero","Narrative Elements","Graph Layout","Graph Drawing","Goal Of The Agent","Goal Of Each Agent","Changes In Model Parameters"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030410","title":"Revisiting the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem in Deep Traffic Prediction with Visual Analytics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":29,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101788","id":37087101788,"full_name":"Wei Zeng","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Xiamen University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655355","id":37088655355,"full_name":"Chengqiao Lin","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Xiamen University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Xiamen University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38468692500","id":38468692500,"full_name":"Juncong Lin","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Xiamen University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088463260","id":37088463260,"full_name":"Jincheng Jiang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Central South University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37531405500","id":37531405500,"full_name":"Jiazhi Xia","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Central South University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Warwick, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37567685600","id":37567685600,"full_name":"Cagatay Turkay","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Warwick, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37291847800","id":37291847800,"full_name":"Wei Chen","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Deep learning methods are being increasingly used for urban traffic prediction where spatiotemporal traffic data is aggregated into sequentially organized matrices that are then fed into convolution-based residual neural networks. However, the widely known modifiable areal unit problem within such aggregation processes can lead to perturbations in the network inputs. This issue can significantly destabilize the feature embeddings and the predictions - rendering deep networks much less useful for the experts. This paper approaches this challenge by leveraging unit visualization techniques that enable the investigation of many-to-many relationships between dynamically varied multi-scalar aggregations of urban traffic data and neural network predictions. Through regular exchanges with a domain expert, we design and develop a visual analytics solution that integrates 1) a Bivariate Map equipped with an advanced bivariate colormap to simultaneously depict input traffic and prediction errors across space, 2) a Moran's I Scatterplot that provides local indicators of spatial association analysis, and 3) a Multi-scale Attribution View that arranges non-linear dot plots in a tree layout to promote model analysis and comparison across scales. We evaluate our approach through a series of case studies involving a real-world dataset of Shenzhen taxi trips, and through interviews with domain experts. We observe that geographical scale variations have important impact on prediction performances, and interactive visual exploration of dynamically varying inputs and outputs benefit experts in the development of deep traffic prediction models.","article_number":"9228894","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9228894","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9228894/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9228894/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"839","end_page":"848","citing_paper_count":24,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1189,"insert_date":"20201016","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Predictive models","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Analytical models","Uncertainty","Perturbation methods"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["MAUP","traffic prediction","deep learning","model diagnostic","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Traffic Prediction","Modifiable Areal Unit Problem","Neural Network","Deep Learning","Predictive Performance","Prediction Error","Domain Experts","Dot Plots","Prediction Network","Color Map","Colour Map","Colormap","Network Input","Interactive Visualization","Spatial Association","Interactive Exploration","Root Mean Square Error","Root-mean-square Deviation","Root-mean-square Error","RMSD","RMSE","Airport","Multiple Scales","Spatial Heterogeneity","Spatially Heterogeneous","High Uncertainty","Adversarial Examples","Traffic Volume","Traffic Intensity","High Prediction Errors","Map View","Time Slot","Choropleth Maps","Low Uncertainty","Set Of Data Points","Points In The Dataset","Spatial Units","Yield Prediction","Output Prediction"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030346","title":"V2V: A Deep Learning Approach to Variable-to-Variable Selection and Translation for Multivariate Time-Varying Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":30,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086862620","id":37086862620,"full_name":"Jun Han","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Notre Dame"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086864734","id":37086864734,"full_name":"Hao Zheng","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Notre Dame"]}},{"affiliation":"Sichuan University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087128047","id":37087128047,"full_name":"Yunhao Xing","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sichuan University"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274188200","id":37274188200,"full_name":"Danny Z.

We first utilize a graph representation learning (GRL) model to transform nodes into vectors so that the contextual structures in a network can be effectively extracted and organized. Then, we propose a multi-objective blue noise sampling model to select a subset of nodes in the vectorized space to preserve contextual structures with the retention of relative data and cluster densities in addition to those features of significance, such as bridging nodes and graph connections. We also design a set of visual interfaces enabling users to interactively conduct context-aware sampling, visually compare results with various sampling strategies, and deeply explore large networks.

The main goal of this study is to understand the capability of sampling methods in preserving the density, outliers, and overall shape of a scatterplot. To this end, we comprehensively review the literature and select seven typical sampling strategies as well as eight representative datasets. We then design four experiments to understand the performance of different strategies in maintaining: 1) region density; 2) class density; 3) outliers; and 4) overall shape in the sampling results. The results show that: 1) random sampling is preferred for preserving region density; 2) blue noise sampling and random sampling have comparable performance with the three multi-class sampling strategies in preserving class density; 3) outlier biased density based sampling, recursive subdivision based sampling, and blue noise sampling perform the best in keeping outliers; and 4) blue noise sampling outperforms the others in maintaining the overall shape of a scatterplot.","article_number":"9226404","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9226404","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9226404/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9226404/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1720","end_page":"1730","citing_paper_count":23,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1224,"insert_date":"20201016","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Sampling methods","Task analysis","Shape","Data visualization","Visualization","Bibliographies","Scalability"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Scatterplot","data sampling","empirical evaluation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Sampling Method","Sampling Methods","Evaluation Of Sampling Methods","Random Sampling","Performance Of Different Strategies","Performance Of Different Schemes","Control Experiments","Data Mining","Data-mining","Computer Vision","Relative Density","Specific Gravity","Completion Time","Precision And Recall","Singular Value Decomposition","Friedman Test","Sample Space","Pairwise Relationships","Pairwise Kinship","Computer Graphics","2D Data","Subjective Questionnaire","Class Ratio","Relative Preservation","Average Completion Time","Dimensionality Reduction Approach"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030360","title":"Gemini: A Grammar and Recommender System for Animated Transitions in Statistical Graphics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":33,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Washington","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655997","id":37088655997,"full_name":"Younghoon Kim","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Washington"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550791300","id":37550791300,"full_name":"Jeffrey Heer","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Washington"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Animated transitions help viewers follow changes between related visualizations. Specifying effective animations demands significant effort: authors must select the elements and properties to animate, provide transition parameters, and coordinate the timing of stages. To facilitate this process, we present Gemini, a declarative grammar and recommendation system for animated transitions between single-view statistical graphics. Gemini specifications define transition “steps” in terms of high-level visual components (marks, axes, legends) and composition rules to synchronize and concatenate steps. With this grammar, Gemini can recommend animation designs to augment and accelerate designers' work. Gemini enumerates staged animation designs for given start and end states, and ranks those designs using a cost function informed by prior perceptual studies. To evaluate Gemini, we conduct both a formative study on Mechanical Turk to assess and tune our ranking function, and a summative study in which 8 experienced visualization developers implement animations in D3 that we then compare to Gemini's suggestions. We find that most designs (9/11) are exactly replicable in Gemini, with many (8/11) achievable via edits to suggestions, and that Gemini suggestions avoid multiple participant errors.","article_number":"9234027","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9234027","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9234027/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9234027/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"485","end_page":"494","citing_paper_count":22,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":697,"insert_date":"20201020","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Animation","Data visualization","Grammar","Visualization","Timing","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Animated transition","animation","transition","declarative grammar","automated design","charts"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Recommender Systems","Statistical Graphics","Grammar System","Synchronization","Synchronous","Cost Function","End State","Starting State","Acceptable State","Ranking Function","Field Data","Change Detection","Scoring Function","Marked Changes","User Experience","Intermediate State","Data Transformation","Scale Changes","Heuristic Algorithm","Heuristic Function","Levels In Roots","Object Tracking","Visual Design","Edit Operations","Function Of Duration","Vertical Changes","Visual Encoding","Single View"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3028947","title":"A Fluid Flow Data Set for Machine Learning and its Application to Neural Flow Map Interpolation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":34,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"ETH Zurich, Switzerland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656899","id":37088656899,"full_name":"Jakob Jakob","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["ETH Zurich, Switzerland"]}},{"affiliation":"ETH Zurich, Switzerland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275694700","id":37275694700,"full_name":"Markus Gross","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["ETH Zurich, Switzerland"]}},{"affiliation":"ETH Zurich, Switzerland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085416142","id":37085416142,"full_name":"Tobias Günther","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["ETH Zurich, Switzerland"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In recent years, deep learning has opened countless research opportunities across many different disciplines. At present, visualization is mainly applied to explore and explain neural networks. Its counterpart-the application of deep learning to visualization problems-requires us to share data more openly in order to enable more scientists to engage in data-driven research. In this paper, we construct a large fluid flow data set and apply it to a deep learning problem in scientific visualization. Parameterized by the Reynolds number, the data set contains a wide spectrum of laminar and turbulent fluid flow regimes. The full data set was simulated on a high-performance compute cluster and contains 8000 time-dependent 2D vector fields, accumulating to more than 16 TB in size. Using our public fluid data set, we trained deep convolutional neural networks in order to set a benchmark for an improved post-hoc Lagrangian fluid flow analysis. In in-situ settings, flow maps are exported and interpolated in order to assess the transport characteristics of time-dependent fluids. Using deep learning, we improve the accuracy of flow map interpolations, allowing a more precise flow analysis at a reduced memory IO footprint.","article_number":"9216518","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9216518","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216518/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216518/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1279","end_page":"1289","citing_paper_count":22,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1563,"insert_date":"20201007","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Machine learning","Interpolation","Image resolution","Data visualization","Convolutional neural networks","Feature extraction"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Scientific visualization","deep learning","flow maps"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Machine Learning","Machine-learning","Fluid Flow","Liquid Flow","Fluid Velocity","Flow Map","Flow Dataset","Flow Data Sets","Neural Network","Deep Learning","Convolutional Neural Network","Public Data","Reynolds Number","Flow Analysis","Turbulent Flow","Vector Field","Scientific Visualization","Discretion","Numerical Simulations","Numerical Model","Training Time","Periodic Boundary Conditions","Long Short-term Memory","Long Short Term Memory","LSTM","Fluid Dynamics","Generative Adversarial Networks","Adversarial Learning","Adaptive Sampling","Peak Signal-to-noise Ratio","Peak Signal To Noise Ratio","PSNR","Low-resolution Images","Steady Flow","Unsteady Flow","Interpolation Error","Cubic Interpolation","Ridgeline","Ridge Line","Crest Lines","Interpolation Operator","Convolutional Architecture","Ocean Circulation","Sea Currents"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030343","title":"VisCode: Embedding Information in Visualization Images using Encoder-Decoder Network","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":35,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089259258","id":37089259258,"full_name":"Peiying Zhang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086945430","id":37086945430,"full_name":"Chenhui Li","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38008320400","id":38008320400,"full_name":"Changbo Wang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present an approach called VisCode for embedding information into visualization images.

Prior literature offers guidelines for effective colormap design, such as emphasizing luminance variation while limiting changes in hue. However, empirical studies of color are largely focused on perceptual tasks. This narrow focus inhibits our understanding of how generalizable these guidelines are, particularly to tasks like visual inference that require synthesis and judgement across multiple percepts. Furthermore, the emphasis on traditional ramp designs (e.g., sequential or diverging) may sideline other key metrics or design strategies. We study how a cognitive metric-color name variation-impacts people's ability to make model-based judgments. In two graphical inference experiments, participants saw a series of color-coded scalar fields sampled from different models and assessed the relationships between these models. Contrary to conventional guidelines, participants were more accurate when viewing colormaps that cross a variety of uniquely nameable colors. We modeled participants' performance using this metric and found that it provides a better fit to the experimental data than do existing design principles. Our findings indicate cognitive advantages for colorful maps like rainbow, which exhibit high color categorization, despite their traditionally undesirable perceptual properties. We also found no evidence that color categorization would lead observers to infer false data features. Our results provide empirically grounded metrics for predicting a colormap's performance and suggest alternative guidelines for designing new quantitative colormaps to support inference.

We propose and implement multiple algorithms for each step of the MetroSet pipeline and provide a functional prototype with easy-to-use preset configurations.

Currently, practitioners and researchers have to engage in a tedious and time-consuming process to ensure that their designs scale to screens of different sizes, and existing toolkits and libraries provide little support in diagnosing and repairing issues. To address this challenge, MobileVisFixer automates a mobile-friendly visualization re-design process with a novel reinforcement learning framework. To inform the design of MobileVisFixer, we first collected and analyzed SVG-based visualizations on the web, and identified five common mobile-friendly issues. MobileVisFixer addresses four of these issues on single-view Cartesian visualizations with linear or discrete scales by a Markov Decision Process model that is both generalizable across various visualizations and fully explainable. MobileVisFixer deconstructs charts into declarative formats, and uses a greedy heuristic based on Policy Gradient methods to find solutions to this difficult, multi-criteria optimization problem in reasonable time. In addition, MobileVisFixer can be easily extended with the incorporation of optimization algorithms for data visualizations. Quantitative evaluation on two real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness and generalizability of our method.","article_number":"9229072","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9229072","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9229072/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9229072/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"464","end_page":"474","citing_paper_count":21,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1274,"insert_date":"20201019","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Mobile handsets","Sociology","Statistics","Encoding","Layout"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Mobile visualization","Responsive visualization","Machine learning for visualizations","Reinforcement learning"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Reinforcement Learning Framework","Web Visualization","Optimization Problem","Mobile Devices","Portable Devices","Data Visualization","Markov Decision Process","Policy Gradient Method","REINFORCE Algorithm","Actor-critic Method","Discrete Scale","Markov Decision Process Model","Training Dataset","Training Data Set","Global Scale","Cost Function","Types Of Problems","Set Of Elements","Decision Rules","Design Goals","Policy Learning","Font Size","Screen Size","Visual Design","Visual Encoding","Web-based Visualization","Desktop Version","Mobile Version","Reinforcement Learning Model","Model-based System","Text Labels","Visual Style","Web Content","Unreadable"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030465","title":"Visual Causality Analysis of Event Sequence Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":39,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"iDVx Lab at Tongji University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547579","id":37086547579,"full_name":"Zhuochen Jin","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["iDVx Lab at Tongji University"]}},{"affiliation":"iDVx Lab at Tongji University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547434","id":37086547434,"full_name":"Shunan Guo","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["iDVx Lab at Tongji University"]}},{"affiliation":"iDVx Lab at Tongji University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087408715","id":37087408715,"full_name":"Nan Chen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["iDVx Lab at Tongji University"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268045000","id":37268045000,"full_name":"Daniel Weiskopf","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart"]}},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601397400","id":37601397400,"full_name":"David Gotz","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"]}},{"affiliation":"iDVx Lab at Tongji University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604309600","id":37604309600,"full_name":"Nan Cao","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["iDVx Lab at Tongji University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Causality is crucial to understanding the mechanisms behind complex systems and making decisions that lead to intended outcomes. Event sequence data is widely collected from many real-world processes, such as electronic health records, web clickstreams, and financial transactions, which transmit a great deal of information reflecting the causal relations among event types. Unfortunately, recovering causalities from observational event sequences is challenging, as the heterogeneous and high-dimensional event variables are often connected to rather complex underlying event excitation mechanisms that are hard to infer from limited observations. Many existing automated causal analysis techniques suffer from poor explainability and fail to include an adequate amount of human knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a visual analytics method for recovering causalities in event sequence data. We extend the Granger causality analysis algorithm on Hawkes processes to incorporate user feedback into causal model refinement. The visualization system includes an interactive causal analysis framework that supports bottom-up causal exploration, iterative causal verification and refinement, and causal comparison through a set of novel visualizations and interactions. We report two forms of evaluation: a quantitative evaluation of the model improvements resulting from the user-feedback mechanism, and a qualitative evaluation through case studies in different application domains to demonstrate the usefulness of the system.","article_number":"9222294","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222294","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222294/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222294/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1343","end_page":"1352","citing_paper_count":20,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1428,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Analytical models","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Data models","Layout","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Event sequence data","causality analysis","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Sequence Of Events","Visual Analysis","Causal Analysis","Event Sequence Data","Causal Relationship","Electronic Health Records","Electronic Medical Records","Visual System","Human Cognition","Human Knowledge","Visual Methods","Visual Method","Causal Model","Granger Causality","Granger-causality","User Feedback","Raw Sequencing","Outcome Events","Result Of Events","Graphical Model","Sequence Patterns","Directed Acyclic Graph","Causal Chain","Proportion Of Sequences","Causal Graph","Causal Patterns","Causal Complexity","Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve","Bayesian Information Criterion Score","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Lack Of Interpretability","Lack Of Translation","Temporal Sequence Of Events","Temporal Order Of Events","Graph Layout","Graph Drawing"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030448","title":"Retrieve-Then-Adapt: Example-based Automatic Generation for Proportion-related Infographics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":40,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia, Peking University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655324","id":37088655324,"full_name":"Chunyao Qian","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Peking University"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656739","id":37088656739,"full_name":"Shizhao Sun","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37391623900","id":37391623900,"full_name":"Weiwei Cui","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37288645000","id":37288645000,"full_name":"Jian-Guang Lou","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073639100","id":37073639100,"full_name":"Haidong Zhang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37963085000","id":37963085000,"full_name":"Dongmei Zhang","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Infographic is a data visualization technique which combines graphic and textual descriptions in an aesthetic and effective manner. Creating infographics is a difficult and time-consuming process which often requires significant attempts and adjustments even for experienced designers, not to mention novice users with limited design expertise. Recently, a few approaches have been proposed to automate the creation process by applying predefined blueprints to user information. However, predefined blueprints are often hard to create, hence limited in volume and diversity. In contrast, good infogrpahics have been created by professionals and accumulated on the Internet rapidly. These online examples often represent a wide variety of design styles, and serve as exemplars or inspiration to people who like to create their own infographics. Based on these observations, we propose to generate infographics by automatically imitating examples. We present a two-stage approach, namely retrieve-then-adapt. In the retrieval stage, we index online examples by their visual elements. For a given user information, we transform it to a concrete query by sampling from a learned distribution about visual elements, and then find appropriate examples in our example library based on the similarity between example indexes and the query. For a retrieved example, we generate an initial drafts by replacing its content with user information. However, in many cases, user information cannot be perfectly fitted to retrieved examples. Therefore, we further introduce an adaption stage. Specifically, we propose a MCMC-like approach and leverage recursive neural networks to help adjust the initial draft and improve its visual appearance iteratively, until a satisfactory result is obtained. We implement our approach on widely-used proportion-related infographics, and demonstrate its effectiveness by sample results and expert reviews.","article_number":"9233469","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9233469","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9233469/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9233469/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"443","end_page":"452","citing_paper_count":20,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":858,"insert_date":"20201020","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Layout","Libraries","Tools","Internet","Indexes","Neural networks"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Infographics","automatic visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Automatic Generation","Imitation","Blueprint","Recurrent Neural Network","Expert Review","Visual Elements","Adaptation Stage","Retrieval Stage","Design Style","Paradigm Shift","New Paradigm","Design Process","Markov Chain Monte Carlo","Pieces Of Information","Generative Adversarial Networks","Adversarial Learning","Design Choices","Visual Properties","Visual Attributes","Variational Autoencoder","Font Size","Graphic Design","Pictograms","Pictographs","Graphical Elements","Xeon E5","Intel Xeon E5","Visual Style","Good Starting Points","Blocks Of Text","Hidden Vector","Textual Elements","Design Professionals","Specific Piece Of Information","Particular Piece Of Information","Aspect Ratio"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030456","title":"Cartographic Relief Shading with Neural Networks","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":41,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Monash University, Melbourne","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38488917300","id":38488917300,"full_name":"Bernhard Jenny","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University, Melbourne"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Cartography and Geoinformation, ETH, Zurich","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077839500","id":37077839500,"full_name":"Magnus Heitzler","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Cartography and Geoinformation, ETH, Zurich"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University, Melbourne","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656749","id":37088656749,"full_name":"Dilpreet Singh","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University, Melbourne"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Cartography and Geoinformation, ETH, Zurich","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656069","id":37088656069,"full_name":"Marianna Farmakis-Serebryakova","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Cartography and Geoinformation, ETH, Zurich"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University, Melbourne","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656482","id":37088656482,"full_name":"Jeffery Chieh Liu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University, Melbourne"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Cartography and Geoinformation, ETH, Zurich","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656932","id":37088656932,"full_name":"Lorenz Hurni","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Cartography and Geoinformation, ETH, Zurich"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Shaded relief is an effective method for visualising terrain on topographic maps, especially when the direction of illumination is adapted locally to emphasise individual terrain features.

We replicate hand-drawn relief shading using U-Net neural networks. The deep neural networks are trained with manual shaded relief images of the Swiss topographic map series and terrain models of the same area. The networks generate shaded relief that closely resemble hand-drawn shaded relief art. The networks learn essential design principles from manual relief shading such as removing unnecessary terrain details, locally adjusting the illumination direction to accentuate individual terrain features, and varying brightness to emphasise larger landforms.

However, even the best network layout algorithms ultimately result in ‘hairball’ visualisations when the graph reaches a certain degree of complexity, requiring simplification through aggregation or interaction (such as filtering) to remain usable. Until now, there has been little data to indicate at what level of complexity node-link diagrams become ineffective or how visual complexity affects cognitive load. To this end, we conducted a controlled study to understand workload limits for a task that requires a detailed understanding of the network topology-finding the shortest path between two nodes. We tested performance on graphs with 25 to 175 nodes with varying density. We collected performance measures (accuracy and response time), subjective feedback, and physiological measures (EEG, pupil dilation, and heart rate variability). To the best of our knowledge this is the first network visualisation study to include physiological measures. Our results show that people have significant difficulty finding the shortest path in high density node-link diagrams with more than 50 nodes and even low density graphs with more than 100 nodes. From our collected EEG data we observe functional differences in brain activity between hard and easy tasks. We found that cognitive load increased up to certain level of difficulty after which it decreased, likely because participants had given up. We also explored the effects of global network layout features such as size or number of crossings, and features of the shortest path such as length or straightness on task difficulty. We found that global features generally had a greater impact than those of the shortest path.","article_number":"9290431","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9290431","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9290431/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9290431/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1677","end_page":"1687","citing_paper_count":19,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":823,"insert_date":"20201210","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Task analysis","Data visualization","Particle measurements","Atmospheric measurements","Electroencephalography","Visualization","Physiology"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data Visualisation","Network Visualisation","Cognitive Load","EEG"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Cognitive Load","Cognitive Demands","Mental Workload","Mental Effort","Visual Network","Network Diagram","Cognitive Load Perspective","Cognitive-load Perspective","Response Time","Performance Measures","Brain Activity","Shortest Path","Heart Rate Variability","Task Difficulty","EEG Data","Easy Task","Pupil Size","Pupil Dilation","Mydriasis","Differences In Brain Activity","Straightness","Dilation Rate","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Subjective Feedback","Increase In Cognitive Load","Electrode","Left Frontal Regions","Extraneous Cognitive Load","Frontal Regions","Spatial Task","Load Measurements","Kinds Of Tasks","EEG Data Analysis","Cognitive Load Theory","Pie Chart","Self-reported Difficulties"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030415","title":"Modeling in the Time of COVID-19: Statistical and Rule-based Mesoscale Models","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":43,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656665","id":37088656665,"full_name":"Ngan Nguyen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia"]}},{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656920","id":37088656920,"full_name":"Ondřej Strnad","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Wien and Nanographics GmbH","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086226921","id":37086226921,"full_name":"Tobias Klein","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Wien and Nanographics GmbH"]}},{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656490","id":37088656490,"full_name":"Deng Luo","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia"]}},{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656884","id":37088656884,"full_name":"Ruwayda Alharbi","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia"]}},{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38514733100","id":38514733100,"full_name":"Peter Wonka","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia"]}},{"affiliation":"Scripps Research Institute, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656261","id":37088656261,"full_name":"Martina Maritan","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Scripps Research Institute, US"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Wien and Nanographics GmbH","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086231000","id":37086231000,"full_name":"Peter Mindek","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Wien and Nanographics GmbH"]}},{"affiliation":"Scripps Research Institute, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38488560700","id":38488560700,"full_name":"Ludovic Autin","author_order":9,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Scripps Research Institute, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Scripps Research Institute, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086211853","id":37086211853,"full_name":"David S.

The resulting 3D models are based on a few 2D microscopy scans and the latest knowledge available about the biological entity, represented as a set of geometric relationships. Our new visual-programming technique is based on statistical and rule-based modeling approaches that are rapid to author, fast to construct, and easy to revise. From a few 2D microscopy scans, we determine the statistical properties of various structural aspects, such as the outer membrane shape, the spatial properties, and the distribution characteristics of the macromolecular elements on the membrane. This information is utilized in the construction of the 3D model. Once all the imaging evidence is incorporated into the model, additional information can be incorporated by interactively defining the rules that spatially characterize the rest of the biological entity, such as mutual interactions among macromolecules, and their distances and orientations relative to other structures. These rules are defined through an intuitive 3D interactive visualization as a visual-programming feedback loop. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach on a use case of the modeling procedure of the SARS-CoV-2 virion ultrastructure. This atomistic model, which we present here, can steer biological research to new promising directions in our efforts to fight the spread of the virus.","article_number":"9224865","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9224865","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9224865/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9224865/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"722","end_page":"732","citing_paper_count":18,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2739,"insert_date":"20201015","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Computational modeling","Three-dimensional displays","Biological system modeling","Solid modeling","Proteins","Biomembranes"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["molecular visualization","mesoscale modeling"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Statistical Models","Rule-based Model","Mesoscale Model","Interactive Visualization","Amount Of Protein","Protein Quantification","Membrane Proteins","Electron Microscopy Images","Spike Protein","S Protein","Spike Glycoprotein","Set Of Rules","Normal Vector","Distribution Of Proteins","Viral Capsid","Viral Capsids","Virus Capsid","Viral Core","Virus Core","3D Mesh","Surface Mesh","Collision Detection","Impact Of Monitoring","Collision Checking","Triangular Mesh","Triangle Mesh","3D Interactions","Scientific Relevance","Polyline","Types Of Rules","Outer Contour","Scientific Visualization","Three-dimensional Objects","Common Coordinate System","Nucleoprotein","Contour Segmentation","Siblings","Line Segment","Lipid Bilayer Membrane"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030361","title":"PipelineProfiler: A Visual Analytics Tool for the Exploration of AutoML Pipelines","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":44,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085831490","id":37085831490,"full_name":"Jorge Piazentin Ono","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University"]}},{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655635","id":37088655635,"full_name":"Sonia Castelo","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University"]}},{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656656","id":37088656656,"full_name":"Roque Lopez","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University"]}},{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38267713800","id":38267713800,"full_name":"Enrico Bertini","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University"]}},{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283149600","id":37283149600,"full_name":"Juliana Freire","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University"]}},{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275249200","id":37275249200,"full_name":"Claudio Silva","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In recent years, a wide variety of automated machine learning (AutoML) methods have been proposed to generate end-to-end ML pipelines.

It is also challenging for machine learning experts to select an AutoML system that is well suited for a given problem. In this paper, we present the Pipeline Profiler, an interactive visualization tool that allows the exploration and comparison of the solution space of machine learning (ML) pipelines produced by AutoML systems. PipelineProfiler is integrated with Jupyter Notebook and can be combined with common data science tools to enable a rich set of analyses of the ML pipelines, providing users a better understanding of the algorithms that generated them as well as insights into how they can be improved. We demonstrate the utility of our tool through use cases where PipelineProfiler is used to better understand and improve a real-world AutoML system. Furthermore, we validate our approach by presenting a detailed analysis of a think-aloud experiment with six data scientists who develop and evaluate AutoML tools.","article_number":"9222086","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222086","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222086/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222086/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"390","end_page":"400","citing_paper_count":18,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1139,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Pipelines","Tools","Visual analytics","Machine learning","Data visualization","Search problems","Correlation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Automatic Machine Learning","Pipeline Visualization","Model Evaluation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["AutoML Pipeline","Machine Learning","Machine-learning","Debugging","Jupyter Notebook","Machine Learning Pipeline","Interactive Visualization Tool","Pearson Correlation","Pearson Correlation Coefficient","High Scores","Hyperparameters","Low Scores","Gene Regulatory Networks","Genetic Programming","Genetic Networks","Genetic Pathways","Training Time","Column Vector","Column Of Matrix","Object Detection","Types Of Problems","Mean Of Scores","Prediction Time","Directed Acyclic Graph","Bayesian Optimization","Machine Learning Tasks","Monte Carlo Tree Search","Monte-Carlo Tree Search","Point-biserial Correlation","Point Biserial Correlation Coefficient","Point Biserial Correlation","Point-biserial Correlation Coefficient","Cross-validation Score"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030437","title":"In Search of Patient Zero: Visual Analytics of Pathogen Transmission Pathways in Hospitals","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":45,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"TU Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656048","id":37088656048,"full_name":"T.

An outbreak is generally noticed when the number of infected patients rises above an endemic level or the usual prevalence of a pathogen in a defined population. Reconstructing transmission pathways back to the source of an outbreak - the patient zero or index patient - requires the analysis of microbiological data and patient contacts. This is often manually completed by infection control experts. We present a novel visual analytics approach to support the analysis of transmission pathways, patient contacts, the progression of the outbreak, and patient timelines during hospitalization. Infection control experts applied our solution to a real outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae in a large German hospital. Using our system, our experts were able to scale the analysis of transmission pathways to longer time intervals (i.e., several years of data instead of days) and across a larger number of wards. Also, the system is able to reduce the analysis time from days to hours. In our final study, feedback from twenty-five experts from seven German hospitals provides evidence that our solution brings significant benefits for analyzing outbreaks.","article_number":"9286903","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9286903","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9286903/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9286903/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"711","end_page":"721","citing_paper_count":18,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":990,"insert_date":"20201208","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Hospitals","Pathogens","Data visualization","Task analysis","Visual analytics","Statistics","Sociology"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["dynamic networks","visualization applications","health","medicine","outbreak","Klebsiella","infection control"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Pathogen Transmission","Transmission Pathways","Patient Zero","Patient O","Pathogen Transmission Pathways","Number Of Patients","Infected Patients","Final Study","Index Patient","Patient Contact","Microbiological Data","Levels Of Endemism","Hospital Outbreaks","German Hospitals","Number Of Infected Patients","Interactive","Infection Status","Infection Conditions","Infectious Conditions","Free Text","Potential Transmission","Transmission Events","Effective Transmission","Hospital Wards","Visual Design","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Contact Network","Domain Experts","User-centered","Human-centered Design","User-centered Design","Original Analysis","Outbreak Duration","Comprehensive Way","Comprehensible Way","Critical Contact"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3028957","title":"A Visual Analytics Approach for Exploratory Causal Analysis: Exploration, Validation, and Applications","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":46,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086448603","id":37086448603,"full_name":"Xiao Xie","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085829363","id":37085829363,"full_name":"Fan Du","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"Adobe Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","id":37407308300,"full_name":"Yingcai Wu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Adobe Research"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Using causal relations to guide decision making has become an essential analytical task across various domains, from marketing and medicine to education and social science.

On top of the causal graph, it supports a set of intuitive user controls for performing what-if analyses and making action plans.

Conventional methods for constructing density maps are mainly based on Euclidean distance, limiting their applicability in urban analysis that shall consider road network and urban traffic. In this work, we propose a new method named Topology Density Map, targeting for accurate and intuitive density maps in the context of urban environment. Based on the various constraints of road connections and traffic conditions, the method first constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that propagates nonlinear scalar fields along 1D road networks. Next, the method extends the scalar fields to a 2D space by identifying key intersecting points in the DAG and calculating the scalar fields for every point, yielding a weighted Voronoi diagram like effect of space division. Two case studies demonstrate that the Topology Density Map supplies accurate information to users and provides an intuitive visualization for decision making.

To author interactive visualizations, users must instead turn to textual specification, but such approaches impose a higher technical burden. To bridge this gap, we introduce Lyra 2, a system that extends a prior visualization design environment with novel methods for authoring interaction techniques by demonstration. Users perform an interaction (e.g., button clicks, drags, or key presses) directly on the visualization they are editing. The system interprets this performance using a set of heuristics and enumerates suggestions of possible interaction designs. These heuristics account for the properties of the interaction (e.g., target and event type) as well as the visualization (e.g., mark and scale types, and multiple views). Interaction design suggestions are displayed as thumbnails; users can preview and test these suggestions, iteratively refine them through additional demonstrations, and finally apply and customize them via property inspectors. We evaluate our approach through a gallery of diverse examples, and evaluate its usability through a first-use study and via an analysis of its cognitive dimensions. We find that, in Lyra 2, interaction design by demonstration enables users to rapidly express a wide range of interactive visualizations.","article_number":"9222289","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222289","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222289/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222289/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"304","end_page":"314","citing_paper_count":18,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":851,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Brushes","Programming","Image color analysis","Usability","Tools"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Direct manipulation","interactive visualization","interaction design by demonstration"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive Visualization","Heuristic","Rule Of Thumb","Graphical User Interface","Graphical Interface","Direct Use","Direct Utilization","Direct Manipulation","Interaction Design","Visual Design","Interaction Techniques","Prior Experience","Data Visualization","Design Process","Field Data","Less Experienced","Data Transformation","Level Of Abstraction","Interaction Behavior","Data Space","Mental Models","User Input","Visual Properties","Visual Attributes","Salient Differences","Short Type","Language Of The Text","Textese","Input Events","Visual Encoding","Experiences Of Frustration"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030442","title":"Sequence Braiding: Visual Overviews of Temporal Event Sequences and Attributes","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":49,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Northeastern University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087127234","id":37087127234,"full_name":"Sara Di Bartolomeo","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University"]}},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086544588","id":37086544588,"full_name":"Yixuan Zhang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University","Georgia Institute of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087129444","id":37087129444,"full_name":"Fangfang Sheng","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University"]}},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38350716800","id":38350716800,"full_name":"Cody Dunne","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Temporal event sequence alignment has been used in many domains to visualize nuanced changes and interactions overtime.

In this paper, we present TaxThemis, an interactive visual analytics system to help tax officers mine and explore suspicious tax evasion groups through analyzing heterogeneous tax-related data. A taxpayer network is constructed and fused with the respective trade network to detect suspicious RPTTE groups. Rich visualizations are designed to facilitate the exploration and investigation of suspicious transactions between related taxpayers with profit and topological data analysis. Specifically, we propose a calendar heatmap with a carefully-designed encoding scheme to intuitively show the evidence of transferring revenue through related party transactions.

While other methods separate the creation of colors from their assignment, our approach takes data characteristics into account to produce color palettes, which are then assigned in a way that fosters better visual discrimination of classes. To do so, we use a customized optimization based on simulated annealing to maximize the combination of three carefully designed color scoring functions: point distinctness, name difference, and color discrimination.

However, this assumption is difficult to fulfill in real-world scenarios and creates barriers in reusing existing labels from similar application domains. Transfer Learning is intended to relax this assumption by modeling relationships between domains, and is often applied in deep learning applications to reduce the demand for labeled data and training time. Despite recent advances in exploring deep learning models with visual analytics tools, little work has explored the issue of explaining and diagnosing the knowledge transfer process between deep learning models. In this paper, we present a visual analytics framework for the multi-level exploration of the transfer learning processes when training deep neural networks. Our framework establishes a multi-aspect design to explain how the learned knowledge from the existing model is transferred into the new learning task when training deep neural networks. Based on a comprehensive requirement and task analysis, we employ descriptive visualization with performance measures and detailed inspections of model behaviors from the statistical, instance, feature, and model structure levels. We demonstrate our framework through two case studies on image classification by fine-tuning AlexNets to illustrate how analysts can utilize our framework.","article_number":"9219240","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9219240","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9219240/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9219240/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1385","end_page":"1395","citing_paper_count":16,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":958,"insert_date":"20201009","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Analytical models","Visual analytics","Task analysis","Deep learning","Data models","Neurons","Predictive models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Transfer learning","deep learning","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Transfer Learning","Visual Framework","Transfer Learning Process","Visual Analytics Framework","Neural Network","Machine Learning","Machine-learning","Deep Learning","Learning Models","Deep Neural Network","Image Classification","Knowledge Transfer","Knowledge Flows","Transmission Of Knowledge","Deep Learning Models","Cognitive Learning","Learned Knowledge","AlexNet","Knowledge Transfer Process","Visual Analytics Tool","Model Performance","Convolutional Neural Network","Model Comparison","Target Model","Source Model","Source Domain","Domain Discriminator","Neurons In Layer","Importance Weights","Target Dataset","Target Data Set","Target Domain","Statistical Measures","Similarity Matrix","Similarity Matrices"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030353","title":"Localized Topological Simplification of Scalar Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":53,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Arizona State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086218677","id":37086218677,"full_name":"Jonas Lukasczyk","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Technische Universitat Kaiserslautern","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282573700","id":37282573700,"full_name":"Christoph Garth","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technische Universitat Kaiserslautern"]}},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396008400","id":37396008400,"full_name":"Ross Maciejewski","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Sorbonne Universite, CNRS","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37298870300","id":37298870300,"full_name":"Julien Tierny","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sorbonne Universite, CNRS"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"This paper describes a localized algorithm for the topological simplification of scalar data, an essential pre-processing step of topological data analysis (TDA). Given a scalar field f and a selection of extrema to preserve, the proposed localized topological simplification (LTS) derives a function g that is close to f and only exhibits the selected set of extrema. Specifically, suband superlevel set components associated with undesired extrema are first locally flattened and then correctly embedded into the global scalar field, such that these regions are guaranteed-from a combinatorial perspective-to no longer contain any undesired extrema. In contrast to previous global approaches, LTS only and independently processes regions of the domain that actually need to be simplified, which already results in a noticeable speedup. Moreover, due to the localized nature of the algorithm, LTS can utilize shared-memory parallelism to simplify regions simultaneously with a high parallel efficiency (70%). Hence, LTS significantly improves interactivity for the exploration of simplification parameters and their effect on subsequent topological analysis. For such exploration tasks, LTS brings the overall execution time of a plethora of TDA pipelines from minutes down to seconds, with an average observed speedup over state-of-the-art techniques of up to ×36. Furthermore, in the special case where preserved extrema are selected based on topological persistence, an adapted version of LTS partially computes the persistence diagram and simultaneously simplifies features below a predefined persistence threshold. The effectiveness of LTS, its parallel efficiency, and its resulting benefits for TDA are demonstrated on several simulated and acquired datasets from different application domains, including physics, chemistry, and biomedical imaging.","article_number":"9222093","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222093","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222093/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222093/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"572","end_page":"582","citing_paper_count":16,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":462,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Computational modeling","Parallel processing","Data visualization","Data analysis","Atmospheric measurements","Particle measurements","Topology"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Topological data analysis","scalar data","simplification","feature extraction","parallel computing"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Simple Topology","Scalar Data","Topological Analysis","Parallel Efficiency","Parameter Exploration","Topological Data Analysis","Sublevel Set","Superlevel Sets","Computation Time","Calculation Time","Critical Point","Running Time","Important Measure","Parallelization","Parallel Computing","Simple Algorithm","Gray Line","Grey Line","White Line","End Of Step","End Of Each Step","Levels Of Aggression","Global Order","Merging Algorithm","Merge Tree","Interactive Exploration","Local Order","Inverse Order","Dual-order","Priority Queue","C++ Implementation","Linearithmic Time","Input Constraints"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030471","title":"Visual Analysis of Discrimination in Machine Learning","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":54,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543277","id":37086543277,"full_name":"Qianwen Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656714","id":37088656714,"full_name":"Zhenhua Xu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37090037186","id":37090037186,"full_name":"Chen Zhu-Tian","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085635207","id":37085635207,"full_name":"Yong Wang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"Tsinghua University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406039100","id":37406039100,"full_name":"Shixia Liu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tsinghua University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The growing use of automated decision-making in critical applications, such as crime prediction and college admission, has raised questions about fairness in machine learning.

To reveal detailed information on algorithmic discrimination, DiscriLens identifies a collection of potentially discriminatory itemsets based on causal modeling and classification rules mining. By combining an extended Euler diagram with a matrix-based visualization, we develop a novel set visualization to facilitate the exploration and interpretation of discriminatory itemsets. A user study shows that users can interpret the visually encoded information in DiscriLens quickly and accurately.

Unfortunately, these taxonomies fail when applied to communicative visualizations. Instead, designers often resort to evaluating communicative visualizations from the cognitive efficiency perspective: “can the recipient accurately decode my message/insight?” However, designers are unlikely to be satisfied if the message went `in one ear and out the other.' The consequence of this inconsistency is that it is difficult to design or select between competing options in a principled way. The problem we address is the fundamental mismatch between how designers want to describe their intent, and the language they have. We argue that visualization designers can address this limitation through a learning lens: that the recipient is a student and the designer a teacher. By using learning objectives, designers can better define, assess, and compare communicative visualizations. We illustrate how the learning-based approach provides a framework for understanding a wide array of communicative goals. To understand how the framework can be applied (and its limitations), we surveyed and interviewed members of the Data Visualization Society using their own visualizations as a probe. Through this study we identified the broad range of objectives in communicative visualizations and the prevalence of certain objective types.","article_number":"9222102","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222102","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222102/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222102/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"946","end_page":"956","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":829,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Taxonomy","Task analysis","Visualization","Elbow","Tools","Correlation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Learning objectives","communicative visualization","visualization design"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Visualization","Learning Objectives","Visual Design","Cognitive Efficiency","Design Process","Visual Information","Survey Study","Metacognitive","Visualization Tool","Focus Of This Work","Work Focusing","Multiple Objects","Design Purposes","Intentional Design","Communication Purposes","Communicative Intentions","Complex Objects","Clear Objectives","Specific Insights","Vipassanā","Vipassana","Communication Tasks","Elbow Method","Goal Of Assessment","Visual Literacy"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030347","title":"Integrating Prior Knowledge in Mixed-Initiative Social Network Clustering","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":56,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LRI, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656586","id":37088656586,"full_name":"Alexis Pister","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LRI, France"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Bari, Italy","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37660869300","id":37660869300,"full_name":"Paolo Buono","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bari, Italy"]}},{"affiliation":"Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LRI, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407972900","id":37407972900,"full_name":"Jean-Daniel Fekete","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LRI, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LRI, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283026800","id":37283026800,"full_name":"Catherine Plaisant","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LRI, France","University of Maryland, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LRI, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085717328","id":37085717328,"full_name":"Paola Valdivia","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LRI, France"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We propose a new approach-called PK-clustering-to help social scientists create meaningful clusters in social networks.

Our work introduces a new clustering approach and a visual analytics user interface that address this issue. It is based on a process that 1) captures the prior knowledge of the scientists as a set of incomplete clusters, 2) runs multiple clustering algorithms (similarly to clustering ensemble methods), 3) visualizes the results of all the algorithms ranked and summarized by how well each algorithm matches the prior knowledge, 4) evaluates the consensus between user-selected algorithms and 5) allows users to review details and iteratively update the acquired knowledge. We describe our approach using an initial functional prototype, then provide two examples of use and early feedback from social scientists.

For example, changing the chart style or type or a data value in a chart image practically requires creating a completely new chart, which is often a time-consuming and error-prone process. To assist these tasks, many approaches have been proposed to automatically extract information from chart images with computer vision and machine learning techniques. Although they have achieved promising preliminary results, there are still a lot of challenges to overcome in terms of robustness and accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel alternative approach called Chartem to address this issue directly from the root. Specifically, we design a data-embedding schema to encode a significant amount of information into the background of a chart image without interfering human perception of the chart. The embedded information, when extracted from the image, can enable a variety of visualization applications to reuse or repurpose chart images. To evaluate the effectiveness of Chartem, we conduct a user study and performance experiments on Chartem embedding and extraction algorithms. We further present several prototype applications to demonstrate the utility of Chartem.","article_number":"9293003","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9293003","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9293003/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9293003/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"337","end_page":"346","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":889,"insert_date":"20201214","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data mining","Watermarking","Visualization","Image color analysis","Image coding","Bars","Prototypes"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Chart embedding","background embedding","data embedding","chart image","chart reuse"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Embedding","Chart Images","Information Extraction","User Study","Background Image","Chart Types","Prototype Application","Precision And Recall","Natural Images","Bar Charts","Average Position","Pie Chart","Background Regions","QR Code","Sequence Blocks","Background Pixels","Data Block","Host Signaling","Chart Data","Line Chart","Arbitrary Data","Cyclic Redundancy Check","JPEG Compression","Steganography","Visual Chart","Foreground Pixels","Foreground Regions","Random Bits","Visually Impaired People","Pixel Block"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3029413","title":"A Design Space of Vision Science Methods for Visualization Research","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":59,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"The University of British Columbia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086617608","id":37086617608,"full_name":"Madison A.

These efforts provide scientific grounding to complement design intuitions, leading to more effective visualization practice. However, published visualization research currently reflects a limited set of available methods for understanding how people process visualized data. Alternative methods from vision science offer a rich suite of tools for understanding visualizations, but no curated collection of these methods exists in either perception or visualization research. We introduce a design space of experimental methods for empirically investigating the perceptual processes involved with viewing data visualizations to ultimately inform visualization design guidelines. This paper provides a shared lexicon for facilitating experimental visualization research. We discuss popular experimental paradigms, adjustment types, response types, and dependent measures used in vision science research, rooting each in visualization examples. We then discuss the advantages and limitations of each technique. Researchers can use this design space to create innovative studies and progress scientific understanding of design choices and evaluations in visualization. We highlight a history of collaborative success between visualization and vision science research and advocate for a deeper relationship between the two fields that can elaborate on and extend the methodological design space for understanding visualization and vision.","article_number":"9237132","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9237132","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9237132/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9237132/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1117","end_page":"1127","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":822,"insert_date":"20201022","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Correlation","Task analysis","Psychology","Collaboration"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Perception","human vision","empirical research","evaluation","HCI"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Vision Research","Design Space","Vision Science","Experimental Methods","Experimental Method","Experimental Research","Type Of Response","Dependent Measures","Visual Design","Perception Research","Direct Measurement","Cardinality","Set Size","Change Detection","Working Memory","Visual Processing","Target Image","Properties Of Data","Data Attributes","Visual Search","Visual Scanning","Psychophysics","Visual Scene","Adjustment Method","Adjustment Methods","Rapid Serial Visual Presentation","Just Noticeable Difference","Just-noticeable-difference","Stimulus Level","Levels Of Stimuli","Method Of Constant Stimuli","Aspects Of Perception","2AFC Task","Signal Detection Theory","Detection Theory","Search Task","Chart Types","Visual System"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030408","title":"Visual Analytics for Temporal Hypergraph Model Exploration","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":60,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656787","id":37088656787,"full_name":"Maximilian T.

This is because hypergraphs generalize graphs by extending edges to connect any number of vertices, allowing complex relationships to be described more accurately and predict their behavior over time. However, the interactive exploration and seamless refinement of such hypergraph-based prediction models still pose a major challenge. We contribute Hyper-Matrix, a novel visual analytics technique that addresses this challenge through a tight coupling between machine-learning and interactive visualizations. In particular, the technique incorporates a geometric deep learning model as a blueprint for problem-specific models while integrating visualizations for graph-based and category-based data with a novel combination of interactions for an effective user-driven exploration of hypergraph models. To eliminate demanding context switches and ensure scalability, our matrix-based visualization provides drill-down capabilities across multiple levels of semantic zoom, from an overview of model predictions down to the content. We facilitate a focused analysis of relevant connections and groups based on interactive user-steering for filtering and search tasks, a dynamically modifiable partition hierarchy, various matrix reordering techniques, and interactive model feedback. We evaluate our technique in a case study and through formative evaluation with law enforcement experts using real-world internet forum communication data. The results show that our approach surpasses existing solutions in terms of scalability and applicability, enables the incorporation of domain knowledge, and allows for fast search-space traversal. With the proposed technique, we pave the way for the visual analytics of temporal hypergraphs in a wide variety of domains.","article_number":"9222341","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222341","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222341/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222341/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"550","end_page":"560","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":890,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Computational modeling","Machine learning","Predictive models","Analytical models","Semantics","Data models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Hypergraph","communication analysis","geometric deep learning","semantic zoom","matrix ordering","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Temporal Model","Hypergraph Model","Machine Learning","Machine-learning","Deep Learning","Learning Models","Cognitive Domains","Domain Knowledge","Interaction Model","Real-world Data","Explanatory Model","Formal Evaluation","Model Refinement","Interactive Visualization","Search Task","Interactive Exploration","Internet Forums","Internet Forum","Regular Graphs","Zoom Level","Wide Variety Of Domains","Domain Experts","Link Prediction","Mental Models","Arrowheads","Arrowhead","Number Of Time Steps","Number Of Timesteps","Undirected","Undirected Graph","Temporal Prediction","Temporal Anticipation","Related Topics","Related Themes","Related Subjects","External Knowledge","Incidence Matrix","Incidence Matrices"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3028975","title":"A Survey of Text Alignment Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":61,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655318","id":37088655318,"full_name":"Tariq Yousef","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38243241100","id":38243241100,"full_name":"Stefan Janicke","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Text alignment is one of the fundamental techniques text-related domains like natural language processing, computational linguistics, and digital humanities.

We then identify the diverse aspects of comparative layouts, such as the advantages and concerns of using each layout in the real-world scenarios and researchers' approaches to overcome the concerns. Building our knowledge on top of the initial insights gained from the Gleicher et al.'s survey [19], we elaborate on relevant empirical evidence that we distilled from our survey (e.g., the actual effectiveness of the layouts in different study settings) and identify novel facets that the original work did not cover (e.g., the familiarity of the layouts to people).

Extending recent work applying Bayesian models to understand and evaluate belief updating from visualizations, we show how the predictions of Bayesian inference can be used to guide more rational belief updating. We design a Bayesian inference-assisted uncertainty analogy that numerically relates uncertainty in observed data to the user's subjective uncertainty, and a posterior visualization that prescribes how a user should update their beliefs given their prior beliefs and the observed data. In a pre-registered experiment on 4,800 people, we find that when a newly observed data sample is relatively small (N=158), both techniques reliably improve people's Bayesian updating on average compared to the current best practice of visualizing uncertainty in the observed data. For large data samples (N=5208), where people's updated beliefs tend to deviate more strongly from the prescriptions of a Bayesian model, we find evidence that the effectiveness of the two forms of Bayesian assistance may depend on people's proclivity toward trusting the source of the data. We discuss how our results provide insight into individual processes of belief updating and subjective uncertainty, and how understanding these aspects of interpretation paves the way for more sophisticated interactive visualizations for analysis and communication.","article_number":"9216507","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9216507","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216507/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216507/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"989","end_page":"999","citing_paper_count":13,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":586,"insert_date":"20201007","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Bayes methods","Data visualization","Uncertainty","Data models","Cognition","Mathematical model","Predictive models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Bayesian cognition","Belief updating","Uncertainty visualization","Adaptive visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Visualization","Bayesian Inference","Bayesian Methods","Bayesian Analysis","Bayesian Method","Bayesian Model","Bayesian Approach","Bayesian Network","Amount Of Information","Reliable Improvement","People's Beliefs","Belief Updating","Dementia","Large Datasets","Large Data Sets","Posterior Probability","Posterior Distribution","Point Estimates","Cohen’s D","Small Datasets","Small Data Sets","Uncertainty Estimation","Likelihood Function","Kullback-Leibler","Relative Entropy","Kullback Leibler","Kullback Leibler Divergence","Kullback-Leibler Divergence","KL Divergence","Bayesian Framework","Sub-models","Beta Distribution","Beta Prior","Visual Conditions","Visual Status","Posterior Beliefs","Local Updates","Normative Beliefs","Bayesian Belief","Analogous Conditions","Parallel Conditions","Visual Communication","Bayesian Techniques","Bayesian Reasoning","Bayesian Logic","Belief Formation","Visual Interpretation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030380","title":"HyperTendril: Visual Analytics for User-Driven Hyperparameter Optimization of Deep Neural Networks","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":64,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Clova AI Research, NAVER Corporation","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656580","id":37088656580,"full_name":"Heungseok Park","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Clova AI Research, NAVER Corporation"]}},{"affiliation":"Clova AI Research, NAVER Corporation","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656922","id":37088656922,"full_name":"Yoonsoo Nam","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Clova AI Research, NAVER Corporation"]}},{"affiliation":"Clova AI Research, NAVER Corporation","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37657363200","id":37657363200,"full_name":"Ji-Hoon Kim","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Clova AI Research, NAVER Corporation"]}},{"affiliation":"KAIST","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37602784600","id":37602784600,"full_name":"Jaegul Choo","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["KAIST"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"To mitigate the pain of manually tuning hyperparameters of deep neural networks, automated machine learning (AutoML) methods have been developed to search for an optimal set of hyperparameters in large combinatorial search spaces.

To guarantee the high quality of such learning materials, question designers need to inspect how students' problem-solving processes unfold step by step to infer whether students' problem-solving logic matches their design intent. They also need to compare the behaviors of different groups (e.g., students from different grades) to distribute questions to students with the right level of knowledge. The availability of fine-grained interaction data, such as mouse movement trajectories from the online platforms, provides the opportunity to analyze problem-solving behaviors. However, it is still challenging to interpret, summarize, and compare the high dimensional problem-solving sequence data. In this paper, we present a visual analytics system, QLens, to help question designers inspect detailed problem-solving trajectories, compare different student groups, distill insights for design improvements. In particular, QLens models problem-solving behavior as a hybrid state transition graph and visualizes it through a novel glyph-embedded Sankey diagram, which reflects students' problem-solving logic, engagement, and encountered difficulties. We conduct three case studies and three expert interviews to demonstrate the usefulness of QLens on real-world datasets that consist of thousands of problem-solving traces.","article_number":"9222360","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222360","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222360/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222360/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"870","end_page":"880","citing_paper_count":13,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":742,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Problem-solving","Hidden Markov models","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Task analysis","Programming"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Learning Behavior Analysis","Visual Analytics","Time Series Data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Group Of Students","Visual System","Learning Materials","Online Teaching","Online Instruction","Online Education","Problem-solving Skills","Learning Platform","Virtual Learning Environment","Expert Interviews","Hybrid State","Hybridization Conditions","Problem-solving Process","Mouse Movements","Movements In Mice","Sankey Diagram","Sankey Plot","Sequence Of Events","State Space","State-space","Number Of Students","Hidden Markov Model","Interactive System","Bounding Box","Analysis Tasks","Visual Design","Different Groups Of Students","Domain Experts","Incorrect Answers","Common Errors","Trajectory Length","Trajectory Lengths","Elapsed Time","Thousands Of Students","Binary Bits","Common Answer"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030433","title":"Data Comics for Reporting Controlled User Studies in Human-Computer Interaction","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":66,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"The University of Edinburgh","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655932","id":37088655932,"full_name":"Zezhong Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The University of Edinburgh"]}},{"affiliation":"Stanford University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100276","id":37087100276,"full_name":"Jacob Ritchie","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Stanford University"]}},{"affiliation":"The University of Edinburgh and Tianjin University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655445","id":37088655445,"full_name":"Jingtao Zhou","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The University of Edinburgh and Tianjin University"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Toronto","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37395495900","id":37395495900,"full_name":"Fanny Chevalier","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Toronto"]}},{"affiliation":"The University of Edinburgh","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085687578","id":37085687578,"full_name":"Benjamin Bach","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The University of Edinburgh"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Inspired by data comics, this paper introduces a novel format for reporting controlled studies in the domain of human-computer interaction (HCI). While many studies in HCI follow similar steps in explaining hypotheses, laying out a study design, and reporting results, many of these decisions are buried in blocks of dense scientific text. We propose leveraging data comics as study reports to provide an open and glanceable view of studies by tightly integrating text and images, illustrating design decisions and key insights visually, resulting in visual narratives that can be compelling to non-scientists and researchers alike. Use cases of data comics study reports range from illustrations for non-scientific audiences to graphical abstracts, study summaries, technical talks, textbooks, teaching, blogs, supplementary submission material, and inclusion in scientific articles. This paper provides examples of data comics study reports alongside a graphical repertoire of examples, embedded in a framework of guidelines for creating comics reports which was iterated upon and evaluated through a series of collaborative design sessions.","article_number":"9222287","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222287","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222287/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222287/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"967","end_page":"977","citing_paper_count":13,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1176,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Human computer interaction","Guidelines","Jacobian matrices","Blogs"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Statistical communication","comics","scientific reports"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Human Computer Interaction Studies","Human-computer Interaction Studies","Controlled User Study","Controlled User-study","Narrative","Audience","Graphical Abstract","Study Domain","Collaborative Design","Interactive","Experimental Setup","Data Visualization","Effective Communication","Discussion Of The Results","Storytelling","Data Transformation","Public Engagement","Important Details","Design Solutions","Identification Of Solutions","Scientific Results","Scientific Outcomes","Visual Explanation","Complex Stimuli","Complex Stimulus","Different Levels Of Detail","Visual Style","Task Completion Time","Design Objectives","Study Setup","Interface Components","User Interface Components","Project Website","Project Site"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030472","title":"Chemicals in the Creek: designing a situated data physicalization of open government data with the community","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":67,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"MIT Media Lab, Art+Design at Northeastern University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088640457","id":37088640457,"full_name":"Laura J.

The resulting installation, Chemicals in the Creek, responds to the call for community-engaged visualization processes and provides an application of situated methods of data representation. It proposes event-centered and power-aware modes of engagement using contextual and embodied data representations. The design of Chemicals in the Creek is grounded in interactive workshops and we analyze it through event observation, interviews, and community outcomes.

Visualization literacy skills are vital in understanding the world around us and constructing meaningful visualizations, yet, how to better develop these skills at an early age remains largely overlooked and understudied. Only recently has the visualization community started to fill this gap, resulting in preliminary studies and development of educational tools for use in early education. We add to these efforts through the exploration of gamification to support learning, and identify an opportunity to apply role-playing game-based designs by leveraging the presence of narratives in data-related problems involving visualizations. We study the effects of including narrative elements on learning through a technology probe, grounded in a set of design considerations stemming from visualization, game design and education science. We create two versions of a game - one with narrative elements and one without - and evaluate our instances on 33 child participants between 11- to 13-years old using a between-subjects study design. Despite participants requiring double the amount of time to complete their game due to additional narrative elements, the inclusion of such elements were found to improve engagement without sacrificing learning; our results indicate no significant differences in development of graph-reading skills, but significant differences in engagement and overall enjoyment of the game. We report observations and qualitative feedback collected, and note areas for improvement and room for future work.","article_number":"9222251","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222251","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222251/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222251/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"924","end_page":"934","citing_paper_count":12,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1556,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Games","Education","Visualization","Computer science","Tools","Probes"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization Literacy","Educational technology","Gamification","Narrative"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Role-playing Games","Visual Literacy","Literacy In Young Children","Gamification","Early Education","Early Childhood Teachers","Early Childhood Education","Design Considerations","Child Participants","Participation Of Children","Game Design","Narrative Elements","Inclusion Of Elements","Version Of The Game","Data Visualization","Participants In Condition","Status Of Participants","Educational Activities","Educational Content","Instructional Content","Pedagogical Content","Teaching Content","Learning Objectives","Multiple-choice Questions","Multiple Choice Questions","Types Of Questions","Reading Comprehension","Serious Games","Word Problems","Game World","Game-world","Game Mechanics","Role Of Narratives","Simple Story","Narrative Events","Effects Of Narratives","Aspects Of The Game","Visual Design","Affective Learning"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030443","title":"CAVA: A Visual Analytics System for Exploratory Columnar Data Augmentation Using Knowledge Graphs","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":70,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Tufts University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086047966","id":37086047966,"full_name":"Dylan Cashman","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tufts University"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Tech.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655982","id":37088655982,"full_name":"Shenyu Xu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Tech."]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Tech.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086216294","id":37086216294,"full_name":"Subhajit Das","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Tech."]}},{"affiliation":"University of Wisconsin, Madison","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490630000","id":38490630000,"full_name":"Florian Heimerl","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Wisconsin, Madison"]}},{"affiliation":"Tufts University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656478","id":37088656478,"full_name":"Cong Liu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tufts University"]}},{"affiliation":"San Francisco State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085489953","id":37085489953,"full_name":"Shah Rukh Humayoun","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["San Francisco State University"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Wisconsin, Madison","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282585700","id":37282585700,"full_name":"Michael Gleicher","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Wisconsin, Madison"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Tech.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681759500","id":37681759500,"full_name":"Alex Endert","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Tech."]}},{"affiliation":"Tufts University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592409400","id":37592409400,"full_name":"Remco Chang","author_order":9,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tufts University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Most visual analytics systems assume that all foraging for data happens before the analytics process; once analysis begins, the set of data attributes considered is fixed. Such separation of data construction from analysis precludes iteration that can enable foraging informed by the needs that arise in-situ during the analysis. The separation of the foraging loop from the data analysis tasks can limit the pace and scope of analysis. In this paper, we present CAVA, a system that integrates data curation and data augmentation with the traditional data exploration and analysis tasks, enabling information foraging in-situ during analysis. Identifying attributes to add to the dataset is difficult because it requires human knowledge to determine which available attributes will be helpful for the ensuing analytical tasks. CAVA crawls knowledge graphs to provide users with a a broad set of attributes drawn from external data to choose from. Users can then specify complex operations on knowledge graphs to construct additional attributes. CAVA shows how visual analytics can help users forage for attributes by letting users visually explore the set of available data, and by serving as an interface for query construction. It also provides visualizations of the knowledge graph itself to help users understand complex joins such as multi-hop aggregations. We assess the ability of our system to enable users to perform complex data combinations without programming in a user study over two datasets. We then demonstrate the generalizability of CAVA through two additional usage scenarios. The results of the evaluation confirm that CAVA is effective in helping the user perform data foraging that leads to improved analysis outcomes, and offer evidence in support of integrating data augmentation as a part of the visual analytics pipeline.","article_number":"9222249","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222249","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222249/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222249/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1731","end_page":"1741","citing_paper_count":12,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":870,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Task analysis","Visual analytics","Machine learning","Data models","Data visualization","Google","Training"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analytics","Information Foraging","Data Augmentation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Data Augmentation","Visual Analytics System","Foraging","Visual System","User Study","Analysis Tasks","External Data","Usage Scenarios","Data Analysis Tasks","Regression Model","Prediction Model","Machine Learning","Machine-learning","Training Set","Machine Learning Models","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Nodes In The Graph","Domain Experts","Inflation Rate","List Of Attributes","List Of Properties","Nominal GDP","Nominal Gross Domestic Product","County Area","Types Of Queries","Users In The Dataset","Visual Analytics Tool","Properties Of The Dataset","Attributes In The Dataset","Practical Tasks","User Satisfaction","Workflow"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030411","title":"Co-Bridges: Pair-wise Visual Connection and Comparison for Multi-item Data Streams","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":71,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Fudan University, School of data science, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085387892","id":37085387892,"full_name":"Siming Chen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fudan University, School of data science, China","Fraunhofer Institute IAIS, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer Institute IAIS, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047700","id":37283047700,"full_name":"Natalia Andrienko","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute IAIS, Germany","Fraunhofer Institute IAIS, City, University of London, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer Institute IAIS, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047100","id":37283047100,"full_name":"Gennady Andrienko","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute IAIS, Germany","Fraunhofer Institute IAIS, City, University of London, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Tianjin University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085431300","id":37085431300,"full_name":"Jie Li","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tianjin University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Peking University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403856700","id":37403856700,"full_name":"Xiaoru Yuan","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Peking University, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In various domains, there are abundant streams or sequences of multi-item data of various kinds, e.g. streams of news and social media texts, sequences of genes and sports events, etc. Comparison is an important and general task in data analysis. For comparing data streams involving multiple items (e.g., words in texts, actors or action types in action sequences, visited places in itineraries, etc.), we propose Co-Bridges, a visual design involving connection and comparison techniques that reveal similarities and differences between two streams. Co-Bridges use river and bridge metaphors, where two sides of a river represent data streams, and bridges connect temporally or sequentially aligned segments of streams. Commonalities and differences between these segments in terms of involvement of various items are shown on the bridges. Interactive query tools support the selection of particular stream subsets for focused exploration. The visualization supports both qualitative (common and distinct items) and quantitative (stream volume, amount of item involvement) comparisons. We further propose Comparison-of-Comparisons, in which two or more Co-Bridges corresponding to different selections are juxtaposed. We test the applicability of the Co-Bridges in different domains, including social media text streams and sports event sequences.

Our flexible curve traverses the data elements in the spatial domain in a way that the resulting linearization better preserves features in space compared to existing methods. We achieve such data coherency by calculating a Hamiltonian path that approximately minimizes an objective function that describes the similarity of data values and location coherency in a neighborhood. Our extended variant even supports multiscale data via quadtrees and octrees. Our method is useful in many areas of visualization including multivariate or comparative visualization ensemble visualization of 2D and 3D data on regular grids or multiscale visual analysis of particle simulations.

Thus it can help new developers, managers, and testers understand the history of development without needing to dig into a large pile of unfamiliar source code. However, the current tools for Git visualization are not adequate to analyze and explore the metadata: They focus mainly on improving the usability of Git commands instead of on helping users understand the development history. Furthermore, they do not scale for large and complex Git commit graphs, which can play an important role in understanding the overall development history. In this paper, we present Githru, an interactive visual analytics system that enables developers to effectively understand the context of development history through the interactive exploration of Git metadata. We design an interactive visual encoding idiom to represent a large Git graph in a scalable manner while preserving the topological structures in the Git graph. To enable scalable exploration of a large Git commit graph, we propose novel techniques (graph reconstruction, clustering, and Context-Preserving Squash Merge (CSM) methods) to abstract a large-scale Git commit graph. Based on these Git commit graph abstraction techniques, Githru provides an interactive summary view to help users gain an overview of the development history and a comparison view in which users can compare different clusters of commits. The efficacy of Githru has been demonstrated by case studies with domain experts using real-world, in-house datasets from a large software development team at a major international IT company. A controlled user study with 12 developers comparing Githru to previous tools also confirms the effectiveness of Githru in terms of task completion time.","article_number":"9222261","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222261","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222261/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222261/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"656","end_page":"666","citing_paper_count":11,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":3143,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["History","Metadata","Software","Visualization","Interviews","Tools","Complexity theory"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["git","history","exploration","overview","repository","visualization","cluster","DAG"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Evolutionary History","Historical Development","Software Development","Metadata Analysis","Source Code","Data Compression","Historical Context","Domain Experts","Interactive Visualization","Historical Overview","In-house Dataset","In-house Data Set","IT Companies","Professional Development","Cloud Data","Word Cloud","Word Clouds","Analysis Tasks","Software Engineering","Software Technology","Main Stem","Directed Acyclic Graph","Scalability Issues","Cluster A","Target User","Stem Structure","Preliminary Interviews","Bar Length","Merging Algorithm","Merge Tree","Software Projects"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030381","title":"Efficient and Flexible Hierarchical Data Layouts for a Unified Encoding of Scalar Field Precision and Resolution","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":74,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086323906","id":37086323906,"full_name":"Duong Hoang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SCI Institute, University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"Tulane Universiy","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38288824300","id":38288824300,"full_name":"Brian Summa","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tulane Universiy"]}},{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Center for Applied Scientific Computing","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37863152400","id":37863152400,"full_name":"Harsh Bhatia","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Center for Applied Scientific Computing"]}},{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Center for Applied Scientific Computing","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37269320000","id":37269320000,"full_name":"Peter Lindstrom","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Center for Applied Scientific Computing"]}},{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085718422","id":37085718422,"full_name":"Pavol Klacansky","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SCI Institute, University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085735276","id":37085735276,"full_name":"Will Usher","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SCI Institute, University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Center for Applied Scientific Computing","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564112000","id":37564112000,"full_name":"Peer-Timo Bremer","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Center for Applied Scientific Computing"]}},{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284312600","id":37284312600,"full_name":"Valerio Pascucci","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SCI Institute, University of Utah"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"To address the problem of ever-growing scientific data sizes making data movement a major hindrance to analysis, we introduce a novel encoding for scalar fields: a unified tree of resolution and precision, specifically constructed so that valid cuts correspond to sensible approximations of the original field in the precision-resolution space.

Despite an abundance of literature on data wrangling in the context of enterprise data analysis, little is known about the specific operations, processes, and pain points journalists encounter while performing this tedious, time-consuming task. To better understand the needs of this user group, we conduct a technical observation study of 50 public repositories of data and analysis code authored by 33 professional journalists at 26 news organizations. We develop two detailed and cross-cutting taxonomies of data wrangling in computational journalism, for actions and for processes. We observe the extensive use of multiple tables, a notable gap in previous wrangling analyses. We develop a concise, actionable framework for general multi-table data wrangling that includes wrangling operations documented in our taxonomy that are without clear parallels in other work. This framework, the first to incorporate tables as first-class objects, will support future interactive wrangling tools for both computational journalism and general-purpose use. We assess the generative and descriptive power of our framework through discussion of its relationship to our set of taxonomies.","article_number":"9229515","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9229515","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9229515/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9229515/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"957","end_page":"966","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":693,"insert_date":"20201019","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Journalism","Taxonomy","Tools","Data analysis","Encoding","Task analysis","Cleaning"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Computational journalism","Data journalism","Data wrangling"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Framework","Computational Journalism","Data Wrangling","DataWrangler","Data Munging","Power Generation","Electricity Generation","Interactive Tool","News Organizations","Future Tools","Use Of Tables","Pain Points","Enterprise Data","Open-source Software","Open Software","Open Source Software","Open Coding","Programming Language","Water Use","Water-use","Clean Data","US States","Design Space","Multiple Data Sources","Data Analysis Process","Observational Datasets","Observational Data Sets","Axial Coding","Structured Query Language","Merged Data Set","Merging Datasets","Data Journalism","Diary Data","Data-driven Journalism","Single Column","Qualitative Coding","Transformation Operations","Scripting Language","Class Of Operators","Technical Artifacts","Technical Artefacts"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3029412","title":"A Bayesian cognition approach for belief updating of correlation judgement through uncertainty visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":77,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina, Charlotte","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085510179","id":37085510179,"full_name":"Alireza Karduni","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of North Carolina, Charlotte"]}},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina, Charlotte","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655617","id":37088655617,"full_name":"Douglas Markant","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of North Carolina, Charlotte"]}},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina, Charlotte","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086557669","id":37086557669,"full_name":"Ryan Wesslen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of North Carolina, Charlotte"]}},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina, Charlotte","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606064200","id":37606064200,"full_name":"Wenwen Dou","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of North Carolina, Charlotte"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Understanding correlation judgement is important to designing effective visualizations of bivariate data. Prior work on correlation perception has not considered how factors including prior beliefs and uncertainty representation impact such judgements. The present work focuses on the impact of uncertainty communication when judging bivariate visualizations. Specifically, we model how users update their beliefs about variable relationships after seeing a scatterplot with and without uncertainty representation. To model and evaluate the belief updating, we present three studies. Study 1 focuses on a proposed “Line + Cone” visual elicitation method for capturing users' beliefs in an accurate and intuitive fashion. The findings reveal that our proposed method of belief solicitation reduces complexity and accurately captures the users' uncertainty about a range of bivariate relationships. Study 2 leverages the “Line + Cone” elicitation method to measure belief updating on the relationship between different sets of variables when seeing correlation visualization with and without uncertainty representation. We compare changes in users beliefs to the predictions of Bayesian cognitive models which provide normative benchmarks for how users should update their prior beliefs about a relationship in light of observed data. The findings from Study 2 revealed that one of the visualization conditions with uncertainty communication led to users being slightly more confident about their judgement compared to visualization without uncertainty information. Study 3 builds on findings from Study 2 and explores differences in belief update when the bivariate visualization is congruent or incongruent with users' prior belief. Our results highlight the effects of incorporating uncertainty representation, and the potential of measuring belief updating on correlation judgement with Bayesian cognitive models.","article_number":"9217952","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9217952","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9217952/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9217952/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"978","end_page":"988","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":743,"insert_date":"20201008","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Correlation","Uncertainty","Bayes methods","Cognition","Data models","Visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Information visualization","Bayesian modeling","uncertainty visualizations","correlations","belief elicitation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Bayesian Model","Bayesian Approach","Bayesian Network","Belief Updating","Uncertainty Visualization","Data Visualization","Visual Conditions","Visual Status","Impact Of Communication","Elicitation Methods","Elicitation Method","Representation Of Uncertainty","Bivariate Data","Uncertainty Communication","Dependent Variable","Bayesian Inference","Bayesian Methods","Bayesian Analysis","Bayesian Method","Posterior Probability","Posterior Distribution","Bayesian Framework","Strength Of Evidence","Pairs Of Variables","Posterior Mean","Uncertainty Reduction","Degree Of Belief","Subjective Beliefs","Posterior Beliefs","Kullback-Leibler Distance","KL Distance","Kullback Leibler Distance","Prior Mean","People's Beliefs","Sampling Uncertainty","Numerous Reasons","Numerical Reasoning","Differences In Beliefs","Amount Of Uncertainty","Attention Checks","Plausible Alternatives"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030441","title":"TopoMap: A 0-dimensional Homology Preserving Projection of High-Dimensional Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":78,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38228713200","id":38228713200,"full_name":"Harish Doraiswamy","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University"]}},{"affiliation":"CNRS and Sorbonne Université","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37298870300","id":37298870300,"full_name":"Julien Tierny","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["CNRS and Sorbonne Université"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Campinas","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655615","id":37088655615,"full_name":"Paulo J.

With very few exceptions, projection techniques are designed to map data from a high-dimensional space to a visual space so as to preserve some dissimilarity (similarity) measure, such as the Euclidean distance for example. In fact, although adopting distinct mathematical formulations designed to favor different aspects of the data, most multidimensional projection methods strive to preserve dissimilarity measures that encapsulate geometric properties such as distances or the proximity relation between data objects. However, geometric relations are not the only interesting property to be preserved in a projection. For instance, the analysis of particular structures such as clusters and outliers could be more reliably performed if the mapping process gives some guarantee as to topological invariants such as connected components and loops. This paper introduces TopoMap, a novel projection technique which provides topological guarantees during the mapping process. In particular, the proposed method performs the mapping from a high-dimensional space to a visual space, while preserving the 0-dimensional persistence diagram of the Rips filtration of the high-dimensional data, ensuring that the filtrations generate the same connected components when applied to the original as well as projected data.

To understand what causes or deteriorates a disease and identify related biomarkers, clinical researchers regularly perform large-scale cohort studies, requiring the comparison of such data at cellular level. In such studies, with little a-priori knowledge of what to expect in the data, explorative data analysis is a necessity. Here, we present an interactive visual analysis workflow for the comparison of cohorts of spatially-resolved omics-data. Our workflow allows the comparative analysis of two cohorts based on multiple levels-of-detail, from simple abundance of contained cell types over complex co-localization patterns to individual comparison of complete tissue images. As a result, the workflow enables the identification of cohort-differentiating features, as well as outlier samples at any stage of the workflow. During the development of the workflow, we continuously consulted with domain experts. To show the effectiveness of the workflow, we conducted multiple case studies with domain experts from different application areas and with different data modalities.","article_number":"9241732","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9241732","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9241732/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9241732/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"733","end_page":"743","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1271,"insert_date":"20201028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Image segmentation","Biomedical imaging","Spatial databases","Task analysis","Tools"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Imaging Mass Cytometry","Vectra","spatially-resolved data","single-cell omics-data","Visual comparison"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Comparison","Comparison Cohort","Cell Types","Cell-type","Domain Experts","Comparison Of Images","Comparable Image","Interactive Visualization","Spatial Interaction","Co-location Patterns","Heatmap","Goal Of This Study","Alzheimer’s Disease","CD8 T Cells","Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes","Cytotoxic T Cells","Amyloid Plaques","Neuritic Plaques","Amyloid Deposition","Senile Plaques","Cell Abundance","Cohort Data","Cells In Microenvironment","Sample Cohort","Abundant Type","Synovial Sarcoma","Abundance Of Different Types","Actual Image","Combination Of Cell Types","Cold Areas","Hot Areas","Neutral Response","Cell Type Labels","Cell-type Labels","Number Of Cell Types","Visual Detection"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3028946","title":"A Visualization Interface to Improve the Transparency of Collected Personal Data on the Internet","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":80,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer IGD, Darmstadt, TU, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086832096","id":37086832096,"full_name":"Marija Schufrin","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer IGD, Darmstadt, TU, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer IGD, Darmstadt, TU, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656455","id":37088656455,"full_name":"Steven Lamarr Reynolds","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer IGD, Darmstadt, TU, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer IGD, Darmstadt, TU, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37270495600","id":37270495600,"full_name":"Arjan Kuijper","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer IGD, Darmstadt, TU, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer IGD, Darmstadt, TU, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37449689200","id":37449689200,"full_name":"Jorn Kohlhammer","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer IGD, Darmstadt, TU, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Online services are used for all kinds of activities, like news, entertainment, publishing content or connecting with others.

For multivariate graphs, a remaining challenge is to cope with the attributes that are associated with nodes and edges. Addressing this challenge, we propose responsive matrix cells as a focus+context approach for embedding additional interactive views into a matrix. Responsive matrix cells are local zoomable regions of interest that provide auxiliary data exploration and editing facilities for multivariate graphs. They behave responsively by adapting their visual contents to the cell location, the available display space, and the user task. Responsive matrix cells enable users to reveal details about the graph, compare node and edge attributes, and edit data values directly in a matrix without resorting to external views or tools. We report the general design considerations for responsive matrix cells covering the visual and interactive means necessary to support a seamless data exploration and editing. Responsive matrix cells have been implemented in a web-based prototype based on which we demonstrate the utility of our approach. We describe a walk-through for the use case of analyzing a graph of soccer players and report on insights from a preliminary user feedback session.","article_number":"9226461","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9226461","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9226461/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9226461/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1644","end_page":"1654","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1186,"insert_date":"20201016","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Task analysis","Layout","Lenses","Tools","Encoding"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Multivariate graph visualization","matrix visualization","focus+context","embedded visualizations","responsive visualization","graph editing"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive","Exploratory Data","User Feedback","Node Attributes","Nodal Properties","External Tools","Edge Attributes","Edge Properties","Aspect Ratio","Visual Representation","Miniature","Direct Use","Direct Utilization","Direct Manipulation","Number Of Objects","Bar Charts","Graph Structure","Place Cells","Place Field","Arrangement Of Cells","Matrix Representation","Part Of Matrix","Partial Matrices","Visibility Graph","Compact Size","Radar Chart","Radar Graph","Overview Of Structure","Attribute Values","Similar Nodes","Triangular Part","Individual Edges","Parallel Coordinates","Edit Operations","Local Adaptation","Individual Cells","Nodes In The Graph","Visual Encoding"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030358","title":"Once Upon A Time In Visualization: Understanding the Use of Textual Narratives for Causality","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":82,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech, Arlington, VA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085403900","id":37085403900,"full_name":"Arjun Choudhry","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virginia Tech, Arlington, VA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech, Arlington, VA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656681","id":37088656681,"full_name":"Mandar Sharma","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virginia Tech, Arlington, VA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656039","id":37088656039,"full_name":"Pramod Chundury","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Uncharted Software, Toronto, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37704437500","id":37704437500,"full_name":"Thomas Kapler","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Uncharted Software, Toronto, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"Uncharted Software, Toronto, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656506","id":37088656506,"full_name":"Derek W.

However, as the scale and complexity of these event sequences grows, even these visualizations can become overwhelming to use. In this paper, we propose the use of textual narratives as a data-driven storytelling method to augment causality visualization. We first propose a design space for how textual narratives can be used to describe causal data. We then present results from a crowdsourced user study where participants were asked to recover causality information from two causality visualizations-causal graphs and Hasse diagrams-with and without an associated textual narrative. Finally, we describe Causeworks, a causality visualization system for understanding how specific interventions influence a causal model. The system incorporates an automatic textual narrative mechanism based on our design space. We validate Causeworks through interviews with experts who used the system for understanding complex events.","article_number":"9222357","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222357","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222357/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222357/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1332","end_page":"1342","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":855,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Natural languages","Pipelines","Task analysis","Correlation","Tools"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Causality visualization","natural language generation","data-driven storytelling","temporal data","quantitative studies"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Narrative Text","Use Of Narratives","Causal Effect","Cause-and-effect","Cause-effect","User Study","Design Space","Causal Model","Causal Information","Interactive","Natural Language","Causal Inference","Visual Representation","Directed Acyclic Graph","Markov Random Field","Verbose","Wordy","Verbiage","Target Node","Minutes In Duration","Causal Network","Dynamic Graph","Text Generation","Sentence Generation","Natural Language Generation","Visual Channels","Causal System","Causal Graph","Form Of Storytelling"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030429","title":"Revealing Perceptual Proxies with Adversarial Examples","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":83,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, USA and University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086545518","id":37086545518,"full_name":"Brian D.

Clearly, the visual system does not compute these values as a computer would, as an arithmetic mean or a correlation. Instead, it extracts these patterns using perceptual proxies; heuristic shortcuts of the visual marks, such as a center of mass or a shape envelope. Understanding which proxies people use would lead to more effective visualizations. We present the results of a series of crowdsourced experiments that measure how powerfully a set of candidate proxies can explain human performance when comparing the mean and range of pairs of data series presented as bar charts. We generated datasets where the correct answer-the series with the larger arithmetic mean or range-was pitted against an “adversarial” series that should be seen as larger if the viewer uses a particular candidate proxy. We used both Bayesian logistic regression models and a robust Bayesian mixed-effects linear model to measure how strongly each adversarial proxy could drive viewers to answer incorrectly and whether different individuals may use different proxies. Finally, we attempt to construct adversarial datasets from scratch, using an iterative crowdsourcing procedure to perform black-box optimization.","article_number":"9238508","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9238508","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9238508/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9238508/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1073","end_page":"1083","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":592,"insert_date":"20201023","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Data visualization","Task analysis","Bars","Visual systems","Data mining","Bayes methods"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Perceptual proxies","vision science","crowdsourced evaluation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Adversarial Examples","Center Of Mass","Center-of-mass","Center Of Gravity","Data Visualization","Visual System","Arithmetic Mean","Crowdsourcing","Bar Charts","Bayesian Regression","Bayesian Ridge Regression","Bayesian Linear Regression","Black-box Optimization","Student’s T","Control Condition","Large Range","Posterior Probability","Posterior Distribution","Centroid","Visual Representation","Visual Comparison","Simulated Annealing","Random Data","Task Participants","Titer Values","Slope Range","Theory-driven Approach","Correlation Scatter Plots","Correlation Scatterplots","Vision Science","Pairwise Rank","Threshold Concepts","Staircase Method","Staircase Methods","Valid Trials","Validation Trials","Black-box Function"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030399","title":"Zoomless Maps: External Labeling Methods for the Interactive Exploration of Dense Point Sets at a Fixed Map Scale","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":84,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Geoinformation Group, Institute of Geodesy and Geoinformation, University of Bonn","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656669","id":37088656669,"full_name":"Sven Gedicke","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Geoinformation Group, Institute of Geodesy and Geoinformation, University of Bonn"]}},{"affiliation":"Geoinformation Group, Institute of Geodesy and Geoinformation, University of Bonn","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655667","id":37088655667,"full_name":"Annika Bonerath","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Geoinformation Group, Institute of Geodesy and Geoinformation, University of Bonn"]}},{"affiliation":"Geoinformation Group, Institute of Geodesy and Geoinformation, University of Bonn","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086195380","id":37086195380,"full_name":"Benjamin Niedermann","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Geoinformation Group, Institute of Geodesy and Geoinformation, University of Bonn"]}},{"affiliation":"Geoinformation Group, Institute of Geodesy and Geoinformation, University of Bonn","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017278900","id":38017278900,"full_name":"Jan-Henrik Haunert","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Geoinformation Group, Institute of Geodesy and Geoinformation, University of Bonn"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Visualizing spatial data on small-screen devices such as smartphones and smartwatches poses new challenges in computational cartography. The current interfaces for map exploration require their users to zoom in and out frequently. Indeed, zooming and panning are tools suitable for choosing the map extent corresponding to an area of interest. They are not as suitable, however, for resolving the graphical clutter caused by a high feature density since zooming in to a large map scale leads to a loss of context. Therefore, in this paper, we present new external labeling methods that allow a user to navigate through dense sets of points of interest while keeping the current map extent fixed. We provide a unified model, in which labels are placed at the boundary of the map and visually associated with the corresponding features via connecting lines, which are called leaders. Since the screen space is limited, labeling all features at the same time is impractical. Therefore, at any time, we label a subset of the features. We offer interaction techniques to change the current selection of features systematically and, thus, give the user access to all features. We distinguish three methods, which allow the user either to slide the labels along the bottom side of the map or to browse the labels based on pages or stacks. We present a generic algorithmic framework that provides us with the possibility of expressing the different variants of interaction techniques as optimization problems in a unified way. We propose both exact algorithms and fast and simple heuristics that solve the optimization problems taking into account different criteria such as the ranking of the labels, the total leader length as well as the distance between leaders. In experiments on real-world data we evaluate these algorithms and discuss the three variants with respect to their strengths and weaknesses proving the flexibility of the presented algorithmic framework.","article_number":"9222088","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222088","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222088/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222088/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1247","end_page":"1256","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":400,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Labeling","Optimization","Stacking","Navigation","Task analysis","Smart phones","Tools"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["external labeling","interactive maps","map exploration","small screens","algorithms","optimization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive","Labeling Method","Labeling Methods","Dense Set","Dense Subset","Natural Density","Optimization Problem","Exact Algorithm","Algorithmic Framework","Interaction Techniques","Simple Heuristics","Restaurants","Restorative","Cost Function","Relative Cost","Perfect Match","Feature Points","Characteristic Points","Vertical Distance","Sequence Of States","Number Of Labels","Technical Point Of View","Hard Constraints","Label Distribution","Star Rating","Star-rating","Integer Linear Programming Formulation","Cost Distance","Horizontal Segment","Exact Approach","Labels In Order","Multiple Pages","Optimal Labeling","Neighbour Solution","Neighbor Solution","Neighborhood Solutions","Neighbourhood Of Solution","Optimization Criteria","Optimization Criterion","Digital Map"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030333","title":"Interactive Visualization of Atmospheric Effects for Celestial Bodies","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":85,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102777","id":37087102777,"full_name":"Jonathas Costa","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University"]}},{"affiliation":"Linköping University, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489536800","id":38489536800,"full_name":"Alexander Bock","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Linköping University, University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"American Museum of Natural History","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085747250","id":37085747250,"full_name":"Carter Emmart","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["American Museum of Natural History"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266777200","id":37266777200,"full_name":"Charles Hansen","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"Linköping University, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284192000","id":37284192000,"full_name":"Anders Ynnerman","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Linköping University, University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275249200","id":37275249200,"full_name":"Cláudio Silva","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present an atmospheric model tailored for the interactive visualization of planetary surfaces. As the exploration of the solar system is progressing with increasingly accurate missions and instruments, the faithful visualization of planetary environments is gaining increasing interest in space research, mission planning, and science communication and education. Atmospheric effects are crucial in data analysis and to provide contextual information for planetary data. Our model correctly accounts for the non-linear path of the light inside the atmosphere (in Earth's case), the light absorption effects by molecules and dust particles, such as the ozone layer and the Martian dust, and a wavelength-dependent phase function for Mie scattering. The mode focuses on interactivity, versatility, and customization, and a comprehensive set of interactive controls make it possible to adapt its appearance dynamically. We demonstrate our results using Earth and Mars as examples. However, it can be readily adapted for the exploration of other atmospheres found on, for example, of exoplanets. For Earth's atmosphere, we visually compare our results with pictures taken from the International Space Station and against the CIE clear sky model. The Martian atmosphere is reproduced based on available scientific data, feedback from domain experts, and is compared to images taken by the Curiosity rover. The work presented here has been implemented in the OpenSpace system, which enables interactive parameter setting and real-time feedback visualization targeting presentations in a wide range of environments, from immersive dome theaters to virtual reality headsets.","article_number":"9222377","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222377","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222377/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222377/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"785","end_page":"795","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":592,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Atmospheric modeling","Data visualization","Terrestrial atmosphere","Scattering","Atmospheric measurements","Real-time systems"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Physical & Environmental Sciences","Engineering","Mathematics","Computer Graphics Techniques"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive Visualization","Atmospheric Effects","Atmospheric Events","Scientific Community","Light Absorption","Size Parameters","Mie Theory","Domain Experts","Atmospheric Model","Absorption Effects","Dust Particles","Phase Function","Space Research","Earth’s Atmosphere","Earth Atmosphere","Ozone Layer","Stratospheric Ozone","International Space Station","Planetary Surface","Exoplanets","Martian Atmosphere","Mars Atmosphere","Small Particles","Large Particles","Planetary Atmospheres","Standard Mode","Difference In Brightness","Complex Refractive Index","Complex Refractive Indices","Particle Density","Top-of-atmosphere","Top Of Atmosphere","Boundary Of Space","Cosine Of The Angle","Light Position","Absorption Cross-section","Advanced Mode"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030393","title":"Exemplar-based Layout Fine-tuning for Node-link Diagrams","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":86,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086496425","id":37086496425,"full_name":"Jiacheng Pan","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37291847800","id":37291847800,"full_name":"Wei Chen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656384","id":37088656384,"full_name":"Xiaodong Zhao","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102451","id":37087102451,"full_name":"Shuyue Zhou","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101788","id":37087101788,"full_name":"Wei Zeng","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086420980","id":37086420980,"full_name":"Minfeng Zhu","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Ohio State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38107662400","id":38107662400,"full_name":"Jian Chen","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Ohio State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085458481","id":37085458481,"full_name":"Siwei Fu","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","id":37407308300,"full_name":"Yingcai Wu","author_order":9,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","Zhejiang Lab, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We design and evaluate a novel layout fine-tuning technique for node-link diagrams that facilitates exemplar-based adjustment of a group of substructures in batching mode.

Handling large numbers of small multiples imposes challenges on many analytic tasks like inspection, comparison, navigation, or annotation. To address these challenges, we developed a framework and implemented a library called PILlNG.JS for designing interactive piling interfaces. Based on the piling metaphor, such interfaces afford flexible organization, exploration, and comparison of large numbers of small multiples by interactively aggregating visual objects into piles. Based on a systematic analysis of previous work, we present a structured design space to guide the design of visual piling interfaces. To enable designers to efficiently build their own visual piling interfaces, PILlNG.JS provides a declarative interface to avoid having to write low-level code and implements common aspects of the design space. An accompanying GUI additionally supports the dynamic configuration of the piling interface. We demonstrate the expressiveness of PILlNG.JS with examples from machine learning, immunofluorescence microscopy, genomics, and public health.","article_number":"9216572","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9216572","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216572/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216572/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"358","end_page":"368","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":580,"insert_date":"20201007","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Organizations","Task analysis","Data visualization","Encoding","Libraries","Aggregates"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Information visualization","small multiples","interactive piling","visual aggregation","spatial organization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive","Machine Learning","Machine-learning","Analysis Tasks","Design Space","Gestures","Subset Of Data","Repeated Measurements","Browsing","Grid Cells","Property Values","Time Of Initiation","Regular Grid","Cartesian Grid","Grid Structure","Rectangular Grid","Types Of Media","Multiple Items","Group Of Items","Visual Design","Cluster Plots","Pages Of The Book","Visual Encoding","Sequential Group","Aggregation Techniques","JavaScript"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030402","title":"Extraction and Visualization of Poincare Map Topology for Spacecraft Trajectory Design","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":88,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Science at Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282575100","id":37282575100,"full_name":"Xavier Tricoche","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science at Purdue University"]}},{"affiliation":"Mission Design Engineer, JHU Applied Physics Lab","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655686","id":37088655686,"full_name":"Wayne Schlei","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Mission Design Engineer, JHU Applied Physics Lab"]}},{"affiliation":"Astronautics at Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655840","id":37088655840,"full_name":"Kathleen C.

We propose algorithmic solutions that address the specific challenges posed by the characterization of the topology in astrodynamics problems and allow for an effective visual analysis of the resulting information. This visualization framework is applied to the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP), where it reveals novel periodic orbits with their relevant invariant manifolds in a suitable format for interactive transfer selection.

Computational tools, such as dimensionality reduction (DR) and classification, are commonly used to efficiently process the multidimensional space of features. These underlying calculations often hinder interpretability of results and prevent experts from assessing the impact of individual molecular features on the resulting representations. To provide a solution for scrutinizing such complex data, we introduce ChemVA, an interactive application for the visual exploration of large molecular ensembles and their features. Our tool consists of multiple coordinated views: Hexagonal view, Detail view, 3D view, Table view, and a newly proposed Difference view designed for the comparison of DR projections. These views display DR projections combined with biological activity, selected molecular features, and confidence scores for each of these projections. This conjunction of views allows the user to drill down through the dataset and to efficiently select candidate compounds. Our approach was evaluated on two case studies of finding structurally similar ligands with similar binding affinity to a target protein, as well as on an external qualitative evaluation. The results suggest that our system allows effective visual inspection and comparison of different high-dimensional molecular representations. Furthermore, ChemVA assists in the identification of candidate compounds while providing information on the certainty behind different molecular representations.","article_number":"9222282","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222282","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222282/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222282/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"891","end_page":"901","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":571,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Tools","Compounds","Visualization","Two dimensional displays","Drugs","Three-dimensional displays","Chemicals"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Virtual screening","visual analysis","dimensionality reduction","coordinated views","cheminformatics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive","Virtual Screening","Chemical Similarity","Molecular Similarity","Structural Similarity","SSIM","Target Proteins","Molecular Characterization","Molecular Features","Hexagonal","Dimensional Space","Multidimensional Space","Dimensionality Reduction","Medicinal Chemistry","Medicinal Properties","Visual Comparison","Detailed View","External Evaluation","External Rate","Drug Discovery Process","Candidate Compounds","Large Ensemble","Visual Exploration","Molecular Representation","Model Parameters","Drug Design","Domain Experts","Chemical Space","Set Of Compounds","Number Of Compounds","External Experts","Visualization Tool","t-SNE Projection","Similar Compounds","Potential New Drug","D2 Receptor","Dopamine D2","DRD2","Dopamine D2 Receptor"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3028891","title":"A Structured Review of Data Management Technology for Interactive Visualization and Analysis","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":90,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086366223","id":37086366223,"full_name":"Leilani Battle","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of Arizona","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550809300","id":37550809300,"full_name":"Carlos Scheidegger","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Arizona"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In the last two decades, interactive visualization and analysis have become a central tool in data-driven decision making. Concurrently to the contributions in data visualization, research in data management has produced technology that directly benefits interactive analysis. Here, we contribute a systematic review of 30 years of work in this adjacent field, and highlight techniques and principles we believe to be underappreciated in visualization work. We structure our review along two axes. First, we use task taxonomies from the visualization literature to structure the space of interactions in usual systems. Second, we created a categorization of data management work that strikes a balance between specificity and generality. Concretely, we contribute a characterization of 131 research papers along these two axes. We find that five notions in data management venues fit interactive visualization systems well: materialized views, approximate query processing, user modeling and query prediction, muiti-query optimization, lineage techniques, and indexing techniques. In addition, we find a preponderance of work in materialized views and approximate query processing, most targeting a limited subset of the interaction tasks in the taxonomy we used. This suggests natural avenues of future research both in visualization and data management. Our categorization both changes how we visualization researchers design and build our systems, and highlights where future work is necessary.","article_number":"9217931","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9217931","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9217931/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9217931/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1128","end_page":"1138","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1319,"insert_date":"20201008","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Optimization","Encoding","Visual databases","Visualization","Task analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Management","Interaction Analysis","Interactive Visualization","Data Management Technologies","Data Visualization","Visual System","Vision Research","Indexing Techniques","Large Datasets","Large Data Sets","Optimal Strategy","Optimal Scheme","Types Of Interactions","User Data","Research Database","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Visualization Tool","Performance Benefits","Functional Benefits","Formal Theory","Mathematical Theory","Visual Working","Multiple Queries","Data Cube","Datacube","Interactive Data Visualization","Visual Encoding","Visual Design","Domain-specific Languages","Interaction Design","Future Interactions","Similar Queries"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030383","title":"II-20: Intelligent and pragmatic analytic categorization of image collections","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":91,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Czech Technical University, Prague","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085525587","id":37085525587,"full_name":"Jan Zahálka","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Czech Technical University, Prague"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Amsterdam","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267865600","id":37267865600,"full_name":"Marcel Worring","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Amsterdam"]}},{"affiliation":"Eindhoven University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267249200","id":37267249200,"full_name":"Jarke J.

Advanced visualizations for image collections exist, but they need tight integration with a machine model to support the task of analytic categorization. Directly employing computer vision and interactive learning techniques gravitates towards search. Analytic categorization, however, is not machine classification (the difference between the two is called the pragmatic gap): a human adds/redefines/deletes categories of relevance on the fly to build insight, whereas the machine classifier is rigid and non-adaptive. Analytic categorization that truly brings the user to insight requires a flexible machine model that allows dynamic sliding on the exploration-search axis, as well as semantic interactions: a human thinks about image data mostly in semantic terms. 11-20 brings three major contributions to multimedia analytics on image collections and towards closing the pragmatic gap. Firstly, a new machine model that closely follows the user's interactions and dynamically models her categories of relevance. II-20's machine model, in addition to matching and exceeding the state of the art's ability to produce relevant suggestions, allows the user to dynamically slide on the exploration-search axis without any additional input from her side. Secondly, the dynamic, 1-image-at-a-time Tetris metaphor that synergizes with the model. It allows a well-trained model to analyze the collection by itself with minimal interaction from the user and complements the classic grid metaphor. Thirdly, the fast-forward interaction, allowing the user to harness the model to quickly expand (“fast-forward”) the categories of relevance, expands the multimedia analytics semantic interaction dictionary. Automated experiments show that II-20's machine model outperforms the existing state of the art and also demonstrate the Tetris metaphor's analytic quality. User studies further confirm that II-20 is an intuitive, efficient, and effective multimedia analytics tool.","article_number":"9230430","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9230430","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9230430/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9230430/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"422","end_page":"431","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":385,"insert_date":"20201019","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Analytical models","Semantics","Pragmatics","Computational modeling","Task analysis","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Multimedia analytics","image data","analytic categorization","pragmatic gap"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Image Collection","State Of The Art","State-of-the-art","User Study","Multimedia","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Interactive Learning","Machine Model","Tight Integrity","Advanced Visualization","Large Datasets","Large Data Sets","Deep Neural Network","Active Learning","Metadata","Forensic","Time Interaction","Visual Analysis","Number Of Images","Precision And Recall","Nearest Neighbor Search","Nearest Neighbor Method","Nearest Neighbour Method","Top Image","Rapid Serial Visual Presentation","Relevant Images","Control Panel","Multimodal Learning","Multimodal Deep Learning","Relevant Feedback","Real Use Case","Visual Metaphors","Unseen Images","Late Fusion","Domain Experts"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030364","title":"Supporting the Problem-Solving Loop: Designing Highly Interactive Optimisation Systems","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":92,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Monash University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086255317","id":37086255317,"full_name":"Jie Liu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37326161000","id":37326161000,"full_name":"Tim Dwyer","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085891841","id":37085891841,"full_name":"Guido Tack","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077342300","id":37077342300,"full_name":"Samuel Gratzl","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37354163600","id":37354163600,"full_name":"Kim Marriott","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Efficient optimisation algorithms have become important tools for finding high-quality solutions to hard, real-world problems such as production scheduling, timetabling, or vehicle routing. These algorithms are typically “black boxes” that work on mathematical models of the problem to solve. However, many problems are difficult to fully specify, and require a “human in the loop” who collaborates with the algorithm by refining the model and guiding the search to produce acceptable solutions. Recently, the Problem-Solving Loop was introduced as a high-level model of such interactive optimisation. Here, we present and evaluate nine recommendations for the design of interactive visualisation tools supporting the Problem-Solving Loop. They range from the choice of visual representation for solutions and constraints to the use of a solution gallery to support exploration of alternate solutions. We first examined the applicability of the recommendations by investigating how well they had been supported in previous interactive optimisation tools. We then evaluated the recommendations in the context of the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW). To do so we built a sophisticated interactive visual system for solving VRPTW that was informed by the recommendations. Ten participants then used this system to solve a variety of routing problems. We report on participant comments and interaction patterns with the tool. These showed the tool was regarded as highly usable and the results generally supported the usefulness of the underlying recommendations.","article_number":"9241744","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9241744","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9241744/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9241744/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1764","end_page":"1774","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":646,"insert_date":"20201028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Optimization","Tools","Task analysis","Mathematical model","Problem-solving","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Interactive optimisation","Interface design","Usability","Interactive systems and tools","Vehicle routing"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Optimal System","Time Window","Black Box","Visual Representation","Interactive System","Real-world Problems","Interactive Tool","Interactive Visualization","Routing Problem","Vehicle Routing","Human-in-the-loop","Human In The Loop","Participant Comments","Use Of Tools","Optimal Model","User Study","Visual Analysis","Total Distance","Use Of Features","Use Of Characteristics","System Usability","Road Map","Street Map","Recommendations For Support","Optimization Solver","Service Period","Service Periods","Recommendations For Evaluation","Recommendation Rate","Trust In Systems","Multiple Solutions","Comparison Of Solutions","Constraint Satisfaction Problem","Constraint Solver","Total Travel Distance","User Control"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030454","title":"Objective Observer-Relative Flow Visualization in Curved Spaces for Unsteady 2D Geophysical Flows","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":93,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Visual Computing Center, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37828701300","id":37828701300,"full_name":"Peter Rautek","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Computing Center, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia"]}},{"affiliation":"Visual Computing Center, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086545548","id":37086545548,"full_name":"Matej Mlejnek","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Computing Center, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37409575800","id":37409575800,"full_name":"Johanna Beyer","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Visual Computing Center, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656277","id":37088656277,"full_name":"Jakob Troidl","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Computing Center, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275698100","id":37275698100,"full_name":"Hanspeter Pfister","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Core Labs, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Saudi Arabia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655546","id":37088655546,"full_name":"Thomas Theußl","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Core Labs, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"]}},{"affiliation":"Visual Computing Center, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37394809600","id":37394809600,"full_name":"Markus Hadwiger","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Computing Center, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Computing and visualizing features in fluid flow often depends on the observer, or reference frame, relative to which the input velocity field is given. A desired property of feature detectors is therefore that they are objective, meaning independent of the input reference frame. However, the standard definition of objectivity is only given for Euclidean domains and cannot be applied in curved spaces. We build on methods from mathematical physics and Riemannian geometry to generalize objectivity to curved spaces, using the powerful notion of symmetry groups as the basis for definition. From this, we develop a general mathematical framework for the objective computation of observer fields for curved spaces, relative to which other computed measures become objective. An important property of our framework is that it works intrinsically in 2D, instead of in the 3D ambient space. This enables a direct generalization of the 2D computation via optimization of observer fields in flat space to curved domains, without having to perform optimization in 3D. We specifically develop the case of unsteady 2D geophysical flows given on spheres, such as the Earth. Our observer fields in curved spaces then enable objective feature computation as well as the visualization of the time evolution of scalar and vector fields, such that the automatically computed reference frames follow moving structures like vortices in a way that makes them appear to be steady.","article_number":"9222512","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222512","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222512/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222512/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"283","end_page":"293","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":619,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Observers","Visualization","Two dimensional displays","Three-dimensional displays","Manifolds","Hurricanes","Earth"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Flow visualization","observer fields","frames of reference","objectivity","symmetry groups","intrinsic covariant derivatives"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Curved Space","Flow Visualization","Geophysical Flows","Flow Velocity","Flow Speed","Velocity Field","Reference Frame","Vector Field","Symmetry Group","Molecular Symmetry","Point Group Symmetry","Riemannian Manifold","Riemannian Space","Riemannian Geometry","Mathematical Physics","Flat Space","Ambient Space","Manifold","Global Optimization","Hurricane","Tropical Cyclones","3D Space","3-dimensional Space","Flow Characteristics","Flow Features","Linear Form","Euclidean Space","Earth Surface","Earth's Surface","Lie Group","Covariant Derivative","Pathlines","Lie Derivative","Lie Algebra","Tangent Space","Christoffel Symbols","Christoffel Connection","Arbitrary Vector","3D Computer","3D Calculations","Least Squares Problem"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030470","title":"Ray Tracing Structured AMR Data Using ExaBricks","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":94,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"NVIDIA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282958300","id":37282958300,"full_name":"Ingo Wald","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["NVIDIA"]}},{"affiliation":"NVIDIA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087079401","id":37087079401,"full_name":"Stefan Zellmann","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["NVIDIA"]}},{"affiliation":"NVIDIA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085735276","id":37085735276,"full_name":"Will Usher","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["NVIDIA"]}},{"affiliation":"NVIDIA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087129005","id":37087129005,"full_name":"Nate Morrical","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["NVIDIA"]}},{"affiliation":"NVIDIA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681696700","id":37681696700,"full_name":"Ulrich Lang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["NVIDIA"]}},{"affiliation":"NVIDIA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284312600","id":37284312600,"full_name":"Valerio Pascucci","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["NVIDIA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Structured Adaptive Mesh Refinement (Structured AMR) enables simulations to adapt the domain resolution to save computation and storage, and has become one of the dominant data representations used by scientific simulations; however, efficiently rendering such data remains a challenge.

An effective grid map is coherent with the underlying geographic space: the tiles maintain the contiguity, neighborhoods and identifiability of the corresponding spatial elements, while the grid map as a whole maintains the global shape of the input. Of particular importance are salient local features of the global shape which need to be represented by tiles assigned to the appropriate spatial elements. State-of-the-art techniques can adequately deal only with simple cases, such as close-to-uniform spatial distributions or global shapes that have few characteristic features. We introduce a simple fully-automated 3-step pipeline for computing coherent grid maps. Each step is a well-studied problem: shape decomposition based on salient features, tile-based Mosaic Cartograms, and point-set matching. Our pipeline is a seamless composition of existing techniques for these problems and results in high-quality grid maps.

More specifically, it is often valuable to understand which ranges of which input variables lead to particular values of a given target variable. Unfortunately, with an increasing number of independent variables, this process may become cumbersome and time-consuming due to the many possible combinations that have to be explored. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to visualize correlations between input variables and a target output variable that scales to hundreds of variables. We developed a visual model based on neural networks that can be explored in a guided way to help analysts find and understand such correlations. First, we train a neural network to predict the target from the input variables. Then, we visualize the inner workings of the resulting model to help understand relations within the data set. We further introduce a new regularization term for the backpropagation algorithm that encourages the neural network to learn representations that are easier to interpret visually.

In SineStream, we connect the readability of streamgraphs with minimizing sine illusions and by doing so provide a perceptual foundation for their design. As the geometry of a streamgraph is controlled by its baseline (the bottom-most curve) and the ordering of the layers, we re-interpret baseline computation and layer ordering algorithms in terms of reducing sine illusion effects. For baseline computation, we improve previous methods by introducing a Gaussian weight to penalize layers with large thickness changes. For layer ordering, three design requirements are proposed and implemented through a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Quantitative experiments and user studies demonstrate that SineStream improves the readability and aesthetics of streamgraphs compared to state-of-the-art methods.","article_number":"9222035","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222035","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222035/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222035/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1634","end_page":"1643","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":497,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Distortion","Optimization","Task analysis","Visualization","Distortion measurement","Clustering algorithms","Motion pictures"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Streamgraphs","Sine Illusion","Readability"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Readability","Illusion Effect","Hierarchical Clustering","Hierarchical Cluster Analysis","User Study","Changes In Thickness","Vertical Distance","Large Thickness","Layer In Order","Gaussian Weighting","Distortion","Thin Layer","Layer Thickness","Slope Of Curve","Time Complexity","Completion Time","Start Time","Question Answering","Question-answering","Real-world Datasets","Real-world Data Sets","Adjacent Layers","Weights Of Layer","Length Of Layer","Pairs Of Layers","Neighboring Layers","Number Of Time Points","Number Of Timepoints","Individual Layers","Baseline Algorithms","Iterative Refinement","Green Layer","Sudden Jumps","Formal Analysis"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3028892","title":"A Visualization Framework for Multi-scale Coherent Structures in Taylor-Couette Turbulence","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":101,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Houston","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087128206","id":37087128206,"full_name":"Duong B.

It has been heavily researched in fluid mechanics thanks to the various nonlinear dynamical phenomena that are exhibited in the flow. As many dense coherent structures overlap each other in TCF, it is challenging to isolate and visualize them, especially when the cylinder rotation ratio is changing. Previous approaches rely on 2D cross sections to study TCF due to its simplicity, which cannot provide the complete information of TCF. In the meantime, standard visualization techniques, such as volume rendering / iso-surfacing of certain attributes and the placement of integral curves/surfaces, usually produce cluttered visualization. To address this challenge and to support domain experts in the analysis of TCF, we developed a visualization framework to separate large-scale structures from the dense, small-scale structures and provide an effective visual representation of these structures. Instead of using a single physical attribute as the standard approach which cannot efficiently separate structures in different scales for TCF, we adapt the feature level-set method to combine multiple attributes and use them as a filter to separate large- and small-scale structures. To visualize these structures, we apply the iso-surface extraction on the kernel density estimate of the distance field generated from the feature level-set. The proposed methods successfully reveal 3D large-scale coherent structures of TCF with different control parameter settings, which are difficult to achieve with the conventional methods.","article_number":"9216538","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9216538","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216538/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216538/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"902","end_page":"912","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":435,"insert_date":"20201007","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Two dimensional displays","Feature extraction","Periodic structures","Standards","Rendering (computer graphics)"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Flow visualization","Taylor-Couette turbulence","coherent structures"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Multi-scale Structure","Visual Framework","Physical Properties","Multiple Dimensions","Multiple Attributes","Multiple Properties","Density Estimation","Domain Experts","Distance Map","Distance Transform","Distance Field","Large-scale Structures","Large Scale Structure","Separate Structures","Fluid Mechanics","2D Cross-section","Flow Velocity","Flow Speed","Velocity Field","Large Structures","Grid Points","Reynolds Number","Distance Values","Characteristic Scale","Scale Features","Turbulent Flow","Vector Field","Scale Structure","Small-scale Features","Smaller-scale Features","Small Scale Features","Streamwise Direction","Streamwise Velocity","Large-scale Features","Large-scale Characteristics","Large Scale Features","Cylindrical Coordinates","Spanwise Direction","2D Visualization","Density Field","Small Vortices","Small Vortex","3D Visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030422","title":"Truth or Square: Aspect Ratio Biases Recall of Position Encodings","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":102,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Northwestern University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087099982","id":37087099982,"full_name":"Cristina R.

Yet reproductions of single bars or groups of bars within a graph can be biased. Curiously, some previous work found that this bias resulted in an overestimation of reproduced data values, while other work found an underestimation. Across three empirical studies, we offer an explanation for these conflicting findings: this discrepancy is a consequence of the differing aspect ratios of the tested bar marks. Viewers are biased to remember a bar mark as being more similar to a prototypical square, leading to an overestimation of bars with a wide aspect ratio, and an underestimation of bars with a tall aspect ratio. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that the aspect ratio of the bar marks indeed influenced the direction of this bias. Experiment 3 confirmed that this pattern of misestimation bias was present for reproductions from memory, suggesting that this bias may arise when comparing values across sequential displays or views. We describe additional visualization designs that might be prone to this bias beyond bar charts (e.g., Mekko charts and treemaps), and speculate that other visual channels might hold similar biases toward prototypical values.","article_number":"9222047","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222047","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222047/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222047/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1054","end_page":"1062","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":432,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Bars","Image color analysis","Encoding","Visualization","Data visualization","Estimation","Prototypes"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Memory biases","position estimation","bar charts","aspect ratio","area"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Aspect Ratio","Positional Encoding","Prototype","Bar Charts","Directional Bias","Treemap","Tree Map","Functional Tree","Performance Of Trees","Pattern Of Bias","Biased Patterns","Single Bar","Linear Model","Linear Regression Model","Hierarchical Regression","Multilevel Analysis","Multilevel Models","Hierarchical Multiple Regression","Linear Mixed-effects Models","Linear Mixed Effects Models","Positive Bias","Positive Consequences","Positive Events","Response Bias","Response Biases","Fixed Effects","Response Accuracy","Vertical Position","Vertical Location","Average Position","Average Location","Position Estimation","Attitude Estimation","Degree Of Bias","Response Error","Effect Of Aspect Ratio","Bar Height","Height Of Each Bar","Slope Data","Bias Trends","Biased Trend","Color Wheel","Colour Wheel","Color Patches","Colour Patches","Direct Perception","Fixed Factor","Difference In Accuracy","Bar Width","Bar Widths"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030446","title":"The Effectiveness of Interactive Visualization Techniques for Time Navigation of Dynamic Graphs on Large Displays","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":103,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Dept. of Computer Science, Swansea University, Swansea University Medical School, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655776","id":37088655776,"full_name":"Alexandra Lee","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, Swansea University, Swansea University Medical School, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Dept. of Computer Science, Swansea University, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396011500","id":37396011500,"full_name":"Daniel Archambault","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, Swansea University, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Dept. of Computer Science, University of Victoria, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086329318","id":37086329318,"full_name":"Miguel A.

Although it is straightforward to provide interfaces for visualization that represent multiple states of the network (i.e., multiple timeslices) either simultaneously (e.g., through small multiples) or interactively (e.g., through interactive animation), these interfaces might not support tasks in which disjoint timeslices need to be compared. Since these tasks are key for understanding the dynamic aspects of the network, understanding which interactive visualizations best support these tasks is important. We present the results of a series of laboratory experiments comparing two traditional approaches (small multiples and interactive animation), with a more recent approach based on interactive timeslicing. The tasks were performed on a large display through a touch interface. Participants completed 24 trials of three tasks with all techniques. The results show that interactive timeslicing brings benefit when comparing distant points in time, but less benefits when analyzing contiguous intervals of time.","article_number":"9222301","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222301","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222301/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222301/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"528","end_page":"538","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":645,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Animation","Data visualization","Navigation","Task analysis","Microsoft Windows","Visualization","Computer science"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Dynamic networks","Information visualization","Large displays"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Navigation","Visualization Techniques","Dynamic Graph","Interactive Visualization Techniques","Time Interval","Series Of Experiments","Time Range","Dynamic Network","Point Distance","Time Window","Percentage Points","Kinetic Data","Dynamic Data","Completion Time","Types Of Tasks","Graph Structure","Statistical Methodology","Additional Tasks","Common Examples","Selected Time Window","Graph Layout","Graph Drawing","4K Resolution","4K UHD","4K Camera","Collaborative Setting","Holm-Bonferroni Correction","Bonferroni-Holm Correction","Temporal Localization","Temporal Position","Dynamic Visualization","Discrete Time Points","Visibility Graph","Time Distance"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030385","title":"Staged Animation Strategies for Online Dynamic Networks","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":104,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37597152500","id":37597152500,"full_name":"Tarik Crnovrsanin","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100249","id":37087100249,"full_name":"Shilpika","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086388430","id":37086388430,"full_name":"Senthil Chandrasegaran","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275869400","id":37275869400,"full_name":"Kwan-Liu Ma","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Dynamic networks-networks that change over time-can be categorized into two types: offline dynamic networks, where all states of the network are known, and online dynamic networks, where only the past states of the network are known. Research on staging animated transitions in dynamic networks has focused more on offline data, where rendering strategies can take into account past and future states of the network. Rendering online dynamic networks is a more challenging problem since it requires a balance between timeliness for monitoring tasks-so that the animations do not lag too far behind the events-and clarity for comprehension tasks-to minimize simultaneous changes that may be difficult to follow. To illustrate the challenges placed by these requirements, we explore three strategies to stage animations for online dynamic networks: time-based, event-based, and a new hybrid approach that we introduce by combining the advantages of the first two. We illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy in representing low- and high-throughput data and conduct a user study involving monitoring and comprehension of dynamic networks. We also conduct a follow-up, think-aloud study combining monitoring and comprehension with experts in dynamic network visualization. Our findings show that animation staging strategies that emphasize comprehension do better for participant response times and accuracy. However, the notion of “comprehension” is not always clear when it comes to complex changes in highly dynamic networks, requiring some iteration in staging that the hybrid approach affords. Based on our results, we make recommendations for balancing event-based and time-based parameters for our hybrid approach.","article_number":"9231268","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9231268","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9231268/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9231268/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"539","end_page":"549","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":531,"insert_date":"20201019","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Animation","Layout","Dynamics","Monitoring","Visualization","Real-time systems","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Dynamic networks","graph visualization","animation","mental map","user study"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Dynamic Network","Response Time","User Study","Visual Network","Network Diagram","Hybrid Approach","Network State","Network Conditions","Network Status","Dynamic Visualization","Response Times Of Participants","Response Times For Each Participant","Disadvantages Of Strategies","Disadvantages Of Each Strategy","Follow-up Study","Time Step","Data Rate","Data Evaluation","Volume Of Data","Intensity Data","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Network Changes","State Representation","Task In Study","Edge Length","Edge Lengths","Node Positions","Location Of Nodes","Time Slice","Monitoring Task","Dynamic Graph","Comprehension Task","NASA Task Load Index","NASA-Task Load Index","Mental Maps","Graph Layout","Graph Drawing","Mental Load","Physical Load","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Video Playback"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030365","title":"Modeling the Influence of Visual Density on Cluster Perception in Scatterplots Using Topology","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":105,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of South Florida","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086556695","id":37086556695,"full_name":"Ghulam Jilani Quadri","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of South Florida"]}},{"affiliation":"University of South Florida","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37398611400","id":37398611400,"full_name":"Paul Rosen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of South Florida"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Scatterplots are used for a variety of visual analytics tasks, including cluster identification, and the visual encodings used on a scatterplot play a deciding role on the level of visual separation of clusters. For visualization designers, optimizing the visual encodings is crucial to maximizing the clarity of data. This requires accurately modeling human perception of cluster separation, which remains challenging. We present a multi-stage user study focusing on four factors-distribution size of clusters, number of points, size of points, and opacity of points-that influence cluster identification in scatterplots. From these parameters, we have constructed two models, a distance-based model, and a density-based model, using the merge tree data structure from Topological Data Analysis. Our analysis demonstrates that these factors play an important role in the number of clusters perceived, and it verifies that the distance-based and density-based models can reasonably estimate the number of clusters a user observes. Finally, we demonstrate how these models can be used to optimize visual encodings on real-world data.","article_number":"9222295","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222295","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222295/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222295/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1829","end_page":"1839","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":635,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Task analysis","Data models","Encoding","Data visualization","Analytical models","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Scatterplot","clustering","perception","empirical evaluation","visual encoding","crowdsourcing","topological data analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["User Study","Visual Design","Point Size","Merging Algorithm","Merge Tree","Visual Encoding","Distance-based Model","Topological Data Analysis","Linear Regression","Interaction Effect","Real-valued","Least Squares Regression","Linear Least Squares","Input Parameters","Data Generation","Relative Density","Specific Gravity","Data Clustering","Number Of Data Points","Cluster Centers","Distribution Of Points","User Responses","Density Histogram","Repeated Measures ANOVA Test","Repeated-measures ANOVA Test","Distribution Of Data Points"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030376","title":"Insight Beyond Numbers: The Impact of Qualitative Factors on Visual Data Analysis","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":106,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Federal Criminal Police Office, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086476607","id":37086476607,"full_name":"Benjamin Karer","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Federal Criminal Police Office, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Kaiserslautern","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282578800","id":37282578800,"full_name":"Hans Hagen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Kaiserslautern"]}},{"affiliation":"Ostfalia University of Applied Sciences","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601992200","id":37601992200,"full_name":"Dirk J.

Contemporary visualization as a field of research shows a strong tendency to adopt this data-centrism. Despite their decisive influence on the analysis result, qualitative aspects of the analysis process such as the structure, soundness, and complexity of the applied reasoning strategy are rarely discussed explicitly. We argue that if the purpose of visualization is the provision of domain insight rather than the depiction of data analysis results, a holistic perspective requires a qualitative component to to be added to the discussion of quantitative and human factors. To support this point, we demonstrate how considerations of qualitative factors in visual analysis can be applied to obtain explanations and possible solutions for a number of practical limitations inherent to the data-centric perspective on analysis. Based on this discussion of what we call qualitative visual analysis, we develop an inside-outside principle of nested levels of context that can serve as a conceptual basis for the development of visualization systems that optimally support the emergence of insight during analysis.","article_number":"9241426","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9241426","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9241426/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9241426/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1011","end_page":"1021","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":834,"insert_date":"20201027","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Cognition","Data analysis","Task analysis","Computer architecture","Analytical models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Reasoning","Qualitative Aspects"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Visualization","Visual Analysis","Visual Analysis Of Data","Qualitative Analysis","Qualitative Data Analysis","Visualization Purposes","Discussion Of Factors","Discussion Of These Factors","Distancing Measures","Cognitive Domains","Domain Knowledge","Conceptual Model","Systematic Errors","Patterns In Data","Automatic Analyzer","User Study","Quantitative Information","Partial Data","Analysis Tasks","Properties Of Data","Data Attributes","Domain Experts","Data Analysis Process","US Context","Vision Applications","Kind Of Insight","Visual Design","Knowledge Users","Qualitative Properties","Qualitative Attributes","Qualitative Dimensions","Application In Order","Mental Models","Visual Literacy","Common Practice","Domain Features","Characteristic Domain"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030407","title":"Polyphorm: Structural Analysis of Cosmological Datasets via Interactive Physarum Polycephalum Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":107,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Dept. of Computational Media, University of California, Santa Cruz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38667473900","id":38667473900,"full_name":"Oskar Elek","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Dept. of Computational Media, University of California, Santa Cruz"]}},{"affiliation":"Dept. of Astronomy and Astrophysics, University of California, Santa Cruz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655628","id":37088655628,"full_name":"Joseph N.

Researchers can interactively update the simulation by adjusting model parameters, and then investigate the resulting visual output to form hypotheses about the data.

This type of retrospective visual analysis, however, is prone to a variety of selection bias effects, especially for high-dimensional data where only a subset of dimensions is visualized at any given time. The risk of selection bias is even higher when analysts dynamically apply filters or perform grouping operations during ad hoc analyses. These bias effects threaten the validity and generalizability of insights discovered during visual analysis as the basis for decision making. Past work has focused on bias transparency, helping users understand when selection bias may have occurred. However, countering the effects of selection bias via bias mitigation is typically left for the user to accomplish as a separate process. Dynamic reweighting (DR) is a novel computational approach to selection bias mitigation that helps users craft bias-corrected visualizations. This paper describes the DR workflow, introduces key DR visualization designs, and presents statistical methods that support the DR process. Use cases from the medical domain, as well as findings from domain expert user interviews, are also reported.","article_number":"9233264","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9233264","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9233264/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9233264/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1481","end_page":"1491","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":520,"insert_date":"20201020","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visual analytics","Tools","Interviews","Data collection","Medical diagnostic imaging"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Selection bias","bias mitigation","bias correction","high-dimensional visualization","cohort selection","medical informatics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Dynamic Reweighting","Selection Bias","Electronic Health Records","Electronic Medical Records","Visual Analysis","Domain Experts","Risk Of Selection Bias","Visual Design","Visual Analysis Of Data","Exploratory Analysis","Exploratory Data Analysis","Distancing Measures","Medical Data","Large Shift","Propensity Score Matching","Propensity Score-matched","Domain Shift","Shift In Distribution","Vector Field","Bias Correction","Cadence","Visualization Techniques","Interactive Visualization","Nicotine Dependence","Tobacco Dependence","Set Of Dimensions","Baseline Cohort","Combination Of Dimensions","Subgroup Size","Split-plot","Split-plot Design","Real-world Use Cases","Real World Use Cases","Hellinger Distance","Impact Of Correction","Color Map","Colour Map","Colormap","Semi-structured Interviews"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030400","title":"Revisited: Comparison of Empirical Methods to Evaluate Visualizations Supporting Crafting and Assembly Purposes","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":109,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088963281","id":37088963281,"full_name":"Maximilian Weiß","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088642160","id":37088642160,"full_name":"Katrin Angerbauer","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"SE, Dortmund","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656623","id":37088656623,"full_name":"Alexandra Voit","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SE, Dortmund"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088585674","id":37088585674,"full_name":"Magdalena Schwarzl","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590945600","id":37590945600,"full_name":"Michael Sedlmair","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Carnegie Mellon University, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656426","id":37088656426,"full_name":"Sven Mayer","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, United States"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Ubiquitous, situated, and physical visualizations create entirely new possibilities for tasks contextualized in the real world, such as doctors inserting needles. During the development of situated visualizations, evaluating visualizations is a core requirement. However, performing such evaluations is intrinsically hard as the real scenarios are safety-critical or expensive to test. To overcome these issues, researchers and practitioners adapt classical approaches from ubiquitous computing and use surrogate empirical methods such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) prototypes, or merely online demonstrations. This approach's primary assumption is that meaningful insights can also be gained from different, usually cheaper and less cumbersome empirical methods. Nevertheless, recent efforts in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community have found evidence against this assumption, which would impede the use of surrogate empirical methods. Currently, these insights rely on a single investigation of four interactive objects. The goal of this work is to investigate if these prior findings also hold for situated visualizations. Therefore, we first created a scenario where situated visualizations support users in do-it-yourself (DIY) tasks such as crafting and assembly. We then set up five empirical study methods to evaluate the four tasks using an online survey, as well as VR, AR, laboratory, and in-situ studies. Using this study design, we conducted a new study with 60 participants. Our results show that the situated visualizations we investigated in this study are not prone to the same dependency on the empirical method, as found in previous work. Our study provides the first evidence that analyzing situated visualizations through different empirical (surrogate) methods might lead to comparable results.","article_number":"9225008","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9225008","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9225008/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9225008/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1204","end_page":"1213","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":658,"insert_date":"20201015","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Task analysis","Data visualization","Fasteners","Human computer interaction","Needles","Tools"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Situated visualization","evaluation","comparison"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Empirical Methods","Empirical Method","Interactive","Online Survey","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Post Hoc Test","Post Hoc Analysis","Evaluation Method","Evaluation Methods","Rate Method","Laboratory Studies","Dislike","Non-significant Results","Analysis Effect Size","Attractant","Prior Results","Prior Outcomes","Word Count","High Ecological Validity","System Usability Scale","Position Feedback","Time Of Questionnaire Completion","Bayes Factor","Bayesian Model Selection"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030412","title":"Sea of Genes: A Reflection on Visualising Metagenomic Data for Museums","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":110,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"UC Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086925054","id":37086925054,"full_name":"Keshav Dasu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UC Davis"]}},{"affiliation":"UC Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275869400","id":37275869400,"full_name":"Kwan-Liu Ma","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UC Davis"]}},{"affiliation":"The Exploratorium","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489269900","id":38489269900,"full_name":"Joyce Ma","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The Exploratorium"]}},{"affiliation":"The Exploratorium","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233965200","id":38233965200,"full_name":"Jennifer Frazier","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The Exploratorium"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We examine the process of designing an exhibit to communicate scientific findings from a complex dataset and unfamiliar domain to the public in a science museum.

Yet, adoption of these techniques for data visualization is low partly because development is difficult: existing collaboration software systems either do not support simultaneous interaction or require expensive redevelopment of existing visualizations. We contribute VisConnect: a web-based synchronous distributed collaborative visualization system that supports most web-based SVG data visualizations, balances system safety with responsiveness, and supports simultaneous interaction from many collaborators. VisConnect works with existing visualization implementations with little-to-no code changes by synchronizing low-level JavaScript events across clients such that visualization updates proceed transparently across clients. This is accomplished via a peer-to-peer system that establishes consensus among clients on the per-element sequence of events, and uses a lock service to grant access over elements to clients. We contribute collaborative extensions of traditional visualization interaction techniques, such as drag, brush, and lasso, and discuss different strategies for collaborative visualization interactions. To demonstrate the utility of VisConnect, we present novel examples of collaborative visualizations in the healthcare domain, remote collaboration with annotation, and show in an education case study for e-learning with 22 participants that students found the ability to remotely collaborate on class activities helpful and enjoyable for understanding concepts.

This data structure allows us to compress, render, and query segmentation histograms. Such histograms arise when building a mipmap of a volume containing segmentation IDs. Each voxel in the histogram mipmap contains a convex combination (mixture) of segmentation IDs. Each mixture represents the distribution of IDs in the respective voxel's children. Our method factorizes these mixtures into a series of linear interpolations between exactly two segmentation IDs. The result is represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose nodes are topologically ordered. Pruning replicate nodes in the tree followed by compression allows us to store the resulting data structure efficiently. During rendering, transfer functions are propagated from sources (leafs) through the DAG to allow for efficient, pre-filtered rendering at interactive frame rates. Assembly of histogram contributions across the footprint of a given volume allows us to efficiently query partial histograms, achieving up to 178 x speed-up over naive parallelized range queries. Additionally, we apply the Mixture Graph to compute correctly pre-filtered volume lighting and to interactively explore segments based on shape, geometry, and orientation using multi-dimensional transfer functions.","article_number":"9224646","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9224646","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9224646/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9224646/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"645","end_page":"655","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":438,"insert_date":"20201015","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Histograms","Data structures","Semantics","Encoding","Transfer functions","Interpolation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Segmented Volumes","Data Structures","Sparse Data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Histogram","Data Structure","Factorization","Transfer Function","Parallelization","Parallel Computing","Linear Interpolation","Topological States","Topological Phase Transition","Topological Order","Topological Phase","Directed Acyclic Graph","Convex Combination","Range Query","Raw Data","Quantum","Codebook","List Of Codes","Objective Data","Error Propagation","Cumulative Error","Uncertainty Propagation","Lookup Table","Connectome","Lossless","Random Access","Nonzero Entries","Segmented Volume","Semantic Objects","Nominal Data","Vector Quantization","Input Segment","Raw Volume","Lossy Compression","Compression Method","Compression Methods","Identification Of Nodes","Node IDs","Sparse Coding"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030476","title":"StructGraphics: Flexible Visualization Design through Data-Agnostic and Reusable Graphical Structures","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":113,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Inria & CNRS, Université Paris-Saclay, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085357220","id":37085357220,"full_name":"Theophanis Tsandilas","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Inria & CNRS, Université Paris-Saclay, France"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Information visualization research has developed powerful systems that enable users to author custom data visualizations without textual programming. These systems can support graphics-driven practices by bridging lazy data-binding mechanisms with vector-graphics editing tools. Yet, despite their expressive power, visualization authoring systems often assume that users want to generate visual representations that they already have in mind rather than explore designs. They also impose a data-to-graphics workflow, where binding data dimensions to graphical properties is a necessary step for generating visualization layouts. In this paper, we introduce StructGraphics, an approach for creating data-agnostic and fully reusable visualization designs. StructGraphics enables designers to construct visualization designs by drawing graphics on a canvas and then structuring their visual properties without relying on a concrete dataset or data schema. In StructGraphics, tabular data structures are derived directly from the structure of the graphics. Later, designers can link these structures with real datasets through a spreadsheet user interface. StructGraphics supports the design and reuse of complex data visualizations by combining graphical property sharing, by-example design specification, and persistent layout constraints. We demonstrate the power of the approach through a gallery of visualization examples and reflect on its strengths and limitations in interaction with graphic designers and data visualization experts.","article_number":"9222091","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222091","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222091/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222091/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"315","end_page":"325","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":933,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Layout","Visualization","Tools","Programming","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization design","graphical structures","visualization grammars","layout constraints","infographics","flexible data binding"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Graph Structure","Flexible Design","Visual Design","Data Visualization","Spreadsheet","Visual Properties","Visual Attributes","Visibility Graph","Graphic Design","Graph Properties","Attributed Graph","Concrete Data","Critical Thinking","Critical Analysis","Critical Reflection","Critical Appraisal","Bar Charts","Infographic","Graphical Display","Analysis Tasks","Levels Of Hierarchy","Interactive Visualization","Design Work","Child Nodes","Children Nodes","Node Attributes","Nodal Properties","JavaScript Object Notation","Sankey Diagram","Sankey Plot","Collective Reflection","Equal Spacing","Copy And Paste","Copy-and-paste","Line Chart","Text Field","Geometric Primitives","Graphical Primitives","Design Workflow","Manual Data Entry"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3028956","title":"A Visual Analytics Approach for Ecosystem Dynamics based on Empirical Dynamic Modeling","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":114,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Kyoto University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38468551100","id":38468551100,"full_name":"Hiroaki Natsukawa","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Kyoto University"]}},{"affiliation":"Boston University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655987","id":37088655987,"full_name":"Ethan R.

In real systems, such as those found in ecology, the relationships between time series variables are generally not static; instead, these relationships are dynamical and change in a nonlinear or state-dependent manner. To further understand such systems, we investigate integrating methods that appropriately characterize these dynamics (i.e., methods that measure interactions as they change with time-varying system states) with visualization techniques that can help analyze the behavior of the system. Here, we focus on empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) as a state-of-the-art method that specifically identifies causal variables and measures changing state-dependent relationships between time series variables. Instead of using approaches centered on parametric equations, EDM is an equation-free approach that studies systems based on their dynamic attractors. We propose a visual analytics system to support the identification and mechanistic interpretation of system states using an EDM-constructed dynamic graph. This work, as detailed in four analysis tasks and demonstrated with a GUI, provides a novel synthesis of EDM and visualization techniques such as brush-link visualization and visual summarization to interpret dynamic graphs representing ecosystem dynamics. We applied our proposed system to ecological simulation data and real data from a marine mesocosm study as two key use cases. Our case studies show that our visual analytics tools support the identification and interpretation of the system state by the user, and enable us to discover both confirmatory and new findings in ecosystem dynamics. Overall, we demonstrated that our system can facilitate an understanding of how systems function beyond the intuitive analysis of high-dimensional information based on specific domain knowledge.","article_number":"9216532","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9216532","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216532/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216532/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"506","end_page":"516","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1010,"insert_date":"20201007","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Time series analysis","Data visualization","Ecosystems","Task analysis","Time measurement","Ecology"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","empirical dynamic modeling","dynamic network","exploratory data analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Empirical Model","Visual Analysis","Ecosystem Dynamics","Visual Analytics Approach","Empirical Dynamic Modeling","Time Series","Time-series","System State","Time Series Data","Time-series Data","Visual System","Graphical User Interface","Graphical Interface","Visualization Tool","Analysis Tasks","Visualization Techniques","Time Series Variables","Time-series Variation","Mesocosm","Identification Of States","Status Identification","Dynamic Graph","Interpretation Of States","Visual Analytics Tool","Interactive","Artificial Datasets","Artificial Data Sets","Dynamic Network","Real-world Datasets","Real-world Data Sets","Time Series Plots","Time-series Plots","Dimensionality Reduction","Interaction Strength","Interaction Strengths","Dimensionality Reduction Methods","Dimensionality Reduction Method","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Local Linear"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030386","title":"MultiSegVA: Using Visual Analytics to Segment Biologging Time Series on Multiple Scales","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":115,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088585538","id":37088585538,"full_name":"Philipp Meschenmoser","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233607000","id":38233607000,"full_name":"Juri F.

MultiSegVA primarily contributes tailored, visual-interactive means and visual analytics paradigms for segmenting unlabeled time series on multiple scales. Further, to flexibly compose the multi-scale segmentation, the platform contributes a new visual query language that links a variety of segmentation techniques. To illustrate our approach, we present a domain-oriented set of segmentation techniques derived in collaboration with movement ecologists. We demonstrate the applicability and usefulness of MultiSegVA in two real-world use cases from movement ecology, related to behavior analysis after environment-aware segmentation, and after progressive clustering. Expert feedback from movement ecologists shows the effectiveness of tailored visual-interactive means and visual analytics paradigms at segmenting multi-scale data, enabling them to perform semantically meaningful analyses.

Trial-and-error procedures have to be repeatedly conducted by such approaches. To resolve this issue, we propose a new perspective of ensemble data analysis using the attribute variable dimension as the primary analysis dimension. Particularly, we propose a variable uncertainty calculation method based on variable spatial spreading. Based on this method, we design an interactive ensemble analysis framework that provides a flexible interactive exploration of the ensemble data. Particularly, the proposed spreading curve view, the region stability heat map view, and the temporal analysis view, together with the commonly used 2D map view, jointly support uncertainty distribution perception, region selection, and temporal analysis, as well as other analysis requirements.

Some rendering tasks, however, require the highest level of confidentiality so that no other party, besides the owner, can read or see the sensitive data. Here we present a direct volume rendering approach that performs volume rendering directly on encrypted volume data by using the homomorphic Paillier encryption algorithm. This approach ensures that the volume data and rendered image are uninterpretable to the rendering server. Our volume rendering pipeline introduces novel approaches for encrypted-data compositing, interpolation, and opacity modulation, as well as simple transfer function design, where each of these routines maintains the highest level of privacy. We present performance and memory overhead analysis that is associated with our privacy-preserving scheme. Our approach is open and secure by design, as opposed to secure through obscurity. Owners of the data only have to keep their secure key confidential to guarantee the privacy of their volume data and the rendered images. Our work is, to our knowledge, the first privacy-preserving remote volume-rendering approach that does not require that any server involved be trustworthy; even in cases when the server is compromised, no sensitive data will be leaked to a foreign party.","article_number":"9222562","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222562","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222562/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222562/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"635","end_page":"644","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1047,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Servers","Cloud computing","Data privacy","Encryption","Transfer functions"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Volume Rendering","Transfer Function","Homomorphic-Encryption","Paillier"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030363","title":"Improving the Usability of Virtual Reality Neuron Tracing with Topological Elements","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":118,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655661","id":37088655661,"full_name":"Torin McDonald","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SCI Institute, University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085735276","id":37085735276,"full_name":"Will Usher","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SCI Institute, University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087129005","id":37087129005,"full_name":"Nate Morrical","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SCI Institute, University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37870001700","id":37870001700,"full_name":"Attila Gyulassy","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SCI Institute, University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, University of Utah, Utah State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086120775","id":37086120775,"full_name":"Steve Petruzza","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SCI Institute, University of Utah, Utah State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Moran Eye Institute, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085895011","id":37085895011,"full_name":"Frederick Federer","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Moran Eye Institute, University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"Moran Eye Institute, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085886744","id":37085886744,"full_name":"Alessandra Angelucci","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Moran Eye Institute, University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284312600","id":37284312600,"full_name":"Valerio Pascucci","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SCI Institute, University of Utah"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Researchers in the field of connectomics are working to reconstruct a map of neural connections in the brain in order to understand at a fundamental level how the brain processes information. Constructing this wiring diagram is done by tracing neurons through high-resolution image stacks acquired with fluorescence microscopy imaging techniques. While a large number of automatic tracing algorithms have been proposed, these frequently rely on local features in the data and fail on noisy data or ambiguous cases, requiring time-consuming manual correction. As a result, manual and semi-automatic tracing methods remain the state-of-the-art for creating accurate neuron reconstructions. We propose a new semi-automatic method that uses topological features to guide users in tracing neurons and integrate this method within a virtual reality (VR) framework previously used for manual tracing. Our approach augments both visualization and interaction with topological elements, allowing rapid understanding and tracing of complex morphologies. In our pilot study, neuroscientists demonstrated a strong preference for using our tool over prior approaches, reported less fatigue during tracing, and commended the ability to better understand possible paths and alternatives. Quantitative evaluation of the traces reveals that users' tracing speed increased, while retaining similar accuracy compared to a fully manual approach.","article_number":"9226101","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9226101","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9226101/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9226101/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"744","end_page":"754","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":577,"insert_date":"20201015","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Neurons","Tools","Manuals","Image reconstruction","Three-dimensional displays","Data visualization","Virtual reality"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Virtual Reality","Morse-Smale Complex","Semi-automatic Neuron Tracing"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Virtually","Retrograde Tracing","Topological Elements","Virtual Neurons","Neuroscience","Topological Features","Manual Method","Semi-automated Method","Ambiguous Cases","Manual Tracing","Information Processing In The Brain","Brain In Order","Neuron Reconstruction","End Point","Critical Point","Neuroanatomical","Shortest Path","Automatic Method","Branch Points","Domain Experts","Immersive System","Qualitative Feedback","Ridgeline","Flashlight","Virtual Reality System","Electron Microscopy Data","Manual Tool","Topological Methods","Precise Interactions","Desktop Software"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030345","title":"No mark is an island: Precision and category repulsion biases in data reproductions","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":119,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Northwestern University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656408","id":37088656408,"full_name":"Caitlyn M.

Yet, existing measures of perceptual precision for data channels (e.g., position, length, orientation, etc.) are based largely on verbal reports of ratio judgments between two values (e.g., [7]). Verbal report conflates multiple sources of error beyond actual visual precision, introducing a ratio computation between these values and a requirement to translate that ratio to a verbal number. Here we observe raw measures of precision by eliminating both ratio computations and verbal reports; we simply ask participants to reproduce marks (a single bar or dot) to match a previously seen one. We manipulated whether the mark was initially presented (and later drawn) alone, paired with a reference (e.g. a second `100%' bar also present at test, or a y-axis for the dot), or integrated with the reference (merging that reference bar into a stacked bar graph, or placing the dot directly on the axis). Reproductions of smaller values were overestimated, and larger values were underestimated, suggesting systematic memory biases. Average reproduction error was around 10% of the actual value, regardless of whether the reproduction was done on a common baseline with the original. In the reference and (especially) the integrated conditions, responses were repulsed from an implicit midpoint of the reference mark, such that values above 50% were overestimated, and values below 50% were underestimated. This reproduction paradigm may serve within a new suite of more fundamental measures of the precision of graphical perception.","article_number":"9288884","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9288884","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9288884/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9288884/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1063","end_page":"1072","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":399,"insert_date":"20201209","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Bars","Visualization","Data visualization","Task analysis","Particle measurements","Atmospheric measurements","Semantics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Cognition and perception","Graphical perception","Perceptual biases","Ratio perception"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Systematic Bias","Systematic Biases","Measurement Precision","Precise Measure","Bar Graphs","Verbal Reports","Reference Marker","Single Dot","Stacked Bar","Common Baseline","Single Bar","Bar Charts","Between-subjects Design","Between-group Design","Pie Chart","Bias Error","Happy Faces","Smiley Face","Smiling Face","Adjustment Method","Adjustment Methods","Reference Condition","Median Error","Range Of Possible Values","Line Chart","Full Range Of Values","Experiment 1b","Experiment 2b","Experiment 1a","Bar Height","Height Of Each Bar","Experiment 2a","Categorical Perception","Positional Encoding","Dot Positions","Position Of Each Dot","Repulsive Effect"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030445","title":"Foveated Encoding for Large High-Resolution Displays","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":120,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085901206","id":37085901206,"full_name":"Florian Frieß","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086386153","id":37086386153,"full_name":"Matthias Braun","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086553797","id":37086553797,"full_name":"Valentin Bruder","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Groningen","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37553894500","id":37553894500,"full_name":"Steffen Frey","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Groningen"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37287276500","id":37287276500,"full_name":"Guido Reina","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268023800","id":37268023800,"full_name":"Thomas Ertl","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Collaborative exploration of scientific data sets across large high-resolution displays requires both high visual detail as well as low-latency transfer of image data (oftentimes inducing the need to trade one for the other).

Humans perceive sharp, colourful details, in the small foveal region around the centre of the field of view, while information in the periphery is perceived blurred and colourless. We account for this by tracking the gaze of observers, and respectively adapting the quality parameter of each macroblock used by the H.264 encoder, considering the so-called visual acuity fall-off. This allows to substantially reduce the required bandwidth with barely noticeable changes in visual quality, which is crucial for collaborative analysis across display walls at different locations.

The first step for intelligent response in visualizations is to enable computers to infer user goals and strategies through observing their interactions with a system. Researchers have proposed multiple techniques to model users, however, their frameworks often depend on the visualization design, interaction space, and dataset. Due to these dependencies, many techniques do not provide a general algorithmic solution to user exploration modeling. In this paper, we construct a series of models based on the dataset and pose user exploration modeling as a Bayesian model selection problem where we maintain a belief over numerous competing models that could explain user interactions. Each of these competing models represent an exploration strategy the user could adopt during a session. The goal of our technique is to make high-level and in-depth inferences about the user by observing their low-level interactions. Although our proposed idea is applicable to various probabilistic model spaces, we demonstrate a specific instance of encoding exploration patterns as competing models to infer information relevance. We validate our technique's ability to infer exploration bias, predict future interactions, and summarize an analytic session using user study datasets. Our results indicate that depending on the application, our method outperforms established baselines for bias detection and future interaction prediction. Finally, we discuss future research directions based on our proposed modeling paradigm and suggest how practitioners can use this method to build intelligent visualization systems that understand users' goals and adapt to improve the exploration process.","article_number":"9224186","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9224186","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9224186/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9224186/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"412","end_page":"421","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":402,"insert_date":"20201014","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Hidden Markov models","Data models","Visual analytics","Analytical models","Bayes methods","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["User Interaction Modeling","Bayesian Machine Learning"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Bayes Factor","Bayesian Model Selection","Visual System","User Study","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Intelligent Systems","Space Model","Interaction Prediction","Technical Ability","Visual Design","Low Levels Of Interaction","Lower-level Interactions","Posterior Probability","Posterior Distribution","Set Of Models","Data Visualization","Active Learning","Subset Of Data","Visual Analysis","Likelihood Function","Data Space","Set Of Interactions","Understanding Of Use","Understanding Of Users","Continuous Attributes","Continuous Dimensions","Continuity Properties","Continuous Properties","Crime Types","Posterior Beliefs","Algorithmic Bias","Algorithmic Discrimination","Face Recognition Bias","Algorithmic Biases","Wall Street Journal","Multidimensional Datasets","Multidimensional Data Sets","Posterior Predictive Distribution","Dimensional Datasets","Interactive Visualization","Understanding Of Models"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030391","title":"Humane Visual AI: Telling the Stories Behind a Medical Condition","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":123,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088541126","id":37088541126,"full_name":"Wonyoung So","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Chair of Cartography, Technical University of Munich (DE)","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088540815","id":37088540815,"full_name":"Edyta P.

In so doing, it was able to associate mentions of medical conditions with those of emotions. To then quantify social aspects, this work designed a probabilistic approach that mines open prescription data from the National Health Service in England to compute the prevalence of drug prescriptions, and to relate such a prevalence to census data. To finally visually communicate each medical condition's biological, psychological, and social aspects through storytelling, we designed a narrative-style layered Martini Glass visualization. In a user study involving 52 participants, after interacting with our visualization, a considerable number of them changed their mind on previously held opinions: 10% gave more importance to the psychological aspects of medical conditions, and 27% were more favourable to the use of social media data in healthcare, suggesting the importance of persuasive elements in interactive visualizations.","article_number":"9222264","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222264","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222264/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222264/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"678","end_page":"688","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":863,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Psychology","Data visualization","Medical conditions","Reddit","Drugs","Biology"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["complex problem communication","storytelling","AI","social media data","healthcare","Martini Glass structure"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Social Media","Social Platforms","Mental State","Psychological Characteristics","Psychological Processes","Psychological State","Psychological Aspects","Persuasive","Persuade","Social Aspects","National Health Service","Aspects Of Biology","Interactive Visualization","Social Media Data","Social Media Analytics","Aspects Of Status","Aspects Of State","Aspects Of Conditions","Prescription Data","Visual Communication","Medical Aspects","Services In England","Health Service In England","Prevalence Of Prescriptions","Rheumatoid Arthritis","Rheumatic","Rheumatology","Body Parts","Twitter","Retweets","Use Of Social Media","Social Media Users","Prevalence Of Conditions","Biopsychosocial Model","Biopsychosocial Approach","Artificial Intelligence In Healthcare","Artificial Intelligence In Health Care","Human-in-the-loop","Human In The Loop","Radar Chart","Radar Graph","Conditional Random Field","Layer Technique","Drug Name","Pointwise Mutual Information","Choropleth Maps","Brain Fog"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030405","title":"Insights From Experiments With Rigor in an EvoBio Design Study","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":124,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656265","id":37088656265,"full_name":"Jen Rogers","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"Washington State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656394","id":37088656394,"full_name":"Austin H.

In recent work we proposed a new, interpretivist perspective on design study and six companion criteria for rigor that highlight the opportunities for researchers to contribute knowledge that extends beyond visualization idioms and software. In this work we conducted a year-long collaboration with evolutionary biologists to develop an interactive tool for visual exploration of multivariate datasets and phylogenetic trees. During this design study we experimented with methods to support three of the rigor criteria: ABUNDANT, REFLEXIVE, and TRANSPARENT. As a result we contribute two novel visualization techniques for the analysis of multivariate phylogenetic datasets, three methodological recommendations for conducting design studies drawn from reflections over our process of experimentation, and two writing devices for reporting interpretivist design study.

We describe a novel ML-testing framework that combines the traditional statistical hypothesis testing (commonly used in empirical research) with logical reasoning about the conclusions of multiple hypotheses. The framework defines a controlled configuration for testing a number of hypotheses as to whether and how some extra information about a “concept” or “feature” may benefit or hinder an ML model. Because reasoning multiple hypotheses is not always straightforward, we provide HypoML as a visual analysis tool, with which, the multi-thread testing results are first transformed to analytical results using statistical and logical inferences, and then to a visual representation for rapid observation of the conclusions and the logical flow between the testing results and hypotheses. We have applied HypoML to a number of hypothesized concepts, demonstrating the intuitive and explainable nature of the visual analysis.","article_number":"9222284","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222284","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222284/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222284/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1417","end_page":"1426","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":598,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Analytical models","Testing","Data models","Computational modeling","Tools","Visualization","Neurons"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","model-developmental visualization","machine learning","neural network","hypothesis test","HypoML"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Learning Models","Machine Learning Models","Visual Analysis","Hypothesis Testing","Testing Results","Test Outcomes","Visual Representation","Visualization Tool","Multiple Hypothesis","Extra Information","Statistical Hypothesis","Logical Reasoning","Statistical Hypothesis Testing","Logical Flow","Logical Inference","Rational Inference","Visual Analytics Tool","Training Dataset","Training Data Set","Convolutional Neural Network","Open-source Software","Open Software","Open Source Software","Open Coding","Set Of Analyses","Set Of Results","Set Of Outcomes","Inference Rules","Transformation Rules","Logical Rules","Circle Area","Ground Truth Labels","Extra Data","Logical Analysis","Convolutional Neural Network Model","Partial Model","Types Of Input Data","Visual Encoding","Template Model"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030379","title":"Visual Analysis of Large Multivariate Scattered Data using Clustering and Probabilistic Summaries","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":126,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Karlsruhe Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086172474","id":37086172474,"full_name":"Tobias Rapp","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Karlsruhe Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102300","id":37087102300,"full_name":"Christoph Peters","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Karlsruhe Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37395703400","id":37395703400,"full_name":"Carsten Dachsbacher","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Rapidly growing data sizes of scientific simulations pose significant challenges for interactive visualization and analysis techniques. In this work, we propose a compact probabilistic representation to interactively visualize large scattered datasets. In contrast to previous approaches that represent blocks of volumetric data using probability distributions, we model clusters of arbitrarily structured multivariate data. In detail, we discuss how to efficiently represent and store a high-dimensional distribution for each cluster. We observe that it suffices to consider low-dimensional marginal distributions for two or three data dimensions at a time to employ common visual analysis techniques. Based on this observation, we represent high-dimensional distributions by combinations of low-dimensional Gaussian mixture models. We discuss the application of common interactive visual analysis techniques to this representation. In particular, we investigate several frequency-based views, such as density plots in 1D and 2D, density-based parallel coordinates, and a time histogram. We visualize the uncertainty introduced by the representation, discuss a level-of-detail mechanism, and explicitly visualize outliers. Furthermore, we propose a spatial visualization by splatting anisotropic 3D Gaussians for which we derive a closed-form solution. Lastly, we describe the application of brushing and linking to this clustered representation. Our evaluation on several large, real-world datasets demonstrates the scaling of our approach.","article_number":"9222076","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222076","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222076/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222076/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1580","end_page":"1590","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":496,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Probabilistic logic","Data models","Visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Gaussian mixture model"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["interactive visual analysis","probabilistic data summaries","multivariate data","scattered data","Gaussian mixture models","Gaussian rendering"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Histogram","Interaction Analysis","Multivariate Data","Multivariate Statistics","Density Plots","Marginal Distribution","Gaussian Mixture Model","Distribution Of Clusters","Visualization Techniques","Interactive Visualization","Compact Representation","Volumetric Data","Time Histograms","Interaction Techniques","Spatial Visualization","3D Gaussian","Low-dimensional Model","Lower-dimensional Models","Parallel Coordinates","Time Step","Scatter Plot","High-dimensional Models","Higher-dimensional Models","Degree Of Interest","Single Gaussian","Wasserstein Distance","Wasserstein Metric","Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics","Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics","Gaussian Components","Transfer Function","Alpha Matte","Alpha Maps","Alpha Blending","Alpha Channel","Dark Matter","Spatial Domain"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030431","title":"Mode Surfaces of Symmetric Tensor Fields: Topological Analysis and Seamless Extraction","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":127,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100795","id":37087100795,"full_name":"Botong Qu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086255270","id":37086255270,"full_name":"Lawrence Roy","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085665492","id":37085665492,"full_name":"Yue Zhang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37398562200","id":37398562200,"full_name":"Eugene Zhang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Mode surfaces are the generalization of degenerate curves and neutral surfaces, which constitute 3D symmetric tensor field topology. Efficient analysis and visualization of mode surfaces can provide additional insight into not only degenerate curves and neutral surfaces, but also how these features transition into each other.

Existing mode surface extraction methods can miss features in the surfaces. Moreover, the mode surfaces extracted from neighboring cells have gaps, which make their subsequent analysis difficult. In this paper, we provide novel analysis on the topological structures of mode surfaces, including a common parameterization of all mode surfaces of a tensor field using 2D asymmetric tensors. This allows us to not only better understand the structures in mode surfaces and their interactions with degenerate curves and neutral surfaces, but also develop an efficient algorithm to seamlessly extract mode surfaces, including neutral surfaces. The seamless mode surfaces enable efficient analysis of their geometric structures, such as the principal curvature directions.

During this iterative process, they apply optimizations, analyze the resulting code, and modify the compilation until they are satisfied. Understanding what the compiler did with the code is crucial to this process but is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. Users need to navigate through thousands of lines of binary code and correlate it to source code concepts to understand the results of the compilation and to identify optimizations. We present a design study in collaboration with program developers and performance analysts. Our collaborators work with various artifacts related to the program such as binary code, source code, control flow graphs, and call graphs. Through interviews, feedback, and pair-analytics sessions, we analyzed their tasks and workflow. Based on this task analysis and through a human-centric design process, we designed a visual analytics system Compilation Navigator (CcNav) to aid exploration of the effects of compiler optimizations on the program. CcNav provides a streamlined workflow and a unified context that integrates disparate artifacts. CcNav supports consistent interactions across all the artifacts making it easy to correlate binary code with source code concepts. CcNav enables users to navigate and filter large binary code to identify and summarize optimizations such as inlining, vectorization, loop unrolling, and code hoisting. We evaluate CcNav through guided sessions and semi-structured interviews. We reflect on our design process, particularly the immersive elements, and on the transferability of design studies through our experience with a previous design study on program analysis.","article_number":"9222367","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222367","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222367/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222367/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"667","end_page":"677","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":673,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Optimization","Tools","Visualization","Binary codes","Navigation","Task analysis","Debugging"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Design study","program analysis","compilation","binary code","transferability","immersion"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Binary Code","Compiler Optimization","Navigation","Design Process","Source Code","Data Compression","Call Graph","Call-graph","Control Flow Graph","Prototype","High-performance Computing","Supercomputer","Domain Experts","Rating Task","Evaluation Task","Static Analysis","Static Analysis Tools","Reverse Engineering","Reverse-engineering","Visual Design","Instruction Set Architecture","Active Electron","Evaluation Session","Session Rating","Collaborative Analysis","Function Calls"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030384","title":"Interactive Visual Study of Multiple Attributes Learning Model of X-Ray Scattering Images","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":129,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Kent State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655389","id":37088655389,"full_name":"Xinyi Huang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Kent State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Kent State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085681542","id":37085681542,"full_name":"Suphanut Jamonnak","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Kent State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Kent State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37277701200","id":37277701200,"full_name":"Ye Zhao","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Kent State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085898991","id":37085898991,"full_name":"Boyu Wang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Stony Brook University"]}},{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945011500","id":37945011500,"full_name":"Minh Hoai","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Stony Brook University"]}},{"affiliation":"Brookhaven National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085902083","id":37085902083,"full_name":"Kevin Yager","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Brookhaven National Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"Brookhaven National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085905011","id":37085905011,"full_name":"Wei Xu","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Brookhaven National Laboratory"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Existing interactive visualization tools for deep learning are mostly applied to the training, debugging, and refinement of neural network models working on natural images.

Line charts are commonly used to visualize a series of data samples. When the number of samples is large, or the data are noisy, smoothing can be applied to make the signal more apparent. However, there are a wide variety of smoothing techniques available, and the effectiveness of each depends upon both nature of the data and the visual analytics task at hand. To date, the visualization community lacks a summary work for analyzing and classifying the various smoothing methods available. In this paper, we establish a framework, based on 8 measures of the line smoothing effectiveness tied to 8 low-level visual analytics tasks. We then analyze 12 methods coming from 4 commonly used classes of line chart smoothing-rank filters, convolutional filters, frequency domain filters, and subsampling. The results show that while no method is ideal for all situations, certain methods, such as Gaussian filters and TOPOLOGY-based subsampling, perform well in general. Other methods, such as low-pass CUTOFF filters and Douglas-peucker subsampling, perform well for specific visual analytics tasks. Almost as importantly, our framework demonstrates that several methods, including the commonly used UNIFORM subsampling, produce low-quality results, and should, therefore, be avoided, if possible.","article_number":"9222269","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222269","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222269/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222269/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1536","end_page":"1546","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":591,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Smoothing methods","Task analysis","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Market research","Frequency-domain analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Line chart","data smoothing","time-series"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Line Chart","Smoothing Technique","Smooth Technique","Effective Measures","Frequency Domain","Visual Task","Gaussian Filter","Cut-off Filter","Frequency Domain Filtering","Frequency-domain Filtering","Spearman Correlation","Spearman’s Rank","Spearman’s Rank Correlation","Changes In Area","Sum Of Values","Local Maxima","Trends Data","Long-term Trends","Properties Of Data","Data Attributes","Stock Price","Task Accuracy","Median Filter","Number Of Months","Discrete Fourier Transform","Peak Data","Topological Data Analysis","Level Of Smoothness","Smooth Level","Wasserstein Distance","Wasserstein Metric","Convolution Method","Convolution Methods","Input Point","Efficacy Of Techniques","Efficacy Of These Techniques","Approximate Entropy","Entropy Calculation","Entropy Estimation","Visual Complexity","Visual Design"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030369","title":"Investigating Visual Analysis of Differentially Private Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":131,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Massachusetts, Amherst","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656002","id":37088656002,"full_name":"Dan Zhang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Massachusetts, Amherst"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Massachusetts, Amherst","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591344300","id":37591344300,"full_name":"Ali Sarvghad","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Massachusetts, Amherst"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Massachusetts, Amherst","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37671502100","id":37671502100,"full_name":"Gerome Miklau","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Massachusetts, Amherst"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Differential Privacy is an emerging privacy model with increasing popularity in many domains.

However, noise-induced data perturbations can alter visual patterns and impact the utility of a private visualization. We still know little about the challenges and opportunities for visual data exploration and analysis using private visualizations. As a first step towards filling this gap, we conducted a crowdsourced experiment, measuring participants' performance under three levels of privacy (high, low, non-private) for combinations of eight analysis tasks and four visualization types (bar chart, pie chart, line chart, scatter plot). Our findings show that for participants' accuracy for summary tasks (e.g., find clusters in data) was higher that value tasks (e.g., retrieve a certain value). We also found that under DP, pie chart and line chart offer similar or better accuracy than bar chart.

The use of zooming in scatterplots can help alleviate this problem. With multiple zoom levels, more screen real estate is available, allowing objects to be placed in a less crowded way. We call this type of visualization scalable scatterplot visualizations, or SSV for short. Despite the potential of SSVs, existing systems and toolkits fall short in supporting the authoring of SSVs due to three limitations. First, many systems have limited scalability, assuming that data fits in the memory of one computer. Second, too much developer work, e.g., using custom code to generate mark layouts or render objects, is required. Third, many systems focus on only a small subset of the SSV design space (e.g. supporting a specific type of visual marks). To address these limitations, we have developed Kyrix-S, a system for easy authoring of SSVs at scale. Kyrix-S derives a declarative grammar that enables specification of a variety of SSVs in a few tens of lines of code, based on an existing survey of scatterplot tasks and designs. The declarative grammar is supported by a distributed layout algorithm which automatically places visual marks onto zoom levels. We store data in a multi-node database and use multi-node spatial indexes to achieve interactive browsing of large SSVs. Extensive experiments show that 1) Kyrix-S enables interactive browsing of SSVs of billions of objects, with response times under 500ms and 2) Kyrix-S achieves 4X-9X reduction in specification compared to a state-of-the-art authoring system.","article_number":"9222038","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222038","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222038/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222038/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"401","end_page":"411","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":731,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Data visualization","Layout","Grammar","Scalability","Semantics","Heating systems"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["pan/zoom visualization","declarative grammar","scalability","performance optimization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Big Data","Scatter Plot Visualization","Scatterplot Visualization","Response Time","Design Space","Big Datasets","Big Data Sets","Visual Markers","Spatial Index","Spatial Indices","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Limited Scalability","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Zoom Level","Heatmap","C=O Groups","Top Level","2D Plane","Information Aggregation","Spatial Partitioning","Partition Of Space","Distributed Algorithm","Low Flexibility","Semantic Space","Clustering Objective","Profiles Of Players","Excess Density"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030394","title":"Direct Volume Rendering with Nonparametric Models of Uncertainty","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":133,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Utah, Scientific Computing & Imaging (SCI) Institute, Salt Lake City","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077916100","id":37077916100,"full_name":"Tushar M.

In this paper, we address the limitations of the existing DVR framework by extending the DVR framework for nonparametric distributions. We exploit the quantile interpolation technique to derive probability distributions representing uncertainty in viewing-ray sample intensities in closed form, which allows for accurate and efficient computation. We evaluate our proposed nonparametric statistical models through qualitative and quantitative comparisons with the mean-field and parametric statistical models, such as uniform and Gaussian, as well as Gaussian mixtures. In addition, we present an extension of the state-of-the-art rendering parametric framework to 2D TFs for improved DVR classifications.

The text view is the necessary textual basis to verify conclusions from the other views and the annotation process. Linking the views and interaction techniques for visual filtering, studying the evolution of stance within a subset of essays and scrutinizing the order of argumentative units enable a deep analysis of essay corpora.

In this paper, we propose to establish a test suite for evaluating the design of colormaps. With such a suite, the users can observe the effects when different continuous colormaps are applied to planar scalar fields that may exhibit various characteristic features, such as jumps, local extrema, ridge or valley lines, different distributions of scalar values, different gradients, different signal frequencies, different levels of noise, and so on. The suite also includes an expansible collection of real-world data sets including the most popular data for colormap testing in the visualization literature. The test suite has been integrated into a web-based application for creating continuous colormaps (https://ccctool.com/), facilitating close inter-operation between design and evaluation processes.

Using a grid, we can rapidly trace rays back to the observer through the distorted spacetime, avoiding the heavy workload of standard tracing solutions at real-time rates. By using a novel interpolation technique we can also simulate an observer path by smoothly transitioning between multiple grids.

Rather than treating mathematical knots as if they were 3D ropes, our interface is designed to assist the user to interact with knots with the right sequence of mathematically legal moves. Our knot interface allows one to sketch and untangle knots by proposing the Reidemeister moves, and can guide the user to untangle mathematical knots to the fewest possible number of crossings by suggesting the moves needed. The system highlights parts of the knot where the Reidemeister moves are applicable, suggests the possible moves, and constrains the user's drawing to legal moves only. This ongoing suggestion is based on a Reidemeister move analyzer, that reads the evolving knot in its Gauss code and predicts the needed Reidemeister moves towards the fewest possible number of crossings. For our principal test case of mathematical knot diagrams, this for the first time permits us to visualize, analyze, and deform them in a mathematical visual interface. In addition, understanding of a fairly long mathematical deformation sequence in our interface can be aided by visual analysis and comparison over the identified “key moments” where only critical changes occur in the sequence. Our knot interface allows users to track and trace mathematical knot deformation with a significantly reduced number of visual frames containing only the Reidemeister moves being applied. All these combine to allow a much cleaner exploratory interface for us to analyze and study mathematical knots and their dynamics in topological space.","article_number":"9216595","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9216595","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216595/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216595/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"593","end_page":"602","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":306,"insert_date":"20201007","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three-dimensional displays","Visualization","Image reconstruction","Strain","Geometry","Law"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Knot theory","Reidemeister moves","Gauss code","Mathematical visualization","Suggestive interface"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Complicated Structure","Key Moments","Critical Changes","Fewest Number","Topological Space","Track And Trace","Home Devices","Track-and-trace","Order Tracking","Visual Interface","Key Step","Numerical Methods","Numerical Method","Numerous Methods","Numerical Approach","Numerous Approaches","Geometric Structure","3D Point","Visual Elements","Force Model","Computer Graphics","User Testing","Foreground Pixels","Non-expert Users"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3028958","title":"Auditing the Sensitivity of Graph-based Ranking with Visual Analytics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":139,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Arizona State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101871","id":37087101871,"full_name":"Tiankai Xie","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101494","id":37087101494,"full_name":"Yuxin Ma","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085382649","id":37085382649,"full_name":"Hanghang Tong","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Florida","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37394239100","id":37394239100,"full_name":"My T.

The answers to such questions are typically returned in the form of a ranked list, and graph-based ranking methods are widely used in industrial information retrieval settings. However, these ranking algorithms have a variety of sensitivities, and even small changes in rank can lead to vast reductions in product sales and page hits. As such, there is a need for tools and methods that can help model developers and analysts explore the sensitivities of graph ranking algorithms with respect to perturbations within the graph structure. In this paper, we present a visual analytics framework for explaining and exploring the sensitivity of any graph-based ranking algorithm by performing perturbation-based what-if analysis. We demonstrate our framework through three case studies inspecting the sensitivity of two classic graph-based ranking algorithms (PageRank and HITS) as applied to rankings in political news media and social networks.","article_number":"9216512","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9216512","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216512/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216512/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1459","end_page":"1469","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":570,"insert_date":"20201007","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Sensitivity","Perturbation methods","Blogs","Visual analytics","Task analysis","Layout","Hypertext systems"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Graph-based ranking","sensitivity analysis","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Social Networks","Graph Structure","Ranking Method","Ranking Methods","Graph-based Methods","Graph-based Method","Rank Changes","Page Views","Pageviews","Ranking Algorithm","Graph-based Algorithm","Visual Framework","Sensitive Method","Sensitive Methods","Sensitivity Index","Sensitive Indicator","Class Labels","Nodes In The Graph","Analysis Tasks","Design Requirements","Domain Experts","Value Of Node","Ranking Results","Node Ranking","Visual Design","Node Removal","PageRank Algorithm","Political Opinions","Freedom Of Thought","Freedom Of Conscience","Graph Layout","Graph Drawing","Pr Values","Potential Perturbation","Teleportation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030388","title":"Visualization of Human Spine Biomechanics for Spinal Surgery","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":140,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Jena, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087099469","id":37087099469,"full_name":"Pepe Eulzer","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Jena, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Koblenz-Landau, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086793138","id":37086793138,"full_name":"Sabine Bauer","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Koblenz-Landau, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Spine Surgery, Cath.

Biomechanical simulation is a state-of-the-art technique for analyzing load distributions of spinal structures. Through the inclusion of patient-specific data, such simulations may facilitate personalized treatment and customized surgical interventions. Difficulties in spine modelling and simulation can be partly attributed to poor result representation, which may also be a hindrance when introducing such techniques into a clinical environment. Comparisons of measurements across multiple similar anatomical structures and the integration of temporal data make commonly available diagrams and charts insufficient for an intuitive and systematic display of results. Therefore, we facilitate methods such as multiple coordinated views, abstraction and focus and context to display simulation outcomes in a dedicated tool. By linking the result data with patient-specific anatomy, we make relevant parameters tangible for clinicians. Furthermore, we introduce new concepts to show the directions of impact force vectors, which were not accessible before. We integrated our toolset into a spine segmentation and simulation pipeline and evaluated our methods with both surgeons and biomechanical researchers. When comparing our methods against standard representations that are currently in use, we found increases in accuracy and speed in data exploration tasks. In a qualitative review, domain experts deemed the tool highly useful when dealing with simulation result data, which typically combines time-dependent patient movement and the resulting force distributions on spinal structures.","article_number":"9222085","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222085","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222085/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222085/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"700","end_page":"710","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":671,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Biological system modeling","Data visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Load modeling","Biomechanics","Surgery","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Medical visualization","bioinformatics","coordinated views","focus and context","biomechanical simulation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Biomechanics","Cyborg","Simulation Results","Domain Experts","Multiple Structures","Load Distribution","Load Sharing","Load-sharing","Force Vector","Force Distribution","Patient Movement","Spinal Segments","Spine Structure","Standard Representation","Patient-specific Data","Patient Specific Data","Exploration Task","Biomechanical Research","Vertebrate","Vertebrae","Medical Imaging","Clinical Imaging","Diagnostic Imaging","Back Pain","Shear Force","Multiple Datasets","Multiple Data Sets","Lumbar Spine","Lumbar Vertebra","Lumbar Vertebrae","Intervertebral Disc","Intervertebral Disk","Thoracic Spine","Thoracic Vertebrae","Dorsal Vertebra","Dorsal Vertebrae","Thoracic Vertebra","Line Chart","Cervical Spine","Facet Joint","Postzygapophysis","Zygapophyses","Articular Process","Prezygapophysis","Faulty Data","Color Map","Colour Map","Colormap","Direction Of Force","Force-directed","Motion Data","Visual Framework"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030368","title":"Implicit Multidimensional Projection of Local Subspaces","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":141,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Shandong University, Qingdao","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656418","id":37088656418,"full_name":"Rongzheng Bian","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shandong University, Qingdao"]}},{"affiliation":"Shandong University, Qingdao","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656154","id":37088656154,"full_name":"Yumeng Xue","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shandong University, Qingdao"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073908100","id":37073908100,"full_name":"Liang Zhou","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"CNIC, CAS","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38026660700","id":38026660700,"full_name":"Jian Zhang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["CNIC, CAS"]}},{"affiliation":"Peking University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37600013700","id":37600013700,"full_name":"Baoquan Chen","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Peking University"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268045000","id":37268045000,"full_name":"Daniel Weiskopf","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart"]}},{"affiliation":"Shandong University, Qingdao","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085804605","id":37085804605,"full_name":"Yunhai Wang","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shandong University, Qingdao"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We propose a visualization method to understand the effect of multidimensional projection on local subspaces, using implicit function differentiation.

Our method is able to analyze the shape and directional information of the local subspace to gain more insights into the global structure of the data through the perception of local structures. Local subspaces are fitted by multidimensional ellipses that are spanned by basis vectors. An accurate and efficient vector transformation method is proposed based on analytical differentiation of multidimensional projections formulated as implicit functions. The results are visualized as glyphs and analyzed using a full set of specifically-designed interactions supported in our efficient web-based visualization tool. The usefulness of our method is demonstrated using various multi- and high-dimensional benchmark datasets.

We consider two versions of the problem: fixed projections and variable projections. MPSE with fixed projections takes as input a set of pairwise distance matrices defined on the data points, along with the same number of projections and embeds the points in 3D so that the pairwise distances are preserved in the given projections. MPSE with variable projections takes as input a set of pairwise distance matrices and embeds the points in 3D while also computing the appropriate projections that preserve the pairwise distances. The proposed approach can be useful in multiple scenarios: from creating simultaneous embedding of multiple graphs on the same set of vertices, to reconstructing a 3D object from multiple 2D snapshots, to analyzing data from multiple points of view. We provide a functional prototype of MPSE that is based on an adaptive and stochastic generalization of multi-dimensional scaling to multiple distances and multiple variable projections. We provide an extensive quantitative evaluation with datasets of different sizes and using different number of projections, as well as several examples that illustrate the quality of the resulting solutions.","article_number":"9241407","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9241407","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9241407/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9241407/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1569","end_page":"1579","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":334,"insert_date":"20201027","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three-dimensional displays","Data visualization","Layout","Two dimensional displays","Visualization","Dimensionality reduction","Optimization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Graph visualization","Dimensionality reduction","Multidimensional scaling","Mental map preservation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Distance Matrix","Distance Matrices","Pairwise Distances","Number Of Projects","3D Point","2D Projection","Multiple Viewpoints","Functional Prototype","Datasets Of Different Sizes","Data Sets Of Different Sizes","Learning Rate","Gradient Descent","Steepest Descent","Related Data","3D Reconstruction","3D Space","3-dimensional Space","Stochastic Gradient Descent","SGD Optimizer","Stochastic Gradient","Number Of Data Points","Stress Values","Orthogonal Matrix","Orthonormal Matrix","Orthogonal Transformation","Orthogonal Matrices","Dissimilarity Matrix","Dissimilarity Matrices","3D Visualization","Partial Optimization","Visualization Of Relationships","Pairwise Dissimilarity","Planar Graphs","Planar Maps","Random Initialization","Pairs Of Trees","Interactive Visualization","Adaptive Learning Rate","2D Images","Visibility Graph"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030356","title":"Visilant: Visual Support for the Exploration and Analytical Process Tracking in Criminal Investigations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":147,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Masaryk University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656049","id":37088656049,"full_name":"Kristína Zákopčanová","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Masaryk University"]}},{"affiliation":"Masaryk University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656767","id":37088656767,"full_name":"Marko Řeháček","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Masaryk University"]}},{"affiliation":"Masaryk University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656664","id":37088656664,"full_name":"Jozef Bátrna","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Masaryk University"]}},{"affiliation":"Masaryk University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656562","id":37088656562,"full_name":"Daniel Plakinger","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Masaryk University"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Bergen and Rainfall AS Bergen","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085901852","id":37085901852,"full_name":"Sergej Stoppel","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bergen and Rainfall AS Bergen"]}},{"affiliation":"Masaryk University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085711031","id":37085711031,"full_name":"Barbora Kozlíková","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Masaryk University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The daily routine of criminal investigators consists of a thorough analysis of highly complex and heterogeneous data of crime cases. Such data can consist of case descriptions, testimonies, criminal networks, spatial and temporal information, and virtually any other data that is relevant for the case. Criminal investigators work under heavy time pressure to analyze the data for relationships, propose and verify several hypotheses, and derive conclusions, while the data can be incomplete or inconsistent and is changed and updated throughout the investigation, as new findings are added to the case. Based on a four-year intense collaboration with criminalists, we present a conceptual design for a visual tool supporting the investigation workflow and Visilant, a web-based tool for the exploration and analysis of criminal data guided by the proposed design. Visilant aims to support namely the exploratory part of the investigation pipeline, from case overview, through exploration and hypothesis generation, to the case presentation. Visilant tracks the reasoning process and as the data is changing, it informs investigators which hypotheses are affected by the data change and should be revised. The tool was evaluated by senior criminology experts within two sessions and their feedback is summarized in the paper.

Geologists measure and interpret 3D DOMs, create sedimentary logs and combine them in `correlation panels' to map the extents of key geological horizons, and build a stratigraphic model to understand their position in the ancient landscape. Currently, the creation of correlation panels is completely manual and therefore time-consuming, and inflexible. With InCorr we present a visualization solution that encompasses a 3D logging tool and an interactive data-driven correlation panel that evolves with the stratigraphic analysis. For the creation of InCorr we closely cooperated with leading planetary geologists in the form of a design study. We verify our results by recreating an existing correlation analysis with InCorr and validate our correlation panel against a manually created illustration. Further, we conducted a user-study with a wider circle of geologists. Our evaluation shows that InCorr efficiently supports the domain experts in tackling their research questions and that it has the potential to significantly impact how geologists work with digital outcrop representations in general.","article_number":"9234473","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9234473","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9234473/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9234473/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"755","end_page":"764","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":334,"insert_date":"20201021","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Correlation","Three-dimensional displays","Tools","Geologic measurements","Rocks","Solid modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Geographic / geospatial visualization","remote sensing geology","digital outcrop analysis","integration of spatial and non-spatial data visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive","Digital Outcrop","Correlation Analysis","3D Tool","Geological Analysis","Stratigraphic Analysis","Dashed Line","Hierarchical Structure","Hierarchical Organization","Grain Size","Time Of Occurrence","Sojourn Time","Rock Types","Image Synthesis","Rendering Engine","3D Renderings","Elevation Difference","Cardinal Directions","Compass Direction","Cardinal Points","Rock Outcrops","Rocky Outcrops","Interaction Design","Reference Plane","Interpretation Tools","Stereo Camera","Visual Encoding","Geological Field","Set Of Contacts","Running Example","Workflow","Rock Strata","Rock Layer"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030355","title":"Guidelines For Pursuing and Revealing Data Abstractions","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":149,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Arizona","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085905494","id":37085905494,"full_name":"Alex Bigelow","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Arizona"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Arizona","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086638338","id":37086638338,"full_name":"Katy Williams","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Arizona"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Arizona","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490580100","id":38490580100,"full_name":"Katherine E.

We conduct a Grounded Theory analysis that (1) interprets the extent to which latent data abstractions exist, (2) reveals the far-reaching effects that the interventionist pursuit of such abstractions can have on data workers, (3) describes why and when data workers may resist such explorations, and (4) suggests how to take advantage of opportunities and mitigate risks through transparency about visualization research perspectives and agendas. We then use the themes and codes discovered in the Grounded Theory analysis to develop guidelines for data abstraction in visualization projects.

However, these complex hardware and software systems, if not properly designed, can experience failures that can compromise the safety of the vehicle, its occupants, and the surrounding environment. For example, a system to activate the brakes to avoid a collision saves lives when it functions properly, but could lead to tragic outcomes if the brakes were applied in a way that's inconsistent with the design. Broadly speaking, the analysis performed to minimize such risks falls into a systems engineering domain called Functional Safety. In this paper, we present SafetyLens, a visual data analysis tool to assist engineers and analysts in analyzing automotive Functional Safety datasets. SafetyLens combines techniques including network exploration and visual comparison to help analysts perform domain-specific tasks. This paper presents the design study with domain experts that resulted in the design guidelines, the tool, and user feedback.","article_number":"9222266","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9222266","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222266/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222266/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340023,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"Feb. 2021","start_page":"1688","end_page":"1697","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":561,"insert_date":"20201013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Hazards","Acceleration","Visualization","Automotive engineering","Brakes","Tools"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual data analysis","Design study","Network visualization","Functional safety","Automotive engineering"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Vehicle Safety","Car Safety","Impact Protection","Automotive Safety","Systems Engineering","Technological Systems","Visualization Tool","Domain Experts","User Feedback","Visual Analytics Tool","Prototype","Design Process","Visualization Techniques","User-centered","Human-centered Design","User-centered Design","Hazardous Effects","Effects Of Hazards","Hazardous Events","Hazard Events","Design Goals","Multiple Projects","Common Node","Usage Scenarios","User Tasks","Domain-specific Languages","Adaptive Cruise Control","Automotive Systems","Safety Goals","Visual Literacy"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3033649","title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics [Conference announcement]","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":151,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Announcement: IEEE Visual Analytics Science & Technology Conference, IEEE Information Visualization Conference, and IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference.
