While a variety of automated methods have been developed to identify when concept drift occurs, there is limited support for analysts who need to understand and correct their models when drift is detected. In this paper, we present a visual analytics method, DriftVis, to support model builders and analysts in the identification and correction of concept drift in streaming data. DriftVis combines a distribution-based drift detection method with a streaming scatterplot to support the analysis of drift caused by the distribution changes of data streams and to explore the impact of these changes on the model’s accuracy. A quantitative experiment and two case studies on weather prediction and text classification have been conducted to demonstrate our proposed tool and illustrate how visual analytics can be used to support the detection, examination, and correction of concept drift.","article_number":"9308631","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9308631","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9308631/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9308631/","publication_title":"2020 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2020","publication_number":9308302,"is_number":9308614,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2020","start_page":"12","end_page":"23","citing_paper_count":19,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":977,"insert_date":"20210104","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Analytical models","Adaptation models","Visual analytics","Text categorization","Weather forecasting","Data visualization","Predictive models","Data models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Concept drift","streaming data","change detection","scatterplot","t-SNE."]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Concept Drift","Drift Detection","Data Distribution","Changes In Distribution","Data Streams","Drift Correction","Distribution-based Methods","Distribution-based Method","Machine Learning","Machine-learning","Model Performance","Sample Groups","Convolutional Neural Network","Recurrent Neural Network","False Alarm","Clustering Results","Similar Samples","Ensemble Model","Gaussian Mixture Model","Ground Truth Labels","Base Learners","Adversarial Examples","Gaussian Components","Green Components","Line Chart","Latent Dirichlet Allocation","Blue Component","Subset Of Clusters","Variational Autoencoder","Variety Of Tools","Diverse Tools","Bayesian Information Criterion","Bayesian Information Criteria"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8010-6","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8009-0","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00009","title":"Visual Analytics of Multivariate Event Sequence Data in Racquet Sports","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-7281-8010-6","rank":2,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"The State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088755868","id":37088755868,"full_name":"Jiang Wu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"The State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088750906","id":37088750906,"full_name":"Ziyang Guo","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"The State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088753609","id":37088753609,"full_name":"Zuobin Wang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"The State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088757745","id":37088757745,"full_name":"Qingyang Xu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"The State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","id":37407308300,"full_name":"Yingcai Wu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"In this work, we propose a generic visual analytics framework to support tactic analysis based on data collected from racquet sports (such as tennis and badminton). The proposed approach models each rally in a game as a sequence of hits (i.e., events) until one athlete scores a point. Each hit can be described with a set of attributes, such as the positions of the ball and the techniques used to hit the ball (such as drive and volley in tennis). Thus, the mentioned sequence of hits can be viewed as a multivariate event sequence. By detecting and analyzing the multivariate subsequences that frequently occur in the rallies (namely, tactical patterns), athletes can gain insights into the playing styles adopted by their opponents, and therefore help them identify systematic weaknesses of the opponents and develop counter strategies in matches. To support such analysis effectively, we propose a steerable multivariate sequential pattern mining algorithm with adjustable weights over event attributes, such that the domain expert can obtain frequent tactical patterns according to the attributes specified by himself. We also propose a re-configurable glyph design to help users simultaneously analyze multiple attributes of the hits. The framework further supports comparative analysis of the tactical patterns, e.g., for different athletes or the same athlete playing under different conditions. By applying the framework on two datasets collected in tennis and badminton matches, we demonstrate that the system is generic and effective for tactic analysis in sports and can help identify signature techniques used by individual athletes. Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of the proposed approach based on the feedback from the domain experts.","article_number":"9308628","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9308628","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9308628/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9308628/","publication_title":"2020 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2020","publication_number":9308302,"is_number":9308614,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2020","start_page":"36","end_page":"47","citing_paper_count":19,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":881,"insert_date":"20210104","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Sports","Data visualization","Visual analytics","Data mining","Task analysis","Games","Data models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Sports Analytics","Event Sequence","Multivariate Data","Sequential Pattern Mining","Comparative Analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Sequence Of Events","Visual Analysis","Multivariate Data","Multivariate Statistics","Racquet Sports","Event Sequence Data","Multiple Dimensions","Multiple Attributes","Multiple Properties","Sequence Patterns","Domain Experts","Frequent Pattern","Multivariate Pattern","Visual Framework","Pattern Mining","Multivariate Algorithm","Sequential Pattern Mining","Itemset Mining","Sequence Mining","Ball Position","Sports Analytics","Web Application","Bar Charts","Analysis Tasks","Sport Science","Pattern Length","Pattern Lengths","Attribute Weights","Usage Scenarios","Minimum Description Length","Unusual Patterns","Categorical Attributes","Classification Properties","Attribute Classification","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Visual Metaphors","Visual Encoding","Team Of Experts"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8010-6","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8009-0","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00006","title":"ConceptExplorer: Visual Analysis of Concept Drifts in Multi-source Time-series Data","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-7281-8010-6","rank":3,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086258030","id":37086258030,"full_name":"Xumeng Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37291847800","id":37291847800,"full_name":"Wei Chen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37531405500","id":37531405500,"full_name":"Jiazhi Xia","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088753060","id":37088753060,"full_name":"Zexian Chen","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Information Engineering, China Jiliang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088756944","id":37088756944,"full_name":"Dongshi Xu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Information Engineering, China Jiliang University"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Graphics and Image Hangzhou Dianzi University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088749096","id":37088749096,"full_name":"Xiangyang Wu","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Graphics and Image Hangzhou Dianzi University"]}},{"affiliation":"Zhengzhou University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396970400","id":37396970400,"full_name":"Mingliang Xu","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhengzhou University"]}},{"affiliation":"Graz University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282557600","id":37282557600,"full_name":"Tobias Schreck","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Graz University of Technology"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Time-series data is widely studied in various scenarios, like weather forecast, stock market, customer behavior analysis.

However, traditional blockchain explorers mostly present transaction information in textual and tabular forms. Such forms make understanding cryptocurrency transaction mechanisms difficult for novice users (NUsers). They are also insufficiently informative for experienced users (EUsers) to recognize advanced transaction information. This study introduces a new online cryptocurrency transaction data viewing tool called SilkViser. Guided by detailed scenario and requirement analyses, we create a series of appreciating visualization designs, such as paper ledger-inspired block and blockchain visualizations and ancient copper coin-inspired transaction visualizations, to help users understand cryptocurrency transaction mechanisms and recognize advanced transaction information. We also provide a set of lightweight interactions to facilitate easy and free data exploration. Moreover, a controlled user study is conducted to quantitatively evaluate the usability and effectiveness of SilkViser. Results indicate that SilkViser can satisfy the requirements of NUsers and EUsers. Our visualization designs can compensate for the inexperience of NUsers in data viewing and attract potential users to participate in cryptocurrency

problem due to the increase of data sizes. A variety of sampling strategies have been proposed to reduce overdraw and visual clutter with the spatial densities of points taken into account. However, informative attributes associated with the points also play significant roles in the exploration of geographical datasets. In this paper, we propose an attribute-based abstraction method to simplify the cluttered visualization of large-scale geographical points. Spatial autocorrelations are utilized to measure the attribute relationships of points in local areas, and a novel attribute-based sampling model is designed to generate a subset of points to preserve both density and attribute characteristics of original geographical points. A set of visual designs and user-friendly interactions are implemented, enabling users to capture the spatial distribution of geographical points and get deeper insights into the attribute features across local areas. Case studies and quantitative comparisons based on the real-world datasets further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the abstraction and exploration of large-scale geographical point datasets.","article_number":"9308623","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9308623","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9308623/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9308623/","publication_title":"2020 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2020","publication_number":9308302,"is_number":9308614,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2020","start_page":"60","end_page":"71","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":608,"insert_date":"20210104","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Correlation","Visualization","Data visualization","Geospatial analysis","Sampling methods","Clutter","Graphical models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual Abstraction","Spatial Autocorrelation","Sampling","Geospatial Analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Spatial Autocorrelation","Geographic Data","Geographical Point","Visual Abstract","Local Area","Quantitative Comparison","Large-scale Datasets","Large-scale Data Sets","Distribution Of Points","Real-world Datasets","Real-world Data Sets","Original Point","Feature Points","Characteristic Points","Spatial Density","Visual Design","Exploration Of The Role","Subset Of Points","Exploration Of Datasets","Exploration Of Data Sets","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Spatial Distribution Of Points","Geographic Datasets","Geographic Data Sets","Ambiguity","Geospatial Analysis","Local Features","Local Characteristics","Spatial Features","Spatial Characteristics","Traditional Sampling Methods","Traditional Sampling Method","Sampling Method","Sampling Methods","Proportion Of Points","Exploratory Data","Spatial Model","Neighborhood Characteristics","Neighbourhood Characteristics","Neighborhood Features","Relative Density","Specific Gravity"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8010-6","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8009-0","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00015","title":"SMAP: A Joint Dimensionality Reduction Scheme for Secure Multi-Party Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-7281-8010-6","rank":6,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37531405500","id":37531405500,"full_name":"Jiazhi Xia","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088756851","id":37088756851,"full_name":"Tianxiang Chen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088754530","id":37088754530,"full_name":"Lei Zhang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37291847800","id":37291847800,"full_name":"Wei Chen","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"I4 data","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087502906","id":37087502906,"full_name":"Yang Chen","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["I4 data"]}},{"affiliation":"Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547462","id":37086547462,"full_name":"Xiaolong Zhang","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA"]}},{"affiliation":"Facebook","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085897527","id":37085897527,"full_name":"Cong Xie","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Facebook"]}},{"affiliation":"Graz University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282557600","id":37282557600,"full_name":"Tobias Schreck","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Graz University of Technology"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Nowadays, as data becomes increasingly complex and distributed, data analyses often involve several related datasets that are stored on different servers and probably owned by different stakeholders. While there is an emerging need to provide these stakeholders with a full picture of their data under a global context, conventional visual analytical methods, such as dimensionality reduction, could expose data privacy when multi-party datasets are fused into a single site to build point-level relationships. In this paper, we reformulate the conventional t-SNE method from the single-site mode into a secure distributed infrastructure. We present a secure multi-party scheme for joint t-SNE computation, which can minimize the risk of data leakage. Aggregated visualization can be optionally employed to hide disclosure of point-level relationships. We build a prototype system based on our method, SMAP, to support the organization, computation, and exploration of secure joint embedding. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with three case studies, one of which is based on the deployment of our system in real-world applications.","article_number":"9308625","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9308625","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9308625/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9308625/","publication_title":"2020 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2020","publication_number":9308302,"is_number":9308614,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2020","start_page":"107","end_page":"118","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":506,"insert_date":"20210104","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Dimensionality reduction","Data privacy","Task analysis","Privacy","Hospitals","Distributed databases"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["High-Dimensional Data Visualization","Secure Visualization","Dimensionality Reduction","Secure Multi-Party Computation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Dimensionality Reduction","Data Privacy","Private Information","Joint Embedding","Machine Learning","Machine-learning","Machine Learning Models","Local Data","Distance Matrix","Distance Matrices","Density Map","Data Security","Machine Learning Applications","Low-dimensional Space","Lower-dimensional Space","T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding","T-SNE","Distribution Of Participants","Shared Space","Secret Key","Private Key","Exploratory Outcomes","Exploratory Results","Encrypted Data","Collaborative Analysis","Multi-party Computation","Secure Multiparty Computation","Secure Computation","Parallel Coordinates","Dimensionality Reduction Approach","L1 Region","Distributed Machine Learning","Kind Of Role","Online System","General Data Protection Regulation","GDPR","Pairwise Distances","Public Key","Key Pair","Public-key","Data Mining","Data-mining"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8010-6","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8009-0","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00013","title":"iConViz: Interactive Visual Exploration of the Default Contagion Risk of Networked-Guarantee Loans","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-7281-8010-6","rank":7,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086385937","id":37086385937,"full_name":"Zhibin Niu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088757181","id":37088757181,"full_name":"Runlin Li","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088755733","id":37088755733,"full_name":"Junqi Wu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086385381","id":37086385381,"full_name":"Dawei Cheng","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37281468400","id":37281468400,"full_name":"Jiawan Zhang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Groups of enterprises can serve as guarantees for one another and form complex networks when obtaining loans from commercial banks. During economic slowdowns, corporate default may spread like a virus and lead to large-scale defaults or even systemic financial crises. To help financial regulatory authorities and banks manage the risk associated with networked loans, we identified the default contagion risk, a pivotal issue in developing preventive measures, and established iConViz, an interactive visual analysis tool that facilitates the closed-loop analysis process. A novel financial metric, the contagion effect, was formulated to quantify the infectious consequences of guarantee chains in this type of network. Based on this metric, we designed and implemented a series of novel and coordinated views that address the analysis of financial problems. Experts evaluated the system using real-world financial data. The proposed approach grants practitioners the ability to avoid previous ad hoc analysis methodologies and extend coverage of the conventional Capital Accord to the banking industry.","article_number":"9308622","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9308622","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9308622/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9308622/","publication_title":"2020 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2020","publication_number":9308302,"is_number":9308614,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2020","start_page":"84","end_page":"94","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":393,"insert_date":"20210104","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visual analytics","Risk management","Banking","Monitoring","Tools","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization analytics","Regulatory visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Risk Of Contagion","Default Contagion","Complex Network","Visual Analysis","Real-world Data","Visualization Tool","Interactive Tool","Commercial Banks","Contagion Effect","Years Of Experience","Risk Management","Visual System","Visual Network","Network Diagram","Risk Measures","Systemic Risk","Mutation Patterns","Financial Stability","Financial Information","European Central Bank","European Bank","Visual Design","Networks Of Interest","Type Of Business","Financial Expertise","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Expert Users","Different Levels Of Detail","Fraud Detection","Risk Management System","Main View"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8010-6","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8009-0","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00010","title":"A Visual Analytics Framework for Contrastive Network Analysis","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-7281-8010-6","rank":8,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086133964","id":37086133964,"full_name":"Takanori Fujiwara","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Waterloo","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38024987300","id":38024987300,"full_name":"Jian Zhao","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Waterloo"]}},{"affiliation":"FX Palo Alto Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349925200","id":37349925200,"full_name":"Francine Chen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["FX Palo Alto Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275869400","id":37275869400,"full_name":"Kwan-Liu Ma","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"A common network analysis task is comparison of two networks to identify unique characteristics in one network with respect to the other. For example, when comparing protein interaction networks derived from normal and cancer tissues, one essential task is to discover protein-protein interactions unique to cancer tissues. However, this task is challenging when the networks contain complex structural (and semantic) relations. To address this problem, we design ContraNA, a visual analytics framework leveraging both the power of machine learning for uncovering unique characteristics in networks and also the effectiveness of visualization for understanding such uniqueness. The basis of ContraNA is cNRL, which integrates two machine learning schemes, network representation learning (NRL) and contrastive learning (CL), to generate a low-dimensional embedding that reveals the uniqueness of one network when compared to another. ContraNA provides an interactive visualization interface to help analyze the uniqueness by relating embedding results and network structures as well as explaining the learned features by cNRL. We demonstrate the usefulness of ContraNA with two case studies using real-world datasets. We also evaluate ContraNA through a controlled user study with 12 participants on network comparison tasks. The results show that participants were able to both effectively identify unique characteristics from complex networks and interpret the results obtained from cNRL.","article_number":"9308624","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9308624","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9308624/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9308624/","publication_title":"2020 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2020","publication_number":9308302,"is_number":9308614,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2020","start_page":"48","end_page":"59","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":602,"insert_date":"20210104","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Task analysis","Semantics","Computer architecture","Two dimensional displays","Proteins","Principal component analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Contrastive learning","network representation learning","interpretability","network comparison","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Network Analysis","Visual Analytics Framework","Unique Features","Unique Characteristics","Protein-protein Interaction Network","Protein Interaction Network","Network Characteristics","Network Features","Representation Learning","Analysis Tasks","Interactive Visualization","Self-supervised Learning","Contrastive Learning","Network Comparison","Comparative Network","Machine Learning Strategies","Machine Learning Scheme","Visual Interface","Visual Framework","Comparative Analysis","Comparison Analysis","Feature Values","Characteristic Values","Dynamic Network","Brain Networks","Visual Comparison","Latent Space","Embedding Space","Target Network","Background Network","Eigenvector Centrality","P2P Network","Peer-to-peer Network","Pricing Model","Asset Pricing Model","Contrast Analysis","Interpretation Of Features","Interpretation Of Characteristics","Contribution Of Features","Contribution Of Characteristics","Contribution Of Each Feature","Real-world Networks","Target Dataset","Target Data Set"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8010-6","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8009-0","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00012","title":"STULL: Unbiased Online Sampling for Visual Exploration of Large Spatiotemporal Data","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-7281-8010-6","rank":9,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085630335","id":37085630335,"full_name":"Guizhen Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086453815","id":37086453815,"full_name":"Jingjing Guo","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University"]}},{"affiliation":"Chinese Academy of Science","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085575857","id":37085575857,"full_name":"Mingjie Tang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Chinese Academy of Science"]}},{"affiliation":"Federal University of Ceara","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088749543","id":37088749543,"full_name":"José Florencio de Queiroz Neto","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Federal University of Ceara"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086096590","id":37086096590,"full_name":"Calvin Yau","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University"]}},{"affiliation":"Umm Al-Qura University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085393243","id":37085393243,"full_name":"Anas Daghistani","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Umm Al-Qura University"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Colorado Boulder","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089053323","id":37089053323,"full_name":"Morteza Karimzadeh","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Colorado Boulder"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37276656400","id":37276656400,"full_name":"Walid G.

However, existing online spatiotemporal sampling techniques are often biased, as most researchers have primarily focused on reducing computational latency. Biased sampling approaches select data with unequal probabilities and produce results that do not match the exact data distribution, leading end users to incorrect interpretations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to perform unbiased online sampling of large spatiotemporal data. The proposed approach ensures the same probability of selection to every point that qualifies the specifications of a user's multidimensional query. To achieve unbiased sampling for accurate representative interactive visualizations, we design a novel data index and an associated sample retrieval plan. Our proposed sampling approach is suitable for a wide variety of visual analytics tasks, e.g., tasks that run aggregate queries of spatiotemporal data. Extensive experiments confirm the superiority of our approach over a state-of-the-art spatial online sampling technique, demonstrating that within the same computational time, data samples generated in our approach are at least 50% more accurate in representing the actual spatial distribution of the data and enable approximate visualizations to present closer visual appearances to the exact ones.","article_number":"9308629","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9308629","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9308629/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9308629/","publication_title":"2020 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2020","publication_number":9308302,"is_number":9308614,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2020","start_page":"72","end_page":"83","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":311,"insert_date":"20210104","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Visual analytics","Indexes","Task analysis","Spatial databases","Time factors"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Geospatial data","large-scale data techniques","data management","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Exploratory Data","Spatiotemporal Data","Online Sample","Unbiased Sampling","Large Spatio-temporal Data","Sampling Bias","Ascertainment Bias","Sampling Biases","Sample Selection Bias","Visual Analysis","Sampling Approach","Spatial Sampling","Unequal Probabilities","Computation Latency","Root Mean Square Error","Root-mean-square Deviation","Root-mean-square Error","RMSD","RMSE","Sample Buffer","Percentage Points","Data Streams","Percentage Of Data","Unbiased Approach","Leaf Cells","Spatial Range","Spatial Index","Spatial Indices","Exact Answer","Incremental Update","Circular Array","Pyramid Level","Bottom Level","Multiple Bins","Retrieval Time","Numerical Accuracy","Retrieval Procedure","Accurate Answers"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8010-6","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8009-0","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00008","title":"A Visual Analytics Approach to Debugging Cooperative, Autonomous Multi-Robot Systems’ Worldviews","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-7281-8010-6","rank":10,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088641213","id":37088641213,"full_name":"Suyun “Sandra” Bae","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis"]}},{"affiliation":"Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085471827","id":37085471827,"full_name":"Federico Rossi","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073898100","id":37073898100,"full_name":"Joshua Vander Hook","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085452753","id":37085452753,"full_name":"Scott Davidoff","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275869400","id":37275869400,"full_name":"Kwan-Liu Ma","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Autonomous multi-robot systems, where a team of robots shares information to perform tasks that are beyond an individual robot's abilities, hold great promise for a number of applications, such as planetary exploration missions. Each robot in a multi-robot system that uses the shared-world coordination paradigm autonomously schedules which robot should perform a given task, and when, using its worldview-the robot's internal representation of its belief about both its own state, and other robots' states. A key problem for operators is that robots' worldviews can fall out of sync (often due to weak communication links), leading to desynchronization of the robots' scheduling decisions and inconsistent emergent behavior (e.g., tasks not performed, or performed by multiple robots). Operators face the time-consuming and difficult task of making sense of the robots' scheduling decisions, detecting de-synchronizations, and pinpointing the cause by comparing every robot's worldview. To address these challenges, we introduce MOSAIC Viewer, a visual analytics system that helps operators (i) make sense of the robots' schedules and (ii) detect and conduct a root cause analysis of the robots' desynchronized worldviews. Over a year-long partnership with roboticists at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, we conduct a formative study to identify the necessary system design requirements and a qualitative evaluation with 12 roboticists. We find that MOSAIC Viewer is faster- and easier-to-use than the users' current approaches, and it allows them to stitch low-level details to formulate a high-level understanding of the robots' schedules and detect and pinpoint the cause of the desynchronized worldviews.","article_number":"9308630","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9308630","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9308630/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9308630/","publication_title":"2020 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2020","publication_number":9308302,"is_number":9308614,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2020","start_page":"24","end_page":"35","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":392,"insert_date":"20210104","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Task analysis","Robots","Robot kinematics","Tools","Debugging","Navigation","Multi-robot systems"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Multi-Robot Systems","Human-Subjects Qualitative Studies","Debugging","I.3.8 [Computer Graphics]","Applications"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Worldview","Visual Analysis","Multi-agent Systems","Debugging","Communication Links","Scheduling Decisions","Inconsistent Behavior","Inconsistent Behaviour","Communication Network","Visual Representation","User Study","Base Station","Information In Order","Domain Experts","Detailed View","Similar Views","Navigation Task","Exit Interviews","Communication Bandwidth","Scientific Tasks","Constant Communication","Battery Level","Main View","Different Sets Of Assumptions","Visual Encoding","Visual Analytics Tool","Precedence Constraints","Visual Odometry","Bandwidth Values","Interactive","Robotics Research"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8010-6","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8009-0","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00005","title":"Preface to IEEE VAST 2020 Conference Track and VAST Challenge","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-7281-8010-6","rank":11,"authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Presents the introductory welcome message from the conference proceedings.
