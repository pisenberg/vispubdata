An inexpensive, straightforward method is discussed for reducing the number of elements searched for such isovalues. It takes advantage of one traversal of the element data to yield a compact classification of the model by result values and ranges, with no sorting required. This data structure can then relate any scalar isovalue to a set of element groups which are closely inclusive of the isovalue. This method is intended for applications requiring repeated access to the analysis data, such as animation and interactive rendering of isosurfaces and scalar fields.

By viewing these components separately, it is difficult for MR practitioners to conceptualize and comprehend the underlying flow structures, especially when the image data have strong background noise. A flow visualization technique that adapts the idea of particle tracing used in classical fluid dynamics for visualizing flow is presented. The flow image processing relies on the strong correlation between the principal flow direction estimated from the distribution of the modulus of the velocity field and the direction derived from the raw image data. By correlation calculation, severe background noise can be eliminated. Flow pattern rendering and animation provide an efficient way for representing internal flow structures.<>","article_number":"175801","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=175801","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/175801/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/175801/","publication_title":"Proceeding Visualization '91","conference_location":"San Diego, CA, USA","conference_dates":"22-25 Oct. 1991","publication_number":362,"is_number":4467,"publication_year":1991,"publication_date":"22-25 Oct. 1991","start_page":"202","end_page":"209","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":3,"download_count":81,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["In vivo","Blood flow","Magnetic resonance imaging","Background noise","Data visualization","Magnetic resonance","Image coding","Fluid dynamics","Image processing","Rendering (computer graphics)"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-2245-8","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1991.175833","title":"Advanced visualization on desktop workstations","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-2245-8","rank":16,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Intelligent Light, Fair Lawn, NJ, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37563084100","id":37563084100,"full_name":"S.M.

Historically, scientific visualization has been carried out in two primary modes: interactive on desktop computers, and batch on high-performance computers.

This network effectively unites desktop computers with higher-value remote resources into a single metacomputer. To take advantage of this new hardware configuration, distributed visualization software is being developed which allows the flexibility of the local workstation to be coupled with the computing power of distant supercomputers.

The topology of v considered consists of its critical points (where v=0), their invariant manifolds, and the integral curves connecting these invariant manifolds. The field in the neighborhood of each critical point is approximated by the Taylor expansion. The coefficients of the first nonzero term of the Taylor expansion around a critical point are the 3*3 matrix Delta v. Critical points are classified by examining Delta v's eigenvalues. The eigenvectors of Delta v span the invariant manifolds of the linearized field around a critical point. Curves integrated from initial points on the eigenvectors a small distance from a critical point connect with other critical points (or the boundary) to complete the topology.

In particular, for silicon computations it is found that volumetric visualization of the computed 3D electronic charge density is a valuable tool for identifying defect states in silicon lattices in which oxygen atoms occur as impurities. Rendering of several judiciously selected ranges of charge density in translucent colors provides an effective means of identifying broken or altered molecular bonds and induced charge excesses in the lattice. The resulting 3D images reveal important features missed previously in 2D charge density contour maps. Stereoscopic 'blink comparison' of image pairs is an extremely valuable way to study the structural differences among various configurations, and animation provides significant insight into the molecular dynamics.<>","article_number":"175786","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=175786","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/175786/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/175786/","publication_title":"Proceeding Visualization '91","conference_location":"San Diego, CA, USA","conference_dates":"22-25 Oct. 1991","publication_number":362,"is_number":4467,"publication_year":1991,"publication_date":"22-25 Oct. 1991","start_page":"109","end_page":"115","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":64,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Oxygen","Silicon","Data visualization","Physics computing","Optical surface waves","Surface morphology","Clouds","Quantum computing","Lattices","Quantum mechanics"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-2245-8","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1991.175781","title":"Visualization of equations in an interactive environment","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-2245-8","rank":54,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"IBM European Visualization Centre, Winchester, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38224624000","id":38224624000,"full_name":"D.

A computer graphics simulation that enhances the viewer's perception of these features using shaded polygonal models of the actual golf green used in tournaments is presented. Mathematical modeling of the golf ball's trajectory on its way toward the hole further enhances viewer understanding. A putting difficulty map assesses the relative difficulty of putting from each location on the green to a given pin position. The object-oriented system is written in C and runs on a variety of 3D graphics workstations. As an experiment, the system was used at a professional golf tournament and correctly simulated all putts during the final round.<>","article_number":"175787","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=175787","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/175787/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/175787/","publication_title":"Proceeding Visualization '91","conference_location":"San Diego, CA, USA","conference_dates":"22-25 Oct. 1991","publication_number":362,"is_number":4467,"publication_year":1991,"publication_date":"22-25 Oct. 1991","start_page":"116","end_page":"123","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":3,"download_count":97,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Cameras","Object oriented modeling","Surfaces","Computer graphics","TV","Horses","Sun","Research and development","Computational modeling"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-2245-8","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1991.175791","title":"Gray scale diagrams as business charts","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-2245-8","rank":56,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Infomation and Decision Systems Department, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087340203","id":37087340203,"full_name":"W.R.
