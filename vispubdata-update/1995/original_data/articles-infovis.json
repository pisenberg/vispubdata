The need is driven by the growing number of domains where there is a requirement for users to understand, navigate and manipulate large sets of computer based data; by the increasing size and complexity of this information and by the pressures to use this information efficiently. The paradigmatic example is the World Wide Web, but other domains include software systems, information systems and concurrent engineering. One approach to providing this support is to provide sophisticated visualisation tools which lead the users to form an intuitive understanding of the structure and behaviour of their domain and which provide mechanisms which allow them to manipulate objects within their system.

The traditional node and link network displays work well for small datasets but become visually cluttered and uninterpretable for large datasets. A natural 3D metaphor for displaying world-wide network data is to position the nodes on a globe and draw arcs between them coding the traffic. This technique has several advantages of over the traditional 2D displays, it naturally reduces line crossing clutter, provides an intuitive model for navigation and indication of time, and retains the geographic context. Coupling these strengths with some novel interaction techniques involving the globe surface translucency and arc heights illustrates the usefulness for this class of displays.","article_number":"528697","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=528697","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/528697/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/528697/","publication_title":"Proceedings of Visualization 1995 Conference","conference_location":"Atlanta, GA, USA","conference_dates":"30-31 Oct. 1995","publication_number":4050,"is_number":11604,"publication_year":1995,"publication_date":"30-31 Oct. 1995","start_page":"129","end_page":"131","citing_paper_count":14,"citing_patent_count":2,"download_count":195,"insert_date":"20090106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three dimensional displays","Internet","Telecommunication traffic","Explosives","IP networks","Data visualization","Traffic control","Two dimensional displays","Context modeling","Navigation"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7201-3","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.1995.528680","title":"Visualisation for functional design","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-7201-3","partnum":"95TB100000","rank":4,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Electrical Engineering Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, London, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087575231","id":37087575231,"full_name":"B.

Our approach is user-centric-taking users needs into account by allowing them to interact with the information contained in large arrays of documents. The visualization process is an integral part of the overall process. We have covered three related categories in this methodology. The first one is browsing through the World-Wide Web (WWW) hyperspace without becoming lost, based on a visual representation of the hyperspace hierarchical structure (hyperspace view). The second category is overcoming the rigidity of the WWW by allowing the user to construct interactively and visually a personal hyperspace of information, linking the documents according to the application or problem domain, or to the user's own perception, experience, culture, or way of thinking. The third category includes discovery and analysis of new information and relationships in retrieved documents by aggregating relevant information and representing it visually.","article_number":"528696","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=528696","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/528696/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/528696/","publication_title":"Proceedings of Visualization 1995 Conference","conference_location":"Atlanta, GA, USA","conference_dates":"30-31 Oct. 1995","publication_number":4050,"is_number":11604,"publication_year":1995,"publication_date":"30-31 Oct. 1995","start_page":"122","end_page":"128","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":5,"download_count":121,"insert_date":"20090106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Internet","Information analysis","World Wide Web","Information resources","Joining processes","Information retrieval"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7201-3","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.1995.528693","title":"Case study: fishing for information on the Internet","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-7201-3","partnum":"95TB100000","rank":6,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"MITRE Corporation, Bedford, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37341386400","id":37341386400,"full_name":"R.

Search tools exist that allow users to find relevant information. However, a search can often produce such a large amount of data that it becomes hard to ferret out the most appropriate and highest quality information. In addition, some search tools lose valuable information when displaying the results to the user. The paper describes a search visualization tool, called FISH, for viewing hierarchically structured information and managing information overload. FISH (Forager for the Information Super Highway) allows users to visualize the results of search requests across large document spaces in a way that preserves the structure of the information space. FISH displays the returned documents as rectangles, using a combination of order, indentation, size, and color to denote document hierarchy, the score of the documents with respect to the search, and other data attributes. In addition, the user can navigate through the document space for in-depth probing and refinement.","article_number":"528693","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=528693","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/528693/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/528693/","publication_title":"Proceedings of Visualization 1995 Conference","conference_location":"Atlanta, GA, USA","conference_dates":"30-31 Oct. 1995","publication_number":4050,"is_number":11604,"publication_year":1995,"publication_date":"30-31 Oct. 1995","start_page":"105","end_page":"111","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":3,"download_count":96,"insert_date":"20090106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Internet","Marine animals","Data visualization","Information management","Road transportation","Displays","Navigation"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7201-3","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.1995.528683","title":"Research report: improving browsing in information by the automatic display layout","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-7201-3","partnum":"95TB100000","rank":7,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Technische Universitäat Braunschweig, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087570760","id":37087570760,"full_name":"P.

But this promising approach requires the capability of an automatic layout system because the tedious and time consuming task of a manual layout leads to a rejection of this approach by the user. In our approach, we split the task of retrieving information into two phases that are getting the orientation within the network and reading currently visited information. We present layout algorithms for both phases which have the benefit of being flexible and adaptable to individual user requests and ensure the topological consistency, i.e. the stability of the topology of the information layout during a sequence of display layouts. The results show that especially the possibility of an animation of the layout process can assist the user essentially in maintaining the orientation in the information network.","article_number":"528683","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=528683","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/528683/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/528683/","publication_title":"Proceedings of Visualization 1995 Conference","conference_location":"Atlanta, GA, USA","conference_dates":"30-31 Oct. 1995","publication_number":4050,"is_number":11604,"publication_year":1995,"publication_date":"30-31 Oct. 1995","start_page":"26","end_page":"33","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":2,"download_count":111,"insert_date":"20090106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Displays","Layout","Information retrieval","Stability","Network topology","Animation"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7201-3","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.1995.528687","title":"VRMosaic: WEB access from within a virtual environment","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-7201-3","partnum":"95TB100000","rank":8,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Boeing Information and Support Services, Seattle, WA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37352263600","id":37352263600,"full_name":"I.G.

But before VR can realize this potential, we need to solve a number of problems. One of these problems: the user's need to see and interact with non-geometric information is examined. Our VR environment, RealEyes, can display large-scale and detailed geometry at reasonable frame rates (>20 Hz) allowing a user to see and navigate within a design from a first person perspective. However, much (if not most) of the information associated with a particular design has no geometric representation. This includes information such as schematics of electrical, hydraulic, and plumbing systems; information describing materials or processes; and descriptive (textual) information of other types. Many researchers have developed a wealth of techniques for presenting such data on flat-screen displays, but until recently, we have not had a means for naturally displaying such information within a VR environment. To make non-geometric data more available, we have implemented a version of Mosaic that functions within a fully immersive VR system. Our system, VRMosaic, allows a user of VR to access and display most of the data available using flat screen Mosaic. Moreover, we have made it extensible to allow for the seamless integration of specialized forms of data and interaction. This paper describes how we implemented VRMosaic using a VR-capable version of Interviews, It also describes some Mosaic-like uses of that system and some \"non-Mosaic-like\" extensions.","article_number":"528687","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=528687","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/528687/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/528687/","publication_title":"Proceedings of Visualization 1995 Conference","conference_location":"Atlanta, GA, USA","conference_dates":"30-31 Oct. 1995","publication_number":4050,"is_number":11604,"publication_year":1995,"publication_date":"30-31 Oct. 1995","start_page":"59","end_page":"64","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":135,"insert_date":"20090106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Virtual environment","Virtual reality","Displays","Marine vehicles","Production facilities","Aircraft","Large-scale systems","Geometry","Navigation"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7201-3","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.1995.528694","title":"Case study.

The application arena is large text document corpora such as digital libraries, regulations and procedures, archived reports, etc. The basic idea is that text content from these sources may be transformed to a spatial representation that preserves informational characteristics from the documents. The spatial representation may then be visually browsed and analyzed in ways that avoid language processing and that reduce the analysts mental workload. The result is an interaction with text that more nearly resembles perception and action with the natural world than with the abstractions of written language.","article_number":"528686","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=528686","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/528686/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/528686/","publication_title":"Proceedings of Visualization 1995 Conference","conference_location":"Atlanta, GA, USA","conference_dates":"30-31 Oct. 1995","publication_number":4050,"is_number":11604,"publication_year":1995,"publication_date":"30-31 Oct. 1995","start_page":"51","end_page":"58","citing_paper_count":233,"citing_patent_count":13,"download_count":2576,"insert_date":"20090106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Information analysis","Software libraries"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7201-3","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.1995.528688","title":"IVEE: an Information Visualization and Exploration Environment","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-7201-3","partnum":"95TB100000","rank":11,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and SSKKII, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37352198300","id":37352198300,"full_name":"C.

Arbitrary graphical objects can be attached to database objects in visualizations. Multiple visualizations may be active simultaneously. Users can interactively lay out and change between types of query devices. Users may retrieve details-on-demand by clicking on visualization objects. An HTML file may be provided along with the database, specifying how details-on-demand information should be presented, allowing for presentation of multimedia information in database objects.

Existing systems for visualizing huge hierarchies using cone trees \"break down\" once the hierarchy to be displayed exceeds roughly 1000 nodes, due to increasing visual clutter. The paper describes a system called fsviz which visualizes arbitrarily large hierarchies while retaining user control. This is accomplished by augmenting cone trees with several graphical and interaction techniques: usage-based filtering, animated zooming, hand-coupled rotation, fish-eye zooming, coalescing of distant nodes, texturing, effective use of colour for depth cueing, and the applications of dynamic queries. The fsviz system also improves upon earlier cone tree visualization systems through a more elaborate node layout algorithm. This algorithm enhances the usefulness of cone tree visualization for large hierarchies by all but eliminating clutter.","article_number":"528689","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=528689","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/528689/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/528689/","publication_title":"Proceedings of Visualization 1995 Conference","conference_location":"Atlanta, GA, USA","conference_dates":"30-31 Oct. 1995","publication_number":4050,"is_number":11604,"publication_year":1995,"publication_date":"30-31 Oct. 1995","start_page":"74","end_page":"81","citing_paper_count":33,"citing_patent_count":17,"download_count":277,"insert_date":"20090106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Tree graphs","Control systems","Filtering","Animation","Layout"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7201-3","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.1995.528685","title":"The information mural: a technique for displaying and navigating large information spaces","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-7201-3","partnum":"95TB100000","rank":13,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Usability Center, College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37352201100","id":37352201100,"full_name":"D.F.

We have developed a technique for displaying and navigating large information spaces. The key concept is the use of an information mural, a two-dimensional reduced representation of an entire information space that fits completely within a display window or screen. Information murals use grayscale shading and color along with anti-aliasing techniques to create a miniature version of the entire data set. By incorporating navigational capabilities, information murals become a tool that can be used as a global view along with more detailed informational displays. Information murals are utilized in our software visualization research to help depict the execution of object-oriented programs, and can also be used in more general information visualization applications.","article_number":"528685","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=528685","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/528685/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/528685/","publication_title":"Proceedings of Visualization 1995 Conference","conference_location":"Atlanta, GA, USA","conference_dates":"30-31 Oct. 1995","publication_number":4050,"is_number":11604,"publication_year":1995,"publication_date":"30-31 Oct. 1995","start_page":"43","end_page":"50","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":3,"download_count":150,"insert_date":"20090106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Navigation","Large screen displays","Two dimensional displays","Gray-scale","Data visualization","Application software"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7201-3","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.1995.528682","title":"Research report: information animation applications in the capital markets","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-7201-3","partnum":"95TB100000","rank":14,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Visible Decisions, Inc., Toronto, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089093283","id":37089093283,"full_name":"W.

By using motion and animated interaction, it is possible to use 3D as a reliable, accurate and precise decision-support tool. Information animation applications are particularly suited to the securities industry because that is where we find huge amounts of data, the value of which declines rapidly with time, and where critical decisions are being made on this data in very short periods of time. Information animation technology is an important new tool for the securities industry, where people need to be in the decision-making loop without suffering from information overload.
