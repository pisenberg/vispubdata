The objective in these cases is to render the layered surfaces in a such way that the outer structures can be seen and seen through at the same time. The paper focuses on the particular application of radiation therapy treatment planning, in which physicians need to understand the three dimensional distribution of radiation dose in the context of patient anatomy. We describe a promising technique for communicating the shape and position of the transparent skin surface while at the same time minimally occluding underlying isointensity dose surfaces and anatomical objects: adding a sparse, opaque texture comprised of a small set of carefully chosen lines. We explain the perceptual motivation for explicitly drawing ridge and valley curves on a transparent surface, describe straightforward mathematical techniques for detecting and rendering these lines, and propose a small number of reasonably effective methods for selectively emphasizing the most perceptually relevant lines in the display.","article_number":"480795","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=480795","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480795/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480795/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '95","conference_location":"Atlanta, GA, USA","conference_dates":"29 Oct.-3 Nov. 1995","publication_number":3467,"is_number":10213,"publication_year":1995,"publication_date":"29 Oct.-3 Nov. 1995","start_page":"52","end_page":"59","citing_paper_count":63,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":152,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Skin","Shape","Surface treatment","Medical treatment","Three dimensional displays","Computer displays","Biomedical applications of radiation","Anatomy","Surface texture","Anatomical structure"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7187-4","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1995.480817","title":"Enhanced spot noise for vector field visualization","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-7187-4","issn":"1070-2385","partnum":"95CB35835","rank":4,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Faculty of Technical Mathematics and Informatics, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37327212900","id":37327212900,"full_name":"W.C. de Leeuw","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Faculty of Technical Mathematics and Informatics, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"]}},{"affiliation":"ECN, Netherlands Energy Research Foundation (ECN), Petten, Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267249200","id":37267249200,"full_name":"J.J. van Wijk","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["ECN, Netherlands Energy Research Foundation (ECN), Petten, Netherlands"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Spot noise is a technique for texture synthesis, which is very useful for vector field visualization.

Second, filtering of spots is proposed to eliminate undesired low frequency components from the spot noise texture. Third, methods are described to utilize graphics hardware to generate the texture, and to produce variable viewpoint animations of spot noise on surfaces.

This technique imposes considerable demands on storage space as the data set grows in size. In this paper, we describe a method to render compressed volume data directly to reduce the memory requirements of the rendering process. The volume data was compressed by a technique called the Laplacian pyramid. A compression ratio of 10:1 was achieved by uniform quantization over the Laplacian pyramid. The quality of the images obtained by this technique as virtually indistinguishable from that of the images generated from the uncompressed volume data. A significant improvement in computational performance was achieved by using a cache algorithm to temporarily retain the reconstructed voxels to be used by the adjacent rays.","article_number":"480812","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=480812","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480812/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480812/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '95","conference_location":"Atlanta, GA, USA","conference_dates":"29 Oct.-3 Nov. 1995","publication_number":3467,"is_number":10213,"publication_year":1995,"publication_date":"29 Oct.-3 Nov. 1995","start_page":"192","end_page":"199","citing_paper_count":23,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":100,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Laplace equations","Rendering (computer graphics)","Image coding","Data visualization","Image reconstruction","Computed tomography","Computer science","Workstations","Image generation","Quantization"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7187-4","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1995.485142","title":"Voxel based object simplification","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-7187-4","issn":"1070-2385","partnum":"95CB35835","rank":7,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, State University of New York, Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087447193","id":37087447193,"full_name":"Taosong He","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, State University of New York, Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, State University of New York, Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086999546","id":37086999546,"full_name":"Lichan Hong","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, State University of New York, Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, State University of New York, Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268052800","id":37268052800,"full_name":"A.

We apply the unsteady flow volumes to a variety of field types, including moving multi-zoned curvilinear grids.","article_number":"485146","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=485146","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/485146/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/485146/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '95","conference_location":"Atlanta, GA, USA","conference_dates":"29 Oct.-3 Nov. 1995","publication_number":3467,"is_number":10213,"publication_year":1995,"publication_date":"29 Oct.-3 Nov. 1995","start_page":"329","end_page":"335","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":87,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Fluid flow measurement","Scientific visualization","Image generation"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7187-4","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1995.485144","title":"Fast Algorithms for Visualizing Fluid Motion in Steady Flow on Unstructured Grids","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-7187-4","issn":"1070-2385","partnum":"95CB35835","rank":12,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of Utah, Salt Lake, UT, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089138088","id":37089138088,"full_name":"S.K.

However, as is often the case in other manufacturing processes, diecastings are currently designed purely based on their function. The manufacturability of the diecastings is not considered until the design has been nearly completed and detailed. This is due to the design support limitations of current CAE tools. We present a new volume-based approach to support diecastability evaluation, especially in preliminary design. Our approach can be applied to arbitrarily shaped parts without pre-defined feature libraries. The focus is on the identification of geometric characteristics, e.g. heavy mass regions, that could be responsible for thermal-related part defects. A distance transform with city-block metric is used to extract this geometric property. Volume visualization techniques are also adopted to allow users to visualize the results in a clear and precise way.","article_number":"485152","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=485152","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/485152/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/485152/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '95","conference_location":"Atlanta, GA, USA","conference_dates":"29 Oct.-3 Nov. 1995","publication_number":3467,"is_number":10213,"publication_year":1995,"publication_date":"29 Oct.-3 Nov. 1995","start_page":"359","end_page":"362","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":53,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Die casting","Manufacturing processes","Computer aided manufacturing","Computational geometry","Information geometry","Design for manufacture","Data mining","Design automation","Solid modeling"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7187-4","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1995.485151","title":"Visualization of high speed aerodynamic configuration design","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-7187-4","issn":"1070-2385","partnum":"95CB35835","rank":18,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"German Aerospace Research Establishment (DLR), Gottingen, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087694164","id":37087694164,"full_name":"M.

Minimal area triangulations are used to guide the surface construction, and the final surface reflects the optimality of the triangulation. The resulting surface differs from the initial triangulation in two important ways: it is smooth (as opposed to the piecewise planar triangulation), and it is in tensor product form (as opposed to the irregular triangular mesh). The surface reconstruction is efficient because we do not require an exact minimal surface. The triangulations are used as strong hints, but no more than that. The method requires the computation of both open and closed isoparametric curves of the surface, using triangulations as a guide. These isoparametric curves form a tensor product Bezier surface. We show how to control sampling density by filling and pruning isoparametric curves, for accuracy and economy. A rectangular grid of points is produced that is compatible with the expected format for a tensor product surface interpolation, so that a host of well-supported methods are available to generate and manipulate the surface.","article_number":"480820","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=480820","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480820/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480820/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '95","conference_location":"Atlanta, GA, USA","conference_dates":"29 Oct.-3 Nov. 1995","publication_number":3467,"is_number":10213,"publication_year":1995,"publication_date":"29 Oct.-3 Nov. 1995","start_page":"254","end_page":"261","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":82,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Tensile stress","Surface reconstruction","Image reconstruction","Surface fitting","Shape","Piecewise linear approximation","Sampling methods","Interpolation","Mesh generation","Data visualization"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7187-4","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1995.485148","title":"Qualitative analysis of invariant tori in a dynamical system","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-7187-4","issn":"1070-2385","partnum":"95CB35835","rank":20,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Computing Science, Simon Frazer University, Burnaby, BC, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37326146700","id":37326146700,"full_name":"D.H.

One such technique, particle tracing, enables a dynamic (Lagrangian) interpretation of a statically (Eulerian) computed vector field. However, quite often the emphasis in particle tracing is only on the mean flow properties, while effects due to dispersion and mixing are often not accounted for. Hence turbulent flow characteristics have to be incorporated in a visualization system for practical hydraulic engineering problems. The particle tracing technique presented in this case study has been specifically developed to combine both mean and fluctuating velocity vectors, thus simulating stochastic perturbations around mean flow conditions. A number of cases are presented that demonstrate the practical applicability of advanced visualization techniques in realistic engineering studies.","article_number":"485158","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=485158","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/485158/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/485158/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '95","conference_location":"Atlanta, GA, USA","conference_dates":"29 Oct.-3 Nov. 1995","publication_number":3467,"is_number":10213,"publication_year":1995,"publication_date":"29 Oct.-3 Nov. 1995","start_page":"388","end_page":"391","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":133,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Computational fluid dynamics","Computational modeling","Numerical simulation","Fluid dynamics","Rivers","Biological system modeling","Costs","Research and development","Informatics"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7187-4","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1995.485153","title":"A visualization tool for studying the development of the moss Physcomitrella patens","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-7187-4","issn":"1070-2385","partnum":"95CB35835","rank":22,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School OF Computing Science, Simon Frazer University, Burnaby, BC, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37611726800","id":37611726800,"full_name":"F.D.

Volume data does not holds the geometric information for the surface comprising points, so it is necessary to calculate normals using local information at each point. The existing normal estimation methods have some problems of estimating incorrect normals at discontinuous, aliased or noisy points. Yagel et al. (1992) solved some of these problems using their context-sensitive method. However, this method requires too much processing time and it loses some information on detailed parts of the object surfaces. This paper proposes the surface-characteristic-sensitive normal estimation method which applies different operators according to characteristics of each surface for the normal calculation. This method has the same advantages of the context-sensitive method, and also some other advantages such as less processing time and the reduction of the information loss on detailed parts.","article_number":"480808","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=480808","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480808/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480808/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '95","conference_location":"Atlanta, GA, USA","conference_dates":"29 Oct.-3 Nov. 1995","publication_number":3467,"is_number":10213,"publication_year":1995,"publication_date":"29 Oct.-3 Nov. 1995","start_page":"159","end_page":"166","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":74,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Computed tomography","Magnetic resonance imaging","Computational modeling","Medical simulation","Humans","Data engineering","Sampling methods","Computer graphics","Biomedical imaging"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7187-4","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1995.485147","title":"Propositional n-traces: visualizing a problem in philosophical logic","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-7187-4","issn":"1070-2385","partnum":"95CB35835","rank":28,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Philosophy, Simon Frazer University, Burnaby, BC, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088205279","id":37088205279,"full_name":"N.

In this paper, we propose a new visualization technique called a 'recursive pattern', which has been developed for visualizing large amounts of multidimensional data. The technique is based on a generic recursive scheme which generalizes a wide range of pixel-oriented arrangements for displaying large data sets. By instantiating the technique with adequate data- and application-dependent parameters, the user may greatly influence the structure of the resulting visualizations. Since the technique uses one pixel for presenting each data value, the amount of data which can be displayed is only limited by the resolution of current display technology and by the limitations of human perceptibility. Beside describing the basic idea of the 'recursive pattern' technique, we provide several examples of useful parameter settings for the various recursion levels. We further show that our 'recursive pattern' technique is particularly advantageous for the large class of data sets which have a natural order according to one dimension (e.g. time series data). We demonstrate the usefulness of our technique by using a stock market application.","article_number":"485140","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=485140","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/485140/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/485140/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '95","conference_location":"Atlanta, GA, USA","conference_dates":"29 Oct.-3 Nov. 1995","publication_number":3467,"is_number":10213,"publication_year":1995,"publication_date":"29 Oct.-3 Nov. 1995","start_page":"279","end_page":"286","citing_paper_count":83,"citing_patent_count":5,"download_count":451,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Humans","Multidimensional systems","Computer science","Pattern analysis","Displays","Stock markets","Visual databases","Decision making","Automation"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7187-4","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1995.485141","title":"Iconic techniques for feature visualization","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-7187-4","issn":"1070-2385","partnum":"95CB35835","rank":33,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Faculty of Technical Mathematics and Informatics, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37353471800","id":37353471800,"full_name":"F.J.

These estimates are determined by a wavelet representation of the surface data. The basic idea is to decompose the initial data set by means of an orthogonal or semi-orthogonal tensor product wavelet transform (WT) and to analyze the resulting coefficients. In surface regions where the partial energy of the resulting coefficients is low, the polygonal approximation of the surface can be performed with larger triangles without losing too much fine-grain detail. However, since the localization of the WT is bound by the Heisenberg principle, the meshing method has to be controlled by the detail signals rather than directly by the coefficients. The dyadic scaling of the WT stimulated us to build a hierarchical meshing algorithm which transforms the initially regular data grid into a quadtree representation by rejection of unimportant mesh vertices. The optimum triangulation of the resulting quadtree cells is carried out by selection from a look-up table. The tree grows recursively, as controlled by the detail signals, which are computed from a modified inverse WT. In order to control the local level-of-detail, we introduce a new class of wavelet space filters acting as \"magnifying glasses\" on the data.","article_number":"480805","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=480805","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480805/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480805/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '95","conference_location":"Atlanta, GA, USA","conference_dates":"29 Oct.-3 Nov. 1995","publication_number":3467,"is_number":10213,"publication_year":1995,"publication_date":"29 Oct.-3 Nov. 1995","start_page":"135","end_page":"142","citing_paper_count":41,"citing_patent_count":16,"download_count":113,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Energy resolution","Signal resolution","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Surface waves","Tensile stress","Wavelet analysis","Wavelet transforms","Table lookup","Filters"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7187-4","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1995.480800","title":"Virtual GIS: a real-time 3D geographic information system","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-7187-4","issn":"1070-2385","partnum":"95CB35835","rank":36,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Coll. of Comput., Georgia Inst. of Technol., Atlanta, GA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37855991000","id":37855991000,"full_name":"D.

Based on the asymptotic decay of multiscale representations of spatially localized time evolutions of the data, singular points can be discriminated. Also, the corresponding Lipschitz exponents, which describe the signals' local regularity, can be determined, and can be taken as a measure of the variation in time.

The integration, velocity interpolation, and step size control are all performed in physical space which avoids the need to transform the velocity field into computational space. This leads to higher accuracy because there are no Jacobian matrix approximations, and expensive matrix inversions are eliminated. Integration accuracy is maintained using an adaptive step size control scheme which is regulated by the path line curvature. The problem of point location and interpolation in physical space is simplified by decomposing hexahedral cells into tetrahedral cells. This enables the point location to be done analytically and substantially faster than with a Newton-Raphson iterative method. Results presented show this algorithm is up to six times faster than particle tracers which operate on hexahedral cells, and produces almost identical traces.","article_number":"485145","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=485145","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/485145/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/485145/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '95","conference_location":"Atlanta, GA, USA","conference_dates":"29 Oct.-3 Nov. 1995","publication_number":3467,"is_number":10213,"publication_year":1995,"publication_date":"29 Oct.-3 Nov. 1995","start_page":"321","end_page":"328","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":134,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Interpolation","Size control","Jacobian matrices","Grid computing","Physics computing","Matrix decomposition","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Iterative methods","Iterative algorithms"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7187-4","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1995.480814","title":"Legibility enhancement for information visualisation","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-7187-4","issn":"1070-2385","partnum":"95CB35835","rank":44,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087741851","id":37087741851,"full_name":"R.

As a side effect, the tri-linear interpolation of data coded in such a way is very much simplified. These techniques allow us to perform walkthroughs at interactive frame rates.

We present an error tracking mechanism, which uses the available wavelet resources to measure the quality of the wavelet approximations.","article_number":"480811","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=480811","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480811/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480811/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '95","conference_location":"Atlanta, GA, USA","conference_dates":"29 Oct.-3 Nov. 1995","publication_number":3467,"is_number":10213,"publication_year":1995,"publication_date":"29 Oct.-3 Nov. 1995","start_page":"184","end_page":"191","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":49,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Wavelet analysis","Data visualization","Computer science","Wavelet transforms","Area measurement","Application software","Computer graphics","Painting","Shape","Loss measurement"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7187-4","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1995.480793","title":"Defining, computing, and visualizing molecular interfaces","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-7187-4","issn":"1070-2385","partnum":"95CB35835","rank":51,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, State University of New York, Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282560200","id":37282560200,"full_name":"A.
