However, many sources of data do not share this dimensional restriction. A critical problem in the analysis of such data is providing researchers with tools to gain insights into characteristics of the data, such as anomalies and patterns. Several visualization methods have been developed to address this problem, and each has its strengths and weaknesses. This paper describes a system named XmdvTool which integrates several of the most common methods for projecting multivariate data onto a two-dimensional screen. This integration allows users to explore their data in a variety of formats with ease. A view enhancement mechanism called an N-dimensional brush is also described. The brush allows users to gain insights into spatial relationships over N dimensions by highlighting data which falls within a user-specified subspace.<>","article_number":"346302","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=346302","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346302/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346302/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '94","conference_location":"Washington, DC, USA","conference_dates":"21-21 Oct. 1994","publication_number":1007,"is_number":8039,"publication_year":1994,"publication_date":"21-21 Oct. 1994","start_page":"326","end_page":"333","citing_paper_count":179,"citing_patent_count":17,"download_count":438,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Data analysis","Brushes","Displays","Computer science","Pattern analysis","Degradation"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-6627-7","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1994.346326","title":"The topology of symmetric, second-order tensor fields","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-6627-7","partnum":"94CH35707","rank":2,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Applied Physics, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37378372200","id":37378372200,"full_name":"T.

The goal is to represent their complex structure by a simple set of carefully chosen points and lines analogous to vector field topology. We extract topological skeletons of the eigenvector fields, and we track their evolution over time. We study tensor topological transitions and correlate tensor and vector data. The basic constituents of tensor topology are the degenerate points, or points where eigenvalues are equal to each other. Degenerate points play a similar role as critical points in vector fields. We identify two kinds of elementary degenerate points, which we call wedges and trisectors. They can combine to form more familiar singularities-such as saddles, nodes, centers, or foci. However, these are generally unstable structures in tensor fields. Finally, we show a topological rule that puts a constraint on the topology of tensor fields defined across surfaces, extending to tensor fields the Poincare-Hopf theorem for vector fields.<>","article_number":"346326","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=346326","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346326/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346326/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '94","conference_location":"Washington, DC, USA","conference_dates":"21-21 Oct. 1994","publication_number":1007,"is_number":8039,"publication_year":1994,"publication_date":"21-21 Oct. 1994","start_page":"140","end_page":"147","citing_paper_count":65,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":316,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Topology","Tensile stress","Skeleton","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Data visualization","Joining processes","Physics","Data mining","Constraint theory","Fluid flow"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-6627-7","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1994.346308","title":"Discretized Marching Cubes","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-6627-7","partnum":"94CH35707","rank":3,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"IEI-Consiglio Nazionale delle Richerche, Pisa, Italy","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37265786500","id":37265786500,"full_name":"C.

The combination of these two techniques results in a smooth transition between the two datasets and produces morphed volume with fewer high frequency distortions than those obtained from spatial domain volume morphing.<>","article_number":"346333","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=346333","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346333/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346333/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '94","conference_location":"Washington, DC, USA","conference_dates":"21-21 Oct. 1994","publication_number":1007,"is_number":8039,"publication_year":1994,"publication_date":"21-21 Oct. 1994","start_page":"85","end_page":"92","citing_paper_count":23,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":90,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Frequency","Wavelet domain","Interpolation","Deformable models","Facial animation","Topology","Helium","Computer science","Shape","Graphics"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-6627-7","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1994.346329","title":"Feature detection from vector quantities in a numerically simulated hypersonic flow field in combination with experimental flow visualization","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-6627-7","partnum":"94CH35707","rank":11,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"DLR, German Aerospace Research Establishment (DLR), Gottingen, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37372011800","id":37372011800,"full_name":"H.-G.

Most data sets in scientific visualization, whether created by measurement or simulation, are usually voluminous. The goal of data management is to reduce the storage space and the access time of these data sets to speed up the visualization process. A new progressive transmission scheme using spline biorthogonal wavelet bases is proposed in this paper. By exploiting the properties of this set of wavelet bases, a fast algorithm involving only additions and subtractions is developed. Due to the multiresolutional nature of the wavelet transform, this scheme is compatible with hierarchical-structured rendering algorithms. The formula for reconstructing the functional values in a continuous volume space is given in a simple polynomial form. Lossless compression is possible, even when using floating-point numbers. This algorithm has been applied to data from a global ocean model. The lossless compression ratio is about 1.5:1. With a compression ratio of 50:1, the reconstructed data is still of good quality. Several other wavelet bases are compared with the spline biorthogonal wavelet bases. Finally the reconstructed data is visualized using various algorithms and the results are demonstrated.<>","article_number":"346332","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=346332","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346332/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346332/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '94","conference_location":"Washington, DC, USA","conference_dates":"21-21 Oct. 1994","publication_number":1007,"is_number":8039,"publication_year":1994,"publication_date":"21-21 Oct. 1994","start_page":"93","end_page":"99","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":69,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Wavelet transforms","Data visualization","Continuous wavelet transforms","Spline","Polynomials","Discrete cosine transforms","Discrete wavelet transforms","Decoding","Filters","Computational modeling"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-6627-7","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1994.346334","title":"Isosurface generation by using extrema graphs","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-6627-7","partnum":"94CH35707","rank":15,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Tokyo Research Laboratory, IBM, Japan","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37537853900","id":37537853900,"full_name":"T.

Severe rainstorms are one of the consequences of El Nino, which cause great damage. An examination of daily data from 66 rainfall stations in the Chiura-Piura region of northwestern Peru from late 1982 through mid-1983 (associated with an El Nino episode) yields information on the mesoscale structure of these storms. These observational data are typical of a class that are scattered at irregular locations in two dimensions. The use of continuous realization techniques for qualitative visualization (e.g., surface deformation or contouring) requires an intermediate step to define a topological relationship between the locations of data to form a mesh structure. Several common methods are considered, and the results of their application to the study of the rainfall events are analyzed.<>","article_number":"346298","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=346298","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346298/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346298/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '94","conference_location":"Washington, DC, USA","conference_dates":"21-21 Oct. 1994","publication_number":1007,"is_number":8039,"publication_year":1994,"publication_date":"21-21 Oct. 1994","start_page":"350","end_page":"354","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":94,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Scattering","Meteorology","Oceans","Sea measurements","Storms","Rivers","Strips","Humans","Crops"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-6627-7","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1994.346297","title":"Visualization of mesoscale flow features in ocean basins","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-6627-7","partnum":"94CH35707","rank":23,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"NSF Engineering Research Center for Computational Field Simulation, Mississippi State University, MS, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37444949500","id":37444949500,"full_name":"A.

Plasma turbulence is very challenging from a theoretical point of view due to the nonlinearity and high dimensionality of the governing equations. Recent developments in algorithms along with the astounding advances in high performance computing now make first-principle particle simulations an important tool for improved understanding of such phenomena. Due to the five dimensional phase space (3 spatial, 2 velocity) and complex toroidal geometry, visualization is crucial for interpreting such simulation data.

Second, using /spl alpha/-shapes one can obtain quantitative measures of spatial properties of the system, such as the boundary length and interior area of clusters, that would be difficult to obtain otherwise.<>","article_number":"346337","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=346337","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346337/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346337/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '94","conference_location":"Washington, DC, USA","conference_dates":"21-21 Oct. 1994","publication_number":1007,"is_number":8039,"publication_year":1994,"publication_date":"21-21 Oct. 1994","start_page":"52","end_page":"59","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":54,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Shape","Monte Carlo methods","Data visualization","Application software","Temperature","Integral equations","Quantum computing","Quantum mechanics","Boundary conditions","Computer science"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-6627-7","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1994.346284","title":"Visualization and geographic information system integration: what are the needs and the requirements, if any?","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-6627-7","partnum":"94CH35707","rank":31,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Martin Marietta, U.

There are three levels of integration methods: rudimentary, operational and functional. The rudimentary approach uses the minimum amount of data sharing and exchange between these two technologies. The operational level attempts to provide consistency of the data while removing redundancies between the two technologies. The functional form attempts to provide transparent communication between these respective software environments. At this level, the user only needs to request information and the integrated system retrieves or generates the information depending upon the request. This paper examines the role and impact of these three levels of integration.

In recent years, computer graphics techniques have been applied to the task of visualizing such data. In particular, data visualization has been used to accomplish the virtual reconstruction of site architecture and to enable the display of spatial data distributions using three-dimensional models of site terrain. In the case we present here, these two approaches are integrated in the modeling of a prehistoric pithouse. In order to better visualize artifact distributions in the context of site architecture, surface data is displayed as a layer in a virtual reconstruction viewable at interactive rates. This integration of data display with the architectural model has proven valuable in identifying correlations between distributions of different artifact categories and their spatial proximity to significant architectural features.<>","article_number":"346296","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=346296","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346296/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346296/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '94","conference_location":"Washington, DC, USA","conference_dates":"21-21 Oct. 1994","publication_number":1007,"is_number":8039,"publication_year":1994,"publication_date":"21-21 Oct. 1994","start_page":"359","end_page":"362","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":53,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Computer graphics","Computer architecture","Solid modeling","Surface reconstruction","Computer displays","Application software","Three dimensional displays","Rendering (computer graphics)","Animation"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-6627-7","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1994.346287","title":"Visualizing multidimensional (multivariate) data and relations","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-6627-7","partnum":"94CH35707","rank":37,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Mass.-Lowell and MITRE Company, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294162600","id":37294162600,"full_name":"A.

In Alaska alone, there are over 40 active volcanoes whose eruptions may affect more than 40,000 flights using the great circle polar routes each year. The clouds are especially problematic because they are invisible to radar and nearly impossible to distinguish from weather clouds. The Arctic Region Supercomputing Center and the Alaska Volcano Observatory have collaborated to develop a system for predicting and visualizing the movement of volcanic ash clouds when an eruption occurs. The output from the model is combined with a digital elevation model to produce a realistic view of the ash cloud which may be examined interactively from any desired point of view at any time during the prediction period.

We then propose numerical metrics that can be used to measure filter characteristics that are relevant to the appearance of images generated using that filter. We apply those metrics to several previously used filters and relate the results to isosurface images of the interpolations.

Though this algorithm takes advantage of many of the unique features of the SP-1 (e.g. high-speed switch, large memory per node, high-speed disk array, HIPPI display, et al.), the use of Chameleon allows the code to be executed on any collection of workstations. The algorithm is image-ordered and distributes the data and the computational load to individual processors. After the volume data is distributed, all processors then perform local ray tracing of their respective subvolumes concurrently. No interprocess communication takes place during the ray tracing process.

As dataset size increases though, the computational demands of these methods can overwhelm typically available computing resources. Recent work on accelerating such techniques has focused on preprocessing the volume data or postprocessing the extracted polygonization. The algorithm presented, concentrates instead on streamlining the surface extraction process itself so as to accelerate the rendering of large volumes. The technique shortens the conventional isosurface visualization pipeline by eliminating the intermediate polygonization. We compute the contribution of the isosurface within a volume cell to the resulting image directly from a simplified numerical description of the cell/surface intersection. The approach also reduces the work in the remaining stages of the visualization process. By quantizing the volume data, we exploit precomputed and cached data at key processing steps to improve rendering efficiency. The resulting implementation provides comparatively fast renderings with reasonable image quality.<>","article_number":"346306","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=346306","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346306/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346306/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '94","conference_location":"Washington, DC, USA","conference_dates":"21-21 Oct. 1994","publication_number":1007,"is_number":8039,"publication_year":1994,"publication_date":"21-21 Oct. 1994","start_page":"293","end_page":"300","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":14,"download_count":51,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Isosurfaces","Rendering (computer graphics)","Data visualization","Surface fitting","Data mining","Computer graphics","Acceleration","Streaming media","Pipelines","Image quality"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-6627-7","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1994.346303","title":"An object oriented design for the visualization of multi-variable data objects","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-6627-7","partnum":"94CH35707","rank":58,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"EE&CS Department, George Washington University, Washington D.C., DC, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284061600","id":37284061600,"full_name":"J.M.

Traditional visualization systems focus on creating graphical objects which often cannot be re-used for further processing. Our approach provides objects of different topological dimension to offer a natural way of describing the results of visualization mappings. Serial composition of data extraction tools is allowed, while each intermediate visualization object shares a common description and behavior. Visualization objects can be re-used, facilitating the data exploration process by expanding the available analysis and correlation functions provided. This design offers an open-ended architecture for the development of new visualization techniques. It promotes data and software re-use, eliminates the need for writing special purpose software and reduces processing requirements during interactive visualization sessions.<>","article_number":"346303","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=346303","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346303/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346303/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '94","conference_location":"Washington, DC, USA","conference_dates":"21-21 Oct. 1994","publication_number":1007,"is_number":8039,"publication_year":1994,"publication_date":"21-21 Oct. 1994","start_page":"318","end_page":"325","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":108,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Geometry","Graphics","Data mining","Computer architecture","Writing","LAN interconnection","Data processing","Computer languages","Data structures"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-6627-7","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1994.346310","title":"The design and implementation of the Cortex visualization system","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-6627-7","partnum":"94CH35707","rank":59,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Centerra Resource Park, Fluent, Inc., Lebanon, NH, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37653860300","id":37653860300,"full_name":"D.

Unlike post-processing visualization environments, Cortex is designed to work in co-processing mode with the CFD application. This significantly reduces data storage and data movement requirements for visualization and also allows users to interactively steer the application. Further, Cortex supports high-performance by running on massively parallel computers and workstation clusters. An important goal for Cortex, is to provide visualization to a variety of solvers which differ in their solution methodologies and supported flow models. Coupled with the co-processing requirement, this has required the development of a well defined programming interface to the CFD solver that lets the visualization system communicate efficiently with the solver, and requires minimal programming effort for porting to new solvers. Further, the requirement for targeting multiple solvers and application niches demands that the visualization system be rapidly and easily modifiable. Such flexibility is attained in Cortex by using the high-level, interpreted language Scheme for implementing user-interfaces and high-level visualization functions. By making the Scheme interpreter available from the Cortex text interface, the user can also customize and extend the visualization system.<>","article_number":"346310","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=346310","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346310/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346310/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '94","conference_location":"Washington, DC, USA","conference_dates":"21-21 Oct. 1994","publication_number":1007,"is_number":8039,"publication_year":1994,"publication_date":"21-21 Oct. 1994","start_page":"265","end_page":"272","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":60,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Computational fluid dynamics","Brain modeling","Displays","Memory","Application software","Workstations","Analytical models","Concurrent computing","Computer networks"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-6627-7","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1994.346343","title":"Proceedings Visualization '94","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-6627-7","partnum":"94CH35707","rank":60,"authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Presents the front cover of the proceedings record.","article_number":"346343","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=346343","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/346343/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '94","conference_location":"Washington, DC, USA","conference_dates":"21-21 Oct. 1994","publication_number":1007,"is_number":8039,"publication_year":1994,"publication_date":"21-21 Oct. 1994","start_page":"0_1","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":81,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-6627-7","isbnType":"Historical"}]}}]}
