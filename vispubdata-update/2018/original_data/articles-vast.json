The goal of the mini challenge is to find evidence to support or refute the company's claim that the Rose-Crested Blue Pipit (RCBP) is thriving across the Preserve. This required to characterize the patterns of all the bird species in the Preserve and classify newly collected audio recordings into their corresponding species.

In particular, a new breed of AR games is engaging and visually appealing. In contrast, non-entertainment applications of AR generally tend to lack sophisticated content. This can be related to the fact that AR developers are only learning how to effectively use the new medium. But it also has to do with the lack of overlap in AR research and visualization research. While AR research has mostly been driven by computer vision with minimal consideration of the visual output, VIS is the field where the perceptual and cognitive foundations of visual information are studied. AR needs VIS! As AR matures, it will be vital to bring the two fields together. VIS needs to address the new medium AR, embracing its two key aspects: mobility and mixed real+virtual perception. AR poses new challenges for VIS, as the visual information needs to adapt to reality rather than shaping the entire visual domain. This talk will discuss fundamental properties of AR visualization and present examples of previous, current and future work.","article_number":"8802427","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8802427","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802427/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802427/","publication_title":"2018 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Berlin, Germany","conference_dates":"21-26 Oct. 2018","publication_number":8792226,"is_number":8802370,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"21-26 Oct. 2018","start_page":"1","end_page":"1","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":73,"insert_date":"20190819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Augmented reality","Mobile computing","Human computer interaction","Games","Engineering profession","Doppler effect"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6862-7","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6861-0","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2018.8802502","title":"Time Series Projection to Highlight Trends and Outliers","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5386-6862-7","rank":15,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087002703","id":37087002703,"full_name":"Eren Cakmak","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz"]}},{"affiliation":"Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085831457","id":37085831457,"full_name":"Daniel Seebacher","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz"]}},{"affiliation":"Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233607000","id":38233607000,"full_name":"Juri Buchmüller","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz"]}},{"affiliation":"Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","id":37283138700,"full_name":"Daniel A.

Sophisticated algorithmic techniques seek to identify and visualize non-accidental patterns that may be (causally) linked to mechanisms in the natural sciences, but also in the social sciences, medicine, technology, and governance. When we use machine learning algorithms to inspect the often high-dimensional, uncertain, and high-volume data to filter out and visualize relevant information, we aim to abstract from accidental factors in our experiments and thereby generalize over data fluctuations. Doing this, we often rely on highly nonlinear algorithms. This talk presents arguments advocating an information theoretic framework for algorithm analysis, where an algorithm is characterized as a computational evolution of a posterior distribution on the output space with a quantitative stopping criterion. The method allows us to investigate complex data analysis pipelines, such as those found in computational neuroscience, neurology, and molecular biology. I will demonstrate this concept for the validation of algorithms using the example of a statistical analysis of diffusion tensor imaging data. In addition, on the example of gene expression data, I will demonstrate how different spectral clustering methods can be validated by showing their robustness to data fluctuations and yet sufficient sensitivity to changes in the data. All in all, an information-theoretical method is presented for validating data analysis algorithms, offering the potential of more trustful results in Visual Analytics.","article_number":"8802482","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8802482","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802482/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802482/","publication_title":"2018 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Berlin, Germany","conference_dates":"21-26 Oct. 2018","publication_number":8792226,"is_number":8802370,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"21-26 Oct. 2018","start_page":"1","end_page":"1","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":118,"insert_date":"20190819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Signal processing algorithms","Machine learning algorithms","Pattern recognition","Neuroscience","Machine learning","Data visualization","Data analysis"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6862-7","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6861-0","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2018.8802509","title":"Analyzing the Noise Robustness of Deep Neural Networks","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5386-6862-7","rank":22,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Software, Tsinghua University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077049000","id":37077049000,"full_name":"Mengchen Liu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Software, Tsinghua University"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Software, Tsinghua University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406039100","id":37406039100,"full_name":"Shixia Liu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Software, Tsinghua University"]}},{"affiliation":"Dept.of Comp.Sci.Tech., Tsinghua University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085416706","id":37085416706,"full_name":"Hang Su","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Dept.of Comp.Sci.Tech., Tsinghua University"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Software, Tsinghua University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085845125","id":37085845125,"full_name":"Kelei Cao","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Software, Tsinghua University"]}},{"affiliation":"Dept.of Comp.Sci.Tech., Tsinghua University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490433400","id":38490433400,"full_name":"Jun Zhu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Dept.of Comp.Sci.Tech., Tsinghua University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to maliciously generated adversarial examples. These examples are intentionally designed by making imperceptible perturbations and often mislead a DNN into making an incorrect prediction. This phenomenon means that there is significant risk in applying DNNs to safety-critical applications, such as driverless cars. To address this issue, we present a visual analytics approach to explain the primary cause of the wrong predictions introduced by adversarial examples. The key is to analyze the datapaths of the adversarial examples and compare them with those of the normal examples. A datapath is a group of critical neurons and their connections. To this end, we formulate the datapath extraction as a subset selection problem and approximately solve it based on back-propagation. A multi-level visualization consisting of a segmented DAG (layer level), an Euler diagram (feature map level), and a heat map (neuron level), has been designed to help experts investigate datapaths from the high-level layers to the detailed neuron activations. Two case studies are conducted that demonstrate the promise of our approach in support of explaining the working mechanism of adversarial examples.","article_number":"8802509","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8802509","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802509/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802509/","publication_title":"2018 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Berlin, Germany","conference_dates":"21-26 Oct. 2018","publication_number":8792226,"is_number":8802370,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"21-26 Oct. 2018","start_page":"60","end_page":"71","citing_paper_count":36,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":875,"insert_date":"20190819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Neurons","Visual analytics","Tools","Feature extraction","Biological neural networks","Machine learning"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Deep neural networks","robustness","adversarial examples","back propagation","multi-level visualization."]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Deep Neural Network","Neuronal Activity","Feature Maps","Visual Analysis","Levels In Neurons","Self-driving","Self-driving Cars","Autonomous Cars","Directed Acyclic Graph","Incorrect Predictions","Datapath","Data Path","Adversarial Examples","Convolutional Neural Network","Recurrent Neural Network","Layer-by-layer","Neurons In Layer","Multilayer Perceptron","Deep Convolutional Neural Network","Part Of The Image","Dot Plots","Interactive Visualization","Normal Images","Adversarial Attacks","Visibility Graph","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Quadratic Optimization","Gradient-based Optimization","Gradient Descent Optimizer","NP-complete Problem","Black-box Attacks","Visual Analytics Tool"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6862-7","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6861-0","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2018.8802454","title":"EmbeddingVis: A Visual Analytics Approach to Comparative Network Embedding Inspection","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5386-6862-7","rank":23,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085720737","id":37085720737,"full_name":"Quan Li","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086945915","id":37086945915,"full_name":"Kristanto Sean Njotoprawiro","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086732743","id":37086732743,"full_name":"Hammad Haleem","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"WeChat, Tencent Technology (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086945841","id":37086945841,"full_name":"Qiaoan Chen","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["WeChat, Tencent Technology (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China"]}},{"affiliation":"WeChat, Tencent Technology (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086945693","id":37086945693,"full_name":"Chris Yi","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["WeChat, Tencent Technology (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085504538","id":37085504538,"full_name":"Xiaojuan Ma","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Constructing latent vector representation for nodes in a network through embedding models has shown its practicality in many graph analysis applications, such as node classification, clustering, and link prediction. However, despite the high efficiency and accuracy of learning an embedding model, people have little clue of what information about the original network is preserved in the embedding vectors. The abstractness of low-dimensional vector representation, stochastic nature of the construction process, and non-transparent hyper-parameters all obscure understanding of network embedding results. Visualization techniques have been introduced to facilitate embedding vector inspection, usually by projecting the embedding space to a two-dimensional display. Although the existing visualization methods allow simple examination of the structure of embedding space, they cannot support in-depth exploration of the embedding vectors. In this paper, we design an exploratory visual analytics system that supports the comparative visual interpretation of embedding vectors at the cluster, instance, and structural levels. To be more specific, it facilitates comparison of what and how node metrics are preserved across different embedding models and investigation of relationships between node metrics and selected embedding vectors. Several case studies confirm the efficacy of our system. Experts' feedback suggests that our approach indeed helps them better embrace the understanding of network embedding models.","article_number":"8802454","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8802454","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802454/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802454/","publication_title":"2018 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Berlin, Germany","conference_dates":"21-26 Oct. 2018","publication_number":8792226,"is_number":8802370,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"21-26 Oct. 2018","start_page":"48","end_page":"59","citing_paper_count":31,"citing_patent_count":2,"download_count":728,"insert_date":"20190819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Measurement","Task analysis","Analytical models","Visual analytics","Stochastic processes","Two dimensional displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Human-centered computing","Visualization","Visualization application domains","Visual analytics","Human-centered computing","Visualization","Visualization design and evaluation methods"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Network Embedding","Visual System","Structural Level","Latent Space","Embedding Space","Cluster Level","Vector Representation","Cluster Nodes","Embedding Vectors","Abstractness","Abstract Entities","Node Classification","Low-dimensional Vector","Link Prediction","Random Walk","Distance Distribution","Nodes In The Graph","Neighboring Nodes","PageRank","Supplementary Results","Pairwise Similarity","Neighborhood Structure","Neighbourhood Structure","Neighboring Structures","Average Vector","Node2vec","Nodes In Community","Similar Nodes","Visual Design","Participation Coefficient","t-SNE Projection","Decision Tree Regression","Original Graph","R2 Score","Visual Encoding"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6862-7","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6861-0","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2018.8802424","title":"The Effect of Semantic Interaction on Foraging in Text Analysis","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5386-6862-7","rank":24,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech Computer Science","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233577000","id":38233577000,"full_name":"John Wenskovitch","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virginia Tech Computer Science"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Defense","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37071531400","id":37071531400,"full_name":"Lauren Bradel","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Defense"]}},{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech Computer Science","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086544634","id":37086544634,"full_name":"Michelle Dowling","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virginia Tech Computer Science"]}},{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech Statistics","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38241765600","id":38241765600,"full_name":"Leanna House","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virginia Tech Statistics"]}},{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech Computer Science","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37419565900","id":37419565900,"full_name":"Chris North","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virginia Tech Computer Science"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Completing text analysis tasks is a continuous sensemaking loop of foraging for information and incrementally synthesizing it into hypotheses. Past research has shown the advantages of using spatial workspaces as a means for synthesizing information through externalizing hypotheses and creating spatial schemas. However, spatializing the entirety of datasets becomes prohibitive as the number of documents available to the analysts grows, particularly when only a small subset are relevant to the task at hand. StarSPIRE is a visual analytics tool designed to explore collections of documents, leveraging users' semantic interactions to steer (1) a synthesis model that aids in document layout, and (2) a foraging model to automatically retrieve new relevant information. In contrast to traditional keyword search foraging (KSF), “semantic interaction foraging” (SIF) occurs as a result of the user's synthesis actions. To quantify the value of semantic interaction foraging, we use StarSPIRE to evaluate its utility for an intelligence analysis sensemaking task. Semantic interaction foraging accounted for 26% of useful documents found, and it also resulted in increased synthesis interactions and improved sensemaking task performance by users in comparison to only using keyword search.","article_number":"8802424","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8802424","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802424/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802424/","publication_title":"2018 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Berlin, Germany","conference_dates":"21-26 Oct. 2018","publication_number":8792226,"is_number":8802370,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"21-26 Oct. 2018","start_page":"13","end_page":"24","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":227,"insert_date":"20190819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Semantics","Layout","Task analysis","Analytical models","Computational modeling","Data visualization","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Human-centered computing","Visualization","Empirical studies in visualization","Human-centered computing","Visualization","Visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Foraging","Semantic Interaction","Traditional Search","Analysis Strategy","Visual System","Relevant Model","Precision And Recall","Work Settings","Information Retrieval","Updated Model","Recommender Systems","Recall Score","Precision Score","Specific Search","Confirmation Bias","Collection Of Papers","Document Collection","Main Plot","Spatial Layout","Relevant Threshold","Sense-making Process","Monkeypox","Human Monkeypox","Mpox","Visual Encoding","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Graduate Students","User Study","Synthesis Process"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6862-7","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6861-0","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2018.8802486","title":"SMARTexplore: Simplifying High-Dimensional Data Analysis through a Table-Based Visual Analytics Approach","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5386-6862-7","rank":25,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086249850","id":37086249850,"full_name":"Michael Blumenschein","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38551542600","id":38551542600,"full_name":"Michael Behrisch","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086943825","id":37086943825,"full_name":"Stefanie Schmid","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37683008700","id":37683008700,"full_name":"Simon Butscher","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086941601","id":37086941601,"full_name":"Deborah R.

These spatial layouts provide overviews of the evolution patterns of ego-networks, thereby revealing different global patterns such as trends, clusters and outliers in evolution patterns. To let analysts interactively construct interpretable spatial layouts, we propose a data transformation pipeline, with which analysts can adjust the spatial layouts and convert dynamic ego-networks into event sequences to aid interpretations of the spatial positions.

In Mini-Challenge 3, participants took their analysis global, examining suspicious connections in Kasios' international business dealings in a massive graph challenge.","article_number":"8802465","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8802465","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802465/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802465/","publication_title":"2018 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Berlin, Germany","conference_dates":"21-26 Oct. 2018","publication_number":8792226,"is_number":8802370,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"21-26 Oct. 2018","start_page":"84","end_page":"89","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":191,"insert_date":"20190819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Companies","Birds","Visual analytics","Wildlife","Chemicals","Sociology","Statistics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Wildlife Conservation","Wildlife Protection","Hydrological","Songbirds","Birdsong","Interactive","Submission","Exploratory Analysis","Exploratory Data Analysis","Critical Thinking","Critical Analysis","Critical Reflection","Critical Appraisal","Multinational Enterprises","Multinational Corporations","Multinational Companies","MNCs","Transnational Corporations","Visual Analysis","Analysis Tasks","Human Experts","Student Teams","Award Winners","Peking University"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6862-7","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6861-0","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2018.8802449","title":"The Effect of Proximity in Social Data Charts on Perceived Unity","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5386-6862-7","rank":29,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086942182","id":37086942182,"full_name":"Marlen Promann","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37598999800","id":37598999800,"full_name":"Sabine Brunswicker","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Social data charts - visual presentations of quantitative data about peer behaviors - may offer new means to motivate individuals to participate in group goals. However, to do so these charts need to create a semantic response of `unity' among the chart viewers in order to overcome the problems of social loafing where people act selfishly and undervalue the group's goal. In this paper, we focus on two properties of social data charts that may affect a viewer's perceptions of unity: (1) The skewness in the data structure - the statistical distribution of the social data, and (2) the proximity in the visual structure of the chart - the spatial organization of the data points. We performed a controlled perceptual experiment to examine the effect of proximity and skewness on four different semantic facets of perceived group unity: similarity, entitativity, rapport, and centrality. We exposed 179 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk to different group charts using a 2 x 2 factorial design, varying both proximity and skewness. Our two-way ANCOVA analyses reveal three important findings: (1) Across all conditions, proximity has a strong positive effect on perceived group unity and conveys a social meaning of group entitativity, as well as, member similarity and rapport; (2) Skewness and proximity interact in a non-linear way, suggesting that skewness creates a negative force that modifies the semantic responses to high proximity; and (3) The perceptual responses to proximity have different semantic facets that are either stable or sensitive to skewness. These findings contribute to perceptual as well as social InfoVis literature.","article_number":"8802449","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8802449","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802449/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802449/","publication_title":"2018 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Berlin, Germany","conference_dates":"21-26 Oct. 2018","publication_number":8792226,"is_number":8802370,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"21-26 Oct. 2018","start_page":"1","end_page":"12","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":281,"insert_date":"20190819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Data visualization","Semantics","Data structures","Psychology","Social groups","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Social visualization","information visualization","Gestalt theory","controlled experiment","data density","data spread","perception","group identity","unity","priming","Human-centered computing","Empirical studies in HCI","Displays and imagers","Social engineering (social sciences)","Visualization theory, concepts and paradigms"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Proximity Effect","Proximal Events","Chart Data","Data Structure","Analysis Of Covariance","Statistical Distribution","Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function","Empirical Distribution Function","Factorial Design","Factorial Experiment","Spatial Organization","Perceptual Responses","Non-linear Way","Group Goals","Peer Behavior","Peer Behaviour","Two-way Analysis Of Covariance","Cronbach’s Alpha","Control Variables","Social Groups","Data Visualization","Social Identity","Social Perception","Personal Perceptions","Global Structure","Perceptions Of Groups","Perceptual Similarity","Social Dilemma","Collective Action Problems","Social Dilemmas","Affective Priming","Levels Of Empathy","Spatial Density","Cooperative Behavior","Cooperative Behaviour","Social Identity Theory","Perceptual Task","Stream Of Work"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6862-7","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6861-0","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2018.8802371","title":"VAST 2018 Preface","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5386-6862-7","rank":30,"authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Presents the introductory welcome message from the conference proceedings.
