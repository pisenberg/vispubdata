We characterize dashboards by their design goals, levels of interaction, and the practices around them.

Despite the strong performance of RNNs, it is often challenging for users to understand why the model makes a particular prediction. Such black-box nature of RNNs can impede its wide adoption in clinical practice. Furthermore, we have no established methods to interactively leverage users' domain expertise and prior knowledge as inputs for steering the model. Therefore, our design study aims to provide a visual analytics solution to increase interpretability and interactivity of RNNs via a joint effort of medical experts, artificial intelligence scientists, and visual analytics researchers. Following the iterative design process between the experts, we design, implement, and evaluate a visual analytics tool called RetainVis, which couples a newly improved, interpretable, and interactive RNN-based model called RetainEX and visualizations for users' exploration of EMR data in the context of prediction tasks. Our study shows the effective use of RetainVis for gaining insights into how individual medical codes contribute to making risk predictions, using EMRs of patients with heart failure and cataract symptoms. Our study also demonstrates how we made substantial changes to the state-of-the-art RNN model called RETAIN in order to make use of temporal information and increase interactivity. This study will provide a useful guideline for researchers that aim to design an interpretable and interactive visual analytics tool for RNNs.","article_number":"8440842","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440842","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440842/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440842/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"299","end_page":"309","citing_paper_count":162,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":4181,"insert_date":"20180820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Machine learning","Medical diagnostic imaging","Task analysis","Predictive models","Computational modeling","Visual analytics","Data models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Interactive Artificial Intelligence","XAI (Explainable Artificial Intelligence)","Interpretable Deep Learning","Healthcare"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive","Medical Records","Health Records","Electronic Health Records","Electronic Medical Records","Visual Analysis","Recurrent Neural Network","Heart Failure","Cardiac Dysfunction","Cataract","Visualization Tool","Prediction Task","Domain Experts","Medical Experts","Medical Codes","Clinical Codes","Recurrent Neural Network Model","Individual Codes","Electronic Medical Record Data","RNN-based Models","Visual Analytics Tool","Coronary Artery Disease","Coronary Heart","Coronary Disease","Coronary Heart Disease","Ischemic Heart Disease","Deep Learning","High Scores","Target User","Medical Tasks","Prediction Score","Diagnosis Of Patients","Code Number","Deep Learning Models","Patient Visits","Model Interpretation","Embedding Matrix","Embedding Matrices","Artificial Neural Network","Neural Network Model"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865240","title":"Formalizing Visualization Design Knowledge as Constraints: Actionable and Extensible Models in Draco","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":3,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Washington","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085711170","id":37085711170,"full_name":"Dominik Moritz","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Washington"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543759","id":37086543759,"full_name":"Chenglong Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Washington"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086545160","id":37086545160,"full_name":"Greg L.

While empirical studies can provide design guidance, we lack a formal framework for representing design knowledge, integrating results across studies, and applying this knowledge in automated design tools that promote effective encodings and facilitate visual exploration. We propose modeling visualization design knowledge as a collection of constraints, in conjunction with a method to learn weights for soft constraints from experimental data. Using constraints, we can take theoretical design knowledge and express it in a concrete, extensible, and testable form: the resulting models can recommend visualization designs and can easily be augmented with additional constraints or updated weights. We implement our approach in Draco, a constraint-based system based on Answer Set Programming (ASP). We demonstrate how to construct increasingly sophisticated automated visualization design systems, including systems based on weights learned directly from the results of graphical perception experiments.","article_number":"8440847","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440847","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440847/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440847/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"438","end_page":"448","citing_paper_count":143,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2843,"insert_date":"20180820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Encoding","Task analysis","Tools","Visualization","Programming","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Automated Visualization Design","Perceptual Effectiveness","Constraints","Knowledge Bases","Answer Set Programming"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Design","Design Knowledge","Design Cognition","Design Guidelines","Learned Weights","Soft Constraints","Multi-objective Optimization","Multi-objective Problem","Bar Charts","Design Space","Preferred Model","Preference Model","Cost Model","Visual Model","Visual Space","Knowledge Representation","Hard Constraints","Single Plot","Constraint Satisfaction Problem","Constraint Solver","Program Logic","Design Preferences","Preferred Design","Paired Rank","Set Of Facts","Constraint Programming","Integrality Constraints","Learning To Rank","Learning-to-rank","Visual Encoding","Logical Language","Logic Programming Language","Query Data","Knowledge Base","Knowledge-based","Optimal Visualization","Set Of Rules"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864812","title":"RuleMatrix: Visualizing and Understanding Classifiers with Rules","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":4,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, HK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086012043","id":37086012043,"full_name":"Yao Ming","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, HK"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, HK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, HK"]}},{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38267713800","id":38267713800,"full_name":"Enrico Bertini","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"With the growing adoption of machine learning techniques, there is a surge of research interest towards making machine learning systems more transparent and interpretable.

We present Manifold, a framework that utilizes visual analysis techniques to support interpretation, debugging, and comparison of machine learning models in a more transparent and interactive manner. Conventional techniques usually focus on visualizing the internal logic of a specific model type (i.e., deep neural networks), lacking the ability to extend to a more complex scenario where different model types are integrated. To this end, Manifold is designed as a generic framework that does not rely on or access the internal logic of the model and solely observes the input (i.e., instances or features) and the output (i.e., the predicted result and probability distribution). We describe the workflow of Manifold as an iterative process consisting of three major phases that are commonly involved in the model development and diagnosis process: inspection (hypothesis), explanation (reasoning), and refinement (verification). The visual components supporting these tasks include a scatterplot-based visual summary that overviews the models' outcome and a customizable tabular view that reveals feature discrimination. We demonstrate current applications of the framework on the classification and regression tasks and discuss other potential machine learning use scenarios where Manifold can be applied.","article_number":"8440091","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440091","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440091/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440091/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"364","end_page":"373","citing_paper_count":116,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2778,"insert_date":"20180819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Analytical models","Task analysis","Machine learning","Manifolds","Data models","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Interactive machine learning","performance analysis","model comparison","model debugging"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Machine Learning","Machine-learning","Manifold","Machine Learning Models","Interactive","Prediction Results","Predictor Of Outcomes","Deep Neural Network","Iterative Process","Model Comparison","Classification Task","Categorization Task","Discriminative Features","Complex Scenarios","Debugging","Diagnosis Process","Internal Logic","Visual Summary","Model Performance","End-users","Prediction Score","Multi-label","Multi-class Classification","Multi-label Classification","Visual Comparison","Ground-truth Class","Ensemble Model","Visual Design","Ride-hailing","Ridesourcing","E-hailing","Transportation Network Companies","Alternative Designs","Alternative Names","Representative Subset","Subset Of Instances","Red Bars","Blue Bars","Input Instance","Term Frequency-inverse Document Frequency","Inverse Document Frequency","TF-IDF"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864475","title":"iForest: Interpreting Random Forests via Visual Analytics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":6,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086249213","id":37086249213,"full_name":"Xun Zhao","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Visa Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085523487","id":37085523487,"full_name":"Yanhong Wu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visa Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37280605800","id":37280605800,"full_name":"Dik Lun Lee","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37391623900","id":37391623900,"full_name":"Weiwei Cui","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"As an ensemble model that consists of many independent decision trees, random forests generate predictions by feeding the input to internal trees and summarizing their outputs. The ensemble nature of the model helps random forests outperform any individual decision tree. However, it also leads to a poor model interpretability, which significantly hinders the model from being used in fields that require transparent and explainable predictions, such as medical diagnosis and financial fraud detection. The interpretation challenges stem from the variety and complexity of the contained decision trees. Each decision tree has its unique structure and properties, such as the features used in the tree and the feature threshold in each tree node. Thus, a data input may lead to a variety of decision paths. To understand how a final prediction is achieved, it is desired to understand and compare all decision paths in the context of all tree structures, which is a huge challenge for any users. In this paper, we propose a visual analytic system aiming at interpreting random forest models and predictions. In addition to providing users with all the tree information, we summarize the decision paths in random forests, which eventually reflects the working mechanism of the model and reduces users' mental burden of interpretation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, two usage scenarios and a qualitative user study are conducted.","article_number":"8454906","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8454906","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8454906/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8454906/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"407","end_page":"416","citing_paper_count":109,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":3573,"insert_date":"20180905","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Forestry","Vegetation","Predictive models","Decision trees","Machine learning","Cognition","Impurities"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Interpretable Machine Learning","Random Forests","Random Forest Visualization","Visual Analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Random Forest","Decision Tree","Visual System","Physical Work","Mechanical Work","Random Forest Model","Final Prediction","Ensemble Model","Tree Structure","Tree-structured","Usage Scenarios","Random Forest Prediction","Individual Decision Trees","Training Data","Important Characteristics","Feature Importance","Machine Learning Models","Feature Values","Characteristic Values","Prediction Score","Task Design","Identification Task","Trade Balance","Trade Deficit","Trade Surplus","Account Balance","Balance Of Payments","Net Exports","Outlier Data","Overview Of Data","Case-based Reasoning","Case Based Reasoning","Split Point","Partial Dependence Plots","Loan Application","Loan Applicants","Line Chart","High-confidence Predictions","Similar Examples","Positive Path","Negative Path","Understanding Of Models"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865152","title":"DXR: A Toolkit for Building Immersive Data Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":7,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085349078","id":37085349078,"full_name":"Ronell Sicat","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086529603","id":37086529603,"full_name":"Jiabao Li","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, Ulsan, KR","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087129037","id":37087129037,"full_name":"Junyoung Choi","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, Ulsan, KR"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University, Clayton, VIC, AU","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085649401","id":37085649401,"full_name":"Maxime Cordeil","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University, Clayton, VIC, AU"]}},{"affiliation":"Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, Ulsan, KR","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268212100","id":37268212100,"full_name":"Won-Ki Jeong","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, Ulsan, KR"]}},{"affiliation":"The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Edinburgh, GB","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085687578","id":37085687578,"full_name":"Benjamin Bach","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Edinburgh, GB"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275698100","id":37275698100,"full_name":"Hanspeter Pfister","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, US"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"This paper presents DXR, a toolkit for building immersive data visualizations based on the Unity development platform. Over the past years, immersive data visualizations in augmented and virtual reality (AR, VR) have been emerging as a promising medium for data sense-making beyond the desktop. However, creating immersive visualizations remains challenging, and often require complex low-level programming and tedious manual encoding of data attributes to geometric and visual properties. These can hinder the iterative idea-to-prototype process, especially for developers without experience in 3D graphics, AR, and VR programming. With DXR, developers can efficiently specify visualization designs using a concise declarative visualization grammar inspired by Vega-Lite.

NLG-based visualization systems typically leverage a suite of statistical functions to automatically extract key facts about the underlying data and surface them as natural language sentences alongside visualizations. With current systems, users are typically required to read the system-generated sentences and mentally map them back to the accompanying visualization. However, depending on the features of the visualization (e.g., visualization type, data density) and the complexity of the data fact, mentally mapping facts to visualizations can be a challenging task. Furthermore, more than one visualization could be used to illustrate a single data fact. Unfortunately, current tools provide little or no support for users to explore such alternatives. In this paper, we explore how system-generated data facts can be treated as interactive widgets to help users interpret visualizations and communicate their findings. We present Voder, a system that lets users interact with automatically-generated data facts to explore both alternative visualizations to convey a data fact as well as a set of embellishments to highlight a fact within a visualization. Leveraging data facts as interactive widgets, Voder also facilitates data fact-based visualization search. To assess Voder's design and features, we conducted a preliminary user study with 12 participants having varying levels of experience with visualization tools. Participant feedback suggested that interactive data facts aided them in interpreting visualizations. Participants also stated that the suggestions surfaced through the facts helped them explore alternative visualizations and embellishments to communicate individual data facts.","article_number":"8440860","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440860","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440860/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440860/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"672","end_page":"681","citing_paper_count":89,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2565,"insert_date":"20180820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Tools","Visualization","Natural languages","Data mining","Histograms","Complexity theory"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Natural Language Generation","Mixed-initiative Interaction","Visualization Recommendation","Data-driven Communication"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Natural Language","Visual System","User Study","Visualization Tool","Participant Feedback","Text Generation","Sentence Generation","Natural Language Generation","Relevant Factors","Data Visualization","Classification Task","Categorization Task","None Of The Participants","Exploratory Data","End Of Session","End Of Each Session","Bar Charts","Analysis Tasks","Numerous Properties","Numerous Attributes","Numerical Attributes","Numerous Dimensions","Numerical Properties","Aspects Of The Data","Split-plot","Split-plot Design","Automatic Generation","List Of Values","Visual Exploration","Set Of Heuristics","Natural Language Understanding","Query Features","Non-expert Users","Categorical Attributes","Classification Properties","Attribute Classification","Subjective Feedback","Bullet Points","Alternative Way"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864504","title":"DQNViz: A Visual Analytics Approach to Understand Deep Q-Networks","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":11,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"The Ohio State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085897852","id":37085897852,"full_name":"Junpeng Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The Ohio State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Visa Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37075500200","id":37075500200,"full_name":"Liang Gou","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visa Research"]}},{"affiliation":"The Ohio State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279493500","id":37279493500,"full_name":"Han-Wei Shen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The Ohio State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Visa Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086368522","id":37086368522,"full_name":"Hao Yang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visa Research"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Deep Q-Network (DQN), as one type of deep reinforcement learning model, targets to train an intelligent agent that acquires optimal actions while interacting with an environment. The model is well known for its ability to surpass professional human players across many Atari 2600 games. Despite the superhuman performance, in-depth understanding of the model and interpreting the sophisticated behaviors of the DQN agent remain to be challenging tasks, due to the long-time model training process and the large number of experiences dynamically generated by the agent. In this work, we propose DQNViz, a visual analytics system to expose details of the blind training process in four levels, and enable users to dive into the large experience space of the agent for comprehensive analysis. As an initial attempt in visualizing DQN models, our work focuses more on Atari games with a simple action space, most notably the Breakout game. From our visual analytics of the agent's experiences, we extract useful action/reward patterns that help to interpret the model and control the training. Through multiple case studies conducted together with deep learning experts, we demonstrate that DQNViz can effectively help domain experts to understand, diagnose, and potentially improve DQN models.","article_number":"8454905","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8454905","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8454905/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8454905/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"288","end_page":"298","citing_paper_count":82,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2607,"insert_date":"20180905","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Training","Games","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Analytical models","Learning (artificial intelligence)","Machine learning"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Deep Q-Network (DQN)","reinforcement learning","model interpretation","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Deep Q-network","Deep Learning","Deep Learning Models","Domain Experts","Model Training Process","Reinforcement Learning Model","Superhuman","Experience Of Agency","Deep Reinforcement Learning Model","Deep Neural Network","Movement Patterns","Deep Convolutional Neural Network","Training Stage","Input State","Input Conditions","Behavior Of Agents","Behaviour Of Agents","Regular Expressions","Regex","Digging","Saliency Map","Filters In Layer","Filters In Each Layer","Random Action","Reward Distribution","Chart Types","Maximum Reward","Pattern Mining","Pattern Length","Pattern Lengths","Movement Of Agents","Stacked Bar","Individual Episodes","Stacked Bar Charts"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864889","title":"In Pursuit of Error: A Survey of Uncertainty Visualization Evaluation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":12,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Northwestern University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38016234500","id":38016234500,"full_name":"Jessica Hullman","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543223","id":37086543223,"full_name":"Xiaoli Qiao","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Washington"]}},{"affiliation":"Tableau Software","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38230607000","id":38230607000,"full_name":"Michael Correll","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tableau Software"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543362","id":37086543362,"full_name":"Alex Kale","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Washington"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Michigan","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38529287400","id":38529287400,"full_name":"Matthew Kay","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Michigan"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Understanding and accounting for uncertainty is critical to effectively reasoning about visualized data. However, evaluating the impact of an uncertainty visualization is complex due to the difficulties that people have interpreting uncertainty and the challenge of defining correct behavior with uncertainty information. Currently, evaluators of uncertainty visualization must rely on general purpose visualization evaluation frameworks which can be ill-equipped to provide guidance with the unique difficulties of assessing judgments under uncertainty. To help evaluators navigate these complexities, we present a taxonomy for characterizing decisions made in designing an evaluation of an uncertainty visualization. Our taxonomy differentiates six levels of decisions that comprise an uncertainty visualization evaluation: the behavioral targets of the study, expected effects from an uncertainty visualization, evaluation goals, measures, elicitation techniques, and analysis approaches. Applying our taxonomy to 86 user studies of uncertainty visualizations, we find that existing evaluation practice, particularly in visualization research, focuses on Performance and Satisfaction-based measures that assume more predictable and statistically-driven judgment behavior than is suggested by research on human judgment and decision making. We reflect on common themes in evaluation practice concerning the interpretation and semantics of uncertainty, the use of confidence reporting, and a bias toward evaluating performance as accuracy rather than decision quality. We conclude with a concrete set of recommendations for evaluators designed to reduce the mismatch between the conceptualization of uncertainty in visualization versus other fields.","article_number":"8457476","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8457476","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8457476/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8457476/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"903","end_page":"913","citing_paper_count":79,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":3316,"insert_date":"20180911","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty","Visualization","Taxonomy","Data visualization","Task analysis","Measurement uncertainty","Decision making"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty visualization","user study","subjective confidence","probability distribution"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Evaluation","Visual Rating","Uncertainty Visualization","Decision-making","Decision Making","Semantic","Performance Measures","User Study","Vision Research","Uncertainty Information","Decision Quality","Decision Level","Elicitation Techniques","Elicitation Procedure","Heuristic","Rule Of Thumb","Multiple-choice","Multiple Choice","User Experience","Risk Aversion","Risk Attitudes","Risk Tolerance","Risk-averse","Taxonomic Levels","Bayesian Estimation","Bayesian Computation","User Behavior","User Behaviour","Design Evaluation","Subjective Confidence","User Quality Of Experience","Think-aloud Protocols","Qualitative Coding","Utility Maximization","Self-reported Satisfaction","Signal Detection Theory","Detection Theory","Bayesian Reasoning","Bayesian Logic","Utility Theory","User Responses"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865041","title":"ForVizor: Visualizing Spatio-Temporal Team Formations in Soccer","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":13,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","id":37407308300,"full_name":"Yingcai Wu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086448603","id":37086448603,"full_name":"Xiao Xie","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086242334","id":37086242334,"full_name":"Jiachen Wang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086544875","id":37086544875,"full_name":"Dazhen Deng","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086546613","id":37086546613,"full_name":"Hongye Liang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Sport Science, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086236404","id":37086236404,"full_name":"Hui Zhang","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Sport Science, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Sport Science, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547287","id":37086547287,"full_name":"Shoubin Cheng","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Sport Science, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37291847800","id":37291847800,"full_name":"Wei Chen","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Regarded as a high-level tactic in soccer, a team formation assigns players different tasks and indicates their active regions on the pitch, thereby influencing the team performance significantly.

The spatio-temporal nature of formations and other characteristics of soccer data, such as multivariate features, make analysis of formations in soccer a challenging problem. In this study, we closely worked with domain experts to characterize domain problems of formation analysis in soccer and formulated several design goals. We design a novel spatio-temporal visual representation of changes in team formation, allowing analysts to visually analyze the evolution of formations and track the spatial flow of players within formations over time. Based on the new design, we further design and develop ForVizor, a visual analytics system, which empowers users to track the spatio-temporal changes in formation and understand how and why such changes occur.

Charticulator is our response to most existing chart construction interfaces that require authors to choose from predefined chart layouts, thereby precluding the construction of novel charts. In contrast, Charticulator transforms a chart specification into mathematical layout constraints and automatically computes a set of layout attributes using a constraint-solving algorithm to realize the chart. It allows for the articulation of compound marks or glyphs as well as links between these glyphs, all without requiring any coding or knowledge of constraint satisfaction. Furthermore, thanks to the constraint-based layout approach, Charticulator can export chart designs into reusable templates that can be imported into other visualization tools.

A large number of techniques have been proposed to reduce visual clutter of flow maps, such as filtering, clustering and edge bundling, but the correlations of OD flows are often neglected, which makes the simplified OD flow map present little semantic information. In this paper, a characterization of OD flows is established based on an analogy between OD flows and natural language processing (NPL) terms. Then, an iterative multi-objective sampling scheme is designed to select OD flows in a vectorized representation space. To enhance the readability of sampled OD flows, a set of meaningful visual encodings are designed to present the interactions of OD flows. We design and implement a visual exploration system that supports visual inspection and quantitative evaluation from a variety of perspectives. Case studies based on real-world datasets and interviews with domain experts have demonstrated the effectiveness of our system in reducing the visual clutter and enhancing correlations of OD flows.","article_number":"8440039","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440039","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440039/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440039/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"43","end_page":"53","citing_paper_count":70,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2510,"insert_date":"20180819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Data visualization","Clutter","Geospatial analysis","Semantics","Mobile handsets","Correlation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual abstraction","human mobility","origin-destination","flow map","representation learning"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Abstract","Mobile Phone","Visual System","Cartographic","Simple Function","Simple Mapping","Human Movement","Real-world Datasets","Real-world Data Sets","Domain Experts","Vector Representation","Mobility Patterns","Visual Exploration","Flow Map","Human Mobility Patterns","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Commonly-used Methods","Commonly-used Method","Interactive","Mass Flow","Distribution Of Points","Betweenness","Function Matrix","Functional Matrices","Mapping Matrix","Adaptive Sampling","Word Embedding","Word Vectors","Map View","Set Of Metrics","Adaptive Noise","Pairs Of Loci","Locus Pairs","Distribution Of Communities","Variety Of Constraints","Word2vec Model","Skip-gram Model"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865191","title":"FiberClay: Sculpting Three Dimensional Trajectories to Reveal Structural Insights","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":16,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"ENAC, Toulouse University, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017336200","id":38017336200,"full_name":"Christophe Hurter","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["ENAC, Toulouse University, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590950700","id":37590950700,"full_name":"Nathalie Henry Riche","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37585786500","id":37585786500,"full_name":"Steven M.

Air traffic controllers for example deal with large quantities of aircrafts routes to optimize safety in airspace and neuroscientists attempt to understand neuronal pathways in the human brain by visualizing bundles of fibers from DTI images. Extracting insights from masses of 3D trajectories is challenging as the multiple three dimensional lines have complex geometries, may overlap, cross or even merge with each other, making it impossible to follow individual ones in dense areas. As trajectories are inherently spatial and three dimensional, we propose FiberClay: a system to display and interact with 3D trajectories in immersive environments. FiberClay renders a large quantity of trajectories in real time using GP-GPU techniques. FiberClay also introduces a new set of interactive techniques for composing complex queries in 3D space leveraging immersive environment controllers and user position. These techniques enable an analyst to select and compare sets of trajectories with specific geometries and data properties. We conclude by discussing insights found using FiberClay with domain experts in air traffic control and neurology.","article_number":"8440808","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440808","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440808/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440808/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"704","end_page":"714","citing_paper_count":69,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1463,"insert_date":"20180820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Trajectory","Two dimensional displays","Optical fiber devices","Aircraft navigation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Immersive Analytics","3D Visualization","Dynamic Queries","Bimanual Interaction","Multidimensional Data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Surface Density","Area Density","Areal Density","Diffusion Tensor Imaging","Diffusion-weighted Imaging","Diffusion Weighted Imaging","Diffusion Tensor","3D Space","3-dimensional Space","Domain Experts","Air Control","Air Traffic Control","Time Trajectories","Immersive Environment","Interaction Techniques","Real-time Trajectory","Virtually","Virtual Environment","Virtual Reality","Navigation","Worldview","Time Interaction","Matched Controls","Exploratory Data","Multidimensional Data","Multidimensional Analysis","Set Of Interactions","Interactive Visualization","3D Environment","Flat Panel","Flat Panel Displays","Flat Screen","2D Visualization","2D Systems","Binocular Disparity","Fixation Disparity","Trajectory Dataset","Trajectory Data Set","Qualitative Feedback","Interactive Exploration","Dimensions Of Elements","Depth Perception","Depth Cues","Inverse Distance Weighting","Jet Stream","Subtropical Jet"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864838","title":"VIS4ML: An Ontology for Visual Analytics Assisted Machine Learning","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":17,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Universitat Konstanz, Konstanz, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085566394","id":37085566394,"full_name":"Dominik Sacha","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universitat Konstanz, Konstanz, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, DE"]}},{"affiliation":"Universitat Konstanz, Konstanz, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086236869","id":37086236869,"full_name":"Matthias Kraus","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universitat Konstanz, Konstanz, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, DE"]}},{"affiliation":"Universitat Konstanz, Konstanz, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","id":37283138700,"full_name":"Daniel A.

In this paper, we propose an ontology (VIS4ML) for a subarea of VA, namely “VA-assisted ML”. The purpose of VIS4ML is to describe and understand existing VA workflows used in ML as well as to detect gaps in ML processes and the potential of introducing advanced VA techniques to such processes. Ontologies have been widely used to map out the scope of a topic in biology, medicine, and many other disciplines. We adopt the scholarly methodologies for constructing VIS4ML, including the specification, conceptualization, formalization, implementation, and validation of ontologies. In particular, we reinterpret the traditional VA pipeline to encompass model-development workflows. We introduce necessary definitions, rules, syntaxes, and visual notations for formulating VIS4ML and make use of semantic web technologies for implementing it in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). VIS4ML captures the high-level knowledge about previous workflows where VA is used to assist in ML. It is consistent with the established VA concepts and will continue to evolve along with the future developments in VA and ML. While this ontology is an effort for building the theoretical foundation of VA, it can be used by practitioners in real-world applications to optimize model-development workflows by systematically examining the potential benefits that can be brought about by either machine or human capabilities. Meanwhile, VIS4ML is intended to be extensible and will continue to be updated to reflect future advancements in using VA for building high-quality data-analytical models or for building such models rapidly.","article_number":"8440124","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440124","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440124/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440124/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"385","end_page":"395","citing_paper_count":65,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2485,"insert_date":"20180819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Ontologies","Data visualization","Analytical models","Data models","Task analysis","OWL","Machine learning"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analytics","Visualization","Machine Learning","Human-Computer Interaction","Ontology","VIS4ML"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Learning Process","Machine Learning Models","Web Ontology Language","OWL Ontologies","Raw Data","Neural Network","Learning Models","Decision Tree","Data Mining","Data-mining","Machine Learning Techniques","Machine-learning Techniques","Automatic Processing","Human Cognition","Human Knowledge","Visualization Techniques","Conceptual Research","Self-organizing Map","Kohonen","Human Decision","Machine Learning Framework","Machine-learning Framework","Machine Learning Systems","Visual Exploration","Feature Extraction Algorithm","Ontology Development","Compact Notation","Syntactic Rules","Phrase Structure Rules","Incoming Connections","Knowledge Map","Knowledge Captured","Interactive","Confusion Matrix","Confusion Matrices","Candidate Features","Characterization Of Candidates","Feedback Loop"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865192","title":"Origin-Destination Flow Maps in Immersive Environments","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":18,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Monash University, Clayton, VIC, AU","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085820538","id":37085820538,"full_name":"Yalong Yang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University, Clayton, VIC, AU"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University, Clayton, VIC, AU","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37326161000","id":37326161000,"full_name":"Tim Dwyer","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University, Clayton, VIC, AU"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University, Clayton, VIC, AU","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38488917300","id":38488917300,"full_name":"Bernhard Jenny","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University, Clayton, VIC, AU"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University, Clayton, VIC, AU","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37354163600","id":37354163600,"full_name":"Kim Marriott","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University, Clayton, VIC, AU"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University, Clayton, VIC, AU","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085649401","id":37085649401,"full_name":"Maxime Cordeil","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University, Clayton, VIC, AU"]}},{"affiliation":"Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Canberra, ACT, AU","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086546105","id":37086546105,"full_name":"Haohui Chen","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Canberra, ACT, AU"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Immersive virtual- and augmented-reality headsets can overlay a flat image against any surface or hang virtual objects in the space around the user. The technology is rapidly improving and may, in the long term, replace traditional flat panel displays in many situations. When displays are no longer intrinsically flat, how should we use the space around the user for abstract data visualisation? In this paper, we ask this question with respect to origin-destination flow data in a global geographic context. We report on the findings of three studies exploring different spatial encodings for flow maps. The first experiment focuses on different 2D and 3D encodings for flows on flat maps. We find that participants are significantly more accurate with raised flow paths whose height is proportional to flow distance but fastest with traditional straight line 2D flows. In our second and third experiment we compared flat maps, 3D globes and a novel interactive design we call MapsLink, involving a pair of linked flat maps. We find that participants took significantly more time with MapsLink than other flow maps while the 3D globe with raised flows was the fastest, most accurate, and most preferred method. Our work suggests that careful use of the third spatial dimension can resolve visual clutter in complex flow maps.","article_number":"8440844","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440844","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440844/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440844/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"693","end_page":"703","citing_paper_count":64,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1784,"insert_date":"20180820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three-dimensional displays","Data visualization","Two dimensional displays","Encoding","Clutter","Virtual reality","Aerospace electronics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Origin-destination","Flow Map","Virtual Reality","Cartographic Information Visualisation","Immersive Analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Immersive Environment","Flow Map","Origin-destination Flow","Interactive","Straight Line","Flow Data","Third Dimension","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","2D Flow","Head Movements","Accuracy Scores","Friedman Test","Design Space","3D Representation","Original Map","Line Balancing","Flow Lines","Head-mounted Display","Log-transformed Values","Visual Design","3D Distance","3D Flow","2D Representation","Reference Space","Virtual Reality Headset","Virtual Reality Head-mounted Display","VR Headset","Origin Destination","Bezier Curve","Cubic Bézier","Bézier Curves","2D Line","Strongest Preference","Eye Position"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864909","title":"Hypothetical Outcome Plots Help Untrained Observers Judge Trends in Ambiguous Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":19,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Washington","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543362","id":37086543362,"full_name":"Alex Kale","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Washington"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087012720","id":37087012720,"full_name":"Francis Nguyen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Washington"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Michigan","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38529287400","id":38529287400,"full_name":"Matthew Kay","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Michigan"]}},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38016234500","id":38016234500,"full_name":"Jessica Hullman","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Animated representations of outcomes drawn from distributions (hypothetical outcome plots, or HOPs) are used in the media and other public venues to communicate uncertainty.

However, it is unclear how well HOPs support applied tasks resembling real world judgments posed in uncertainty communication. We identify and motivate an appropriate task to investigate realistic judgments of uncertainty in the public domain through a qualitative analysis of uncertainty visualizations in the news. We contribute two crowdsourced experiments comparing the effectiveness of HOPs, error bars, and line ensembles for supporting perceptual decision-making from visualized uncertainty. Participants infer which of two possible underlying trends is more likely to have produced a sample of time series data by referencing uncertainty visualizations which depict the two trends with variability due to sampling error. By modeling each participant's accuracy as a function of the level of evidence presented over many repeated judgments, we find that observers are able to correctly infer the underlying trend in samples conveying a lower level of evidence when using HOPs rather than static aggregate uncertainty visualizations as a decision aid.

For example, to interpret colormaps, people must determine how dimensions of color (e.g., lightness, hue) map onto quantities of a given measure (e.g., brain activity, correlation magnitude). This process is easier when the encoded mappings in the visualization match people's predictions of how visual features will map onto concepts, their inferred mappings. To harness this principle in visualization design, it is necessary to understand what factors determine people's inferred mappings. In this study, we investigated how inferred color-quantity mappings for colormap data visualizations were influenced by the background color. Prior literature presents seemingly conflicting accounts of how the background color affects inferred color-quantity mappings. The present results help resolve those conflicts, demonstrating that sometimes the background has an effect and sometimes it does not, depending on whether the colormap appears to vary in opacity. When there is no apparent variation in opacity, participants infer that darker colors map to larger quantities (dark-is-more bias). As apparent variation in opacity increases, participants become biased toward inferring that more opaque colors map to larger quantities (opaque-is-more bias). These biases work together on light backgrounds and conflict on dark backgrounds. Under such conflicts, the opaque-is-more bias can negate, or even supersede the dark-is-more bias. The results suggest that if a design goal is to produce colormaps that match people's inferred mappings and are robust to changes in background color, it is beneficial to use colormaps that will not appear to vary in opacity on any background color, and to encode larger quantities in darker colors.","article_number":"8454346","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8454346","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8454346/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8454346/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"810","end_page":"819","citing_paper_count":55,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2759,"insert_date":"20180903","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image color analysis","Data visualization","Visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual Reasoning","Visual Communication","Colormaps","Color Perception","Visual Encoding","Visual Design"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Visualization","Color Map","Colour Map","Colormap","Large Quantities","Larger Amount","Visual Features","Visual Characteristics","Dark Color","Dark Colour","Apparent Discrepancy","Apparent Variation","Dark Background","Background Light","Spatial Patterns","Spatiotemporal Patterns","Temporal Patterns","Grayscale","Greyscale","Gray Level","Hot Spots","Linear Interpolation","Light Color","Light Colour","Color Space","Colour Space","Color Components","Properties Of Data","Data Attributes","Black Background","White Background","Pair Of Points","Distinct Color","Distinct Colour","Accuracy Range","Kind Of Scale","Role Of Background","Faster RTs","Faster RT","Normal Color Vision","Normal Colour Vision","Kinds Of Tasks","Dark Regions","Highest Contrast","3-way Interaction","Mean Accuracy"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865040","title":"Futzing and Moseying: Interviews with Professional Data Analysts on Exploration Practices","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":21,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543089","id":37086543089,"full_name":"Sara Alspaugh","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, US"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086544132","id":37086544132,"full_name":"Nava Zokaei","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, US"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543867","id":37086543867,"full_name":"Andrea Liu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, US"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543374","id":37086543374,"full_name":"Cindy Jin","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, US"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38181244800","id":38181244800,"full_name":"Marti A.

However, identifying relevant structures in unlabeled, high-dimensional data is nontrivial, requiring iterative experimentation with clustering parameters as well as data features and instances. The number of possible clusterings for a typical dataset is vast, and navigating in this vast space is also challenging. The absence of ground-truth labels makes it impossible to define an optimal solution, thus requiring user judgment to establish what can be considered a satisfiable clustering result. Data scientists need adequate interactive tools to effectively explore and navigate the large clustering space so as to improve the effectiveness of exploratory clustering analysis. We introduce Clustrophile 2, a new interactive tool for guided clustering analysis. Clustrophile 2 guides users in clustering-based exploratory analysis, adapts user feedback to improve user guidance, facilitates the interpretation of clusters, and helps quickly reason about differences between clusterings. To this end, Clustrophile 2 contributes a novel feature, the Clustering Tour, to help users choose clustering parameters and assess the quality of different clustering results in relation to current analysis goals and user expectations. We evaluate Clustrophile 2 through a user study with 12 data scientists, who used our tool to explore and interpret sub-cohorts in a dataset of Parkinson's disease patients. Results suggest that Clustrophile 2 improves the speed and effectiveness of exploratory clustering analysis for both experts and non-experts.","article_number":"8440035","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440035","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440035/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440035/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"267","end_page":"276","citing_paper_count":53,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1655,"insert_date":"20180819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Tools","Data visualization","Visualization","Clustering algorithms","Data analysis","Space exploration","Dimensionality reduction"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Clustering tour","Guided data analysis","Exploratory data analysis","Interactive clustering analysis","Interpretability","Explainability","Visual data exploration recommendation","Dimensionality reduction","What-if analysis","Clustrophile","Unsupervised learning"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Cluster Analysis","Exploratory Analysis","Exploratory Data Analysis","Characteristics Of Data","Features Of Data","User Study","Data Clustering","Clustering Results","Parkinson’s Disease Patients","Ground Truth Labels","Interactive Tool","Data Instances","Instantaneous Data","User Feedback","Clustering Quality","Clustering Parameters","Dimensionality Reduction","Clustering Algorithm","Pairwise Correlations","Pairwise Correlation Coefficients","Domain Experts","Cluster Assignment","Cluster Design","Clusters Of Points","Clustering Metrics","Different Numbers Of Clusters","Choice Of Features","Choice Of Characteristics","User Goals","Clusters Of Data Points","Data Points In Each Cluster","Cluster Solution","Combination Of Metrics","Heatmap Visualization","Choice Of Algorithm","Main View"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865146","title":"A Heuristic Approach to Value-Driven Evaluation of Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":23,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085898933","id":37085898933,"full_name":"Emily Wall","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543432","id":37086543432,"full_name":"Meeshu Agnihotri","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681577000","id":37681577000,"full_name":"Laura Matzen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086250936","id":37086250936,"full_name":"Kristin Divis","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086260992","id":37086260992,"full_name":"Michael Haass","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681759500","id":37681759500,"full_name":"Alex Endert","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267736900","id":37267736900,"full_name":"John Stasko","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, US"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Recently, an approach for determining the value of a visualization was proposed, one moving beyond simple measurements of task accuracy and speed.

This articulation of value is purely descriptive, however, providing no actionable method of assessing a visualization's value. In this work, we create a heuristic-based evaluation methodology to accompany the value equation for assessing interactive visualizations. We refer to the methodology colloquially as ICE-T, based on an anagram of the four value components. Our approach breaks the four components down into guidelines, each of which is made up of a small set of low-level heuristics. Evaluators who have knowledge of visualization design principles then assess the visualization with respect to the heuristics. We conducted an initial trial of the methodology on three interactive visualizations of the same data set, each evaluated by 15 visualization experts. We found that the methodology showed promise, obtaining consistent ratings across the three visualizations and mirroring judgments of the utility of the visualizations by instructors of the course in which they were developed.","article_number":"8454343","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8454343","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8454343/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8454343/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"491","end_page":"500","citing_paper_count":52,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2199,"insert_date":"20180903","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Task analysis","Usability","Visualization","Benchmark testing","Tools","Guidelines"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization evaluation","heuristics","value of visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Education Courses","Evaluation Methodology","Interactive Visualization","Visual Design","Set Of Heuristics","Inter-rater","Inter-rater Reliability","Inter-rater Agreement","Data Visualization","Quality Assurance","Related Data","Low Confidence","Evaluation Approach","Rate Approach","Methodological Assessment","Domain Experts","Value Of Assessment","Levels Of Hierarchy","Visual Evaluation","Visual Rating","Visual Score","Understanding Of The Data","Visual Ability","Valuable Framework","Parallel Coordinates","Benchmark Tasks","Heuristic Evaluation","Invalid Data"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865077","title":"Comparing Similarity Perception in Time Series Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":24,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Universite Paris-Sud, Orsay, ÃŽle-de-France, FR","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086546569","id":37086546569,"full_name":"Anna Gogolou","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universite Paris-Sud, Orsay, ÃŽle-de-France, FR"]}},{"affiliation":"Universite Paris-Sud, Orsay, ÃŽle-de-France, FR","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085357220","id":37085357220,"full_name":"Theophanis Tsandilas","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universite Paris-Sud, Orsay, ÃŽle-de-France, FR"]}},{"affiliation":"Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, ÃŽle-de-France, FR","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283168600","id":37283168600,"full_name":"Themis Palpanas","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, ÃŽle-de-France, FR"]}},{"affiliation":"Universite Paris-Sud, Orsay, ÃŽle-de-France, FR","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267832500","id":37267832500,"full_name":"Anastasia Bezerianos","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universite Paris-Sud, Orsay, ÃŽle-de-France, FR"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"A common challenge faced by many domain experts working with time series data is how to identify and compare similar patterns. This operation is fundamental in high-level tasks, such as detecting recurring phenomena or creating clusters of similar temporal sequences. While automatic measures exist to compute time series similarity, human intervention is often required to visually inspect these automatically generated results. The visualization literature has examined similarity perception and its relation to automatic similarity measures for line charts, but has not yet considered if alternative visual representations, such as horizon graphs and colorfields, alter this perception. Motivated by how neuroscientists evaluate epileptiform patterns, we conducted two experiments that study how these three visualization techniques affect similarity perception in EEG signals. We seek to understand if the time series results returned from automatic similarity measures are perceived in a similar manner, irrespective of the visualization technique; and if what people perceive as similar with each visualization aligns with different automatic measures and their similarity constraints. Our findings indicate that horizon graphs align with similarity measures that allow local variations in temporal position or speed (i.e., dynamic time warping) more than the two other techniques. On the other hand, horizon graphs do not align with measures that are insensitive to amplitude and y-offset scaling (i.e., measures based on z-normalization), but the inverse seems to be the case for line charts and colorfields. Overall, our work indicates that the choice of visualization affects what temporal patterns we consider as similar, i.e., the notion of similarity in time series is not visualization independent.","article_number":"8440826","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440826","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440826/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440826/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"523","end_page":"533","citing_paper_count":51,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2208,"insert_date":"20180820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Time series analysis","Task analysis","Visualization","Data visualization","Time measurement","Electroencephalography","Encoding"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Time series","similarity perception","automatic similarity search","line charts","horizon graphs","colorfields","evaluation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Time Series","Time-series","Perceptual Similarity","Time Series Visualization","Time-series Visualization","Spatial Patterns","Spatiotemporal Patterns","Temporal Patterns","Similarity Measure","Similarity Metrics","Visual Representation","EEG Signals","Domain Experts","Visualization Techniques","Similar Note","Time Warping","Automatic Measurement","Line Chart","Dynamic Time Warping","Similar Time Series","Time-series Similarity","Patterns In Data","EEG Data","Simple Pattern","Agreement Values","Similar Algorithms","Epileptiform Discharges","Vertical Space","Visual Encoding","Vertical Shift","Vertical Translation","Number Of Time Series","Types Of Answers","Similar Answers","Color Fields","Colour Field","Pearson's Moment Correlation","Pearson's Moment Correlation Coefficient","Realistic Patterns"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865076","title":"IDMVis: Temporal Event Sequence Visualization for Type 1 Diabetes Treatment Decision Support","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":25,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, Boston, MA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086544588","id":37086544588,"full_name":"Yixuan Zhang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University, Boston, MA, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, Boston, MA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086546942","id":37086546942,"full_name":"Kartik Chanana","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University, Boston, MA, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, Boston, MA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38350716800","id":38350716800,"full_name":"Cody Dunne","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University, Boston, MA, US"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Type 1 diabetes is a chronic, incurable autoimmune disease affecting millions of Americans in which the body stops producing insulin and blood glucose levels rise.

A typical approach to explore such data utilizes interactive visualizations with multiple coordinated views. Each view displays the aggregated measures along one or two dimensions. By brushing on the views, analysts can obtain detailed information. However, this approach often cannot provide sufficient guidance for analysts to identify patterns hidden within subsets of data. Without a priori hypotheses, analysts need to manually select and iterate through different slices to search for patterns, which can be a tedious and lengthy process. In this work, we model multidimensional ST data as tensors and propose a novel piecewise rank-one tensor decomposition algorithm which supports automatically slicing the data into homogeneous partitions and extracting the latent patterns in each partition for comparison and visual summarization. The algorithm optimizes a quantitative measure about how faithfully the extracted patterns visually represent the original data. Based on the algorithm we further propose a visual analytics framework that supports a top-down, progressive partitioning workflow for level-of-detail multidimensional ST data exploration. We demonstrate the general applicability and effectiveness of our technique on three datasets from different application domains: regional sales trend analysis, customer traffic analysis in department stores, and taxi trip analysis with origin-destination (OD) data.

However, no empirical evidence exists on the effectiveness and efficiency of these visualization techniques in solving analytical tasks featured by fuzzy clusters. In this paper, we conduct a controlled experiment to evaluate the ability of fuzzy clusters analysis to use four multi-dimensional visualization techniques, namely, parallel coordinate plot, scatterplot matrix, principal component analysis, and Radviz. First, we define the analytical tasks and their representative questions specific to fuzzy clusters analysis. Then, we design objective questionnaires to compare the accuracy, time, and satisfaction in using the four techniques to solve the questions. We also design subjective questionnaires to collect the experience of the volunteers with the four techniques in terms of ease of use, informativeness, and helpfulness. With a complete experiment process and a detailed result analysis, we test against four hypotheses that are formulated on the basis of our experience, and provide instructive guidance for analysts in selecting appropriate and efficient visualization techniques to analyze fuzzy clusters.","article_number":"8440829","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440829","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440829/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440829/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"12","end_page":"21","citing_paper_count":48,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1482,"insert_date":"20180820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Task analysis","Principal component analysis","Visualization","Encoding","Clustering algorithms","Correlation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Evaluation","multi-dimensional visualization","fuzzy clustering","parallel coordinate plot","scatterplot matrix","principal component analysis","radviz"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Fuzzy Clustering","Multidimensional Visualization","Usability","Ease Of Use","Multidimensional Data","Multidimensional Analysis","Real-world Scenarios","Analysis Tasks","Visualization Techniques","Detailed Analysis Of The Results","Subjective Questionnaire","Volunteer Experience","Multidimensional Techniques","Scatterplot Matrix","Scatter Plot Matrix","Scatterplot Matrices","Results Of Experiments","Maximum And Minimum","Stationary Point","Extreme Values","Extremal","Analysis Techniques","Clustering Results","Friedman Test","2D Plane","Tukey HSD Test","Dimensionality Reduction Methods","Dimensionality Reduction Method","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Cluster Representatives","Subjective Metrics","Metrics For Each Subject","Round Of Experiments","Objective Metrics","Representative Items","Visual Encoding","Academic Background","Dominant Cluster","Customer Groups"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864885","title":"Visual Progression Analysis of Event Sequence Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":28,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547434","id":37086547434,"full_name":"Shunan Guo","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["East China Normal University"]}},{"affiliation":"iDVX lab, Tongji University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547579","id":37086547579,"full_name":"Zhuochen Jin","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["iDVX lab, Tongji University"]}},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601397400","id":37601397400,"full_name":"David Gotz","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085829363","id":37085829363,"full_name":"Fan Du","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland"]}},{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271683100","id":37271683100,"full_name":"Hongyuan Zha","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["East China Normal University"]}},{"affiliation":"iDVX lab, Tongji University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604309600","id":37604309600,"full_name":"Nan Cao","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["iDVX lab, Tongji University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Event sequence data is common to a broad range of application domains, from security to health care to scholarly communication. This form of data captures information about the progression of events for an individual entity (e.g., a computer network device; a patient; an author) in the form of a series of time-stamped observations. Moreover, each event is associated with an event type (e.g., a computer login attempt, or a hospital discharge). Analyses of event sequence data have been shown to help reveal important temporal patterns, such as clinical paths resulting in improved outcomes, or an understanding of common career trajectories for scholars. Moreover, recent research has demonstrated a variety of techniques designed to overcome methodological challenges such as large volumes of data and high dimensionality. However, the effective identification and analysis of latent stages of progression, which can allow for variation within different but similarly evolving event sequences, remain a significant challenge with important real-world motivations. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised stage analysis algorithm to identify semantically meaningful progression stages as well as the critical events which help define those stages. The algorithm follows three key steps: (1) event representation estimation, (2) event sequence warping and alignment, and (3) sequence segmentation. We also present a novel visualization system, ET2, which interactively illustrates the results of the stage analysis algorithm to help reveal evolution patterns across stages. Finally, we report three forms of evaluation for ET2: (1) case studies with two real-world datasets, (2) interviews with domain expert users, and (3) a performance evaluation on the progression analysis algorithm and the visualization design.","article_number":"8440811","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440811","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440811/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440811/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"417","end_page":"426","citing_paper_count":45,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1824,"insert_date":"20180820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Diseases","Aggregates","Data visualization","Pattern matching","Interviews"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Progression Analysis","Visual Analysis","Event Sequence Data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Sequence Of Events","Visual Analysis","Analysis Of Sequencing Data","Event Sequence Data","Sequence Alignment","Key Step","Evolutionary Patterns","Developmental Patterns","Visual System","Hospital Discharge","Analysis Algorithm","Stages Of Progression","Real-world Datasets","Real-world Data Sets","Domain Experts","Sequence Segments","Visual Design","Expert Users","Latent Stage","Interaction Analysis","Pattern Analysis","Cluster Nodes","Frequent Pattern","Dynamic Time Warping","Progression Patterns","Sequence Patterns","Node Positions","Location Of Nodes","Visualization Techniques","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Average Sequence Length","Average Sequence Lengths","Progression Analysis"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865193","title":"Visualizing Uncertain Tropical Cyclone Predictions using Representative Samples from Ensembles of Forecast Tracks","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":29,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Magic Weaver Inc., Santa Clara, CA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086034524","id":37086034524,"full_name":"Le Liu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Magic Weaver Inc., Santa Clara, CA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085907327","id":37085907327,"full_name":"Lace Padilla","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, US"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085899393","id":37085899393,"full_name":"Sarah H.

For example, the US National Hurricane Center generates multiple day predictions for a storm's path, size, and wind speed, and then uses a Monte Carlo approach to sample this prediction into a large ensemble of potential storm outcomes. Various forms of summary visualizations are generated from such an ensemble, often using spatial spread to indicate its statistical characteristics. However, studies have shown that changes in the size of such summary glyphs, representing changes in the uncertainty of the prediction, are frequently confounded with other attributes of the phenomenon, such as its size or strength. In addition, simulation ensembles typically encode multivariate information, which can be difficult or confusing to include in a summary display. This problem can be overcome by directly displaying the ensemble as a set of annotated trajectories, however this solution will not be effective if ensembles are densely overdrawn or structurally disorganized. We propose to overcome these difficulties by selectively sampling the original ensemble, constructing a smaller representative and spatially well organized ensemble. This can be drawn directly as a set of paths that implicitly reveals the underlying spatial uncertainty distribution of the prediction. Since this approach does not use a visual channel to encode uncertainty, additional information can more easily be encoded in the display without leading to visual confusion. To demonstrate our argument, we describe the development of a visualization for ensembles of tropical cyclone forecast tracks, explaining how their spatial and temporal predictions, as well as other crucial storm characteristics such as size and intensity, can be clearly revealed. We verify the effectiveness of this visualization approach through a cognitive study exploring how storm damage estimates are affected by the density of tracks drawn, and by the presence or absence of annotating information on storm size and intensity.","article_number":"8440837","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440837","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440837/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440837/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"882","end_page":"891","citing_paper_count":41,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1070,"insert_date":"20180820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Storms","Uncertainty","Visualization","Hurricanes","Tropical cyclones","Prediction algorithms","Predictive models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["uncertainty visualization","hurricane forecasts","ensemble visualization","ensemble sampling","implicit uncertainty"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Track Forecast","US National","Prediction Uncertainty","Spatial Spread","Spatial Spreading","Storm Intensity","Spatial Uncertainty","Damage Estimation","Storm Damage","Track Density","Forecasting","Radial Basis Function","Left Region","Original Point","Normal Direction","Points In Region","Red Points","Damage Rate","Evaluation Of Damage","Blue Points","Continuous Field","Number Of Tracks","Set Of Tracks","Original Track","Self-intersection","Ensemble Forecasts","Search Region","Oil Rig","Polyline","Full Ensemble","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Hierarchical Regression","Multilevel Analysis","Multilevel Models","Hierarchical Multiple Regression"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864907","title":"Looks Good To Me: Visualizations As Sanity Checks","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":30,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Tableau Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38230607000","id":38230607000,"full_name":"Michael Correll","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tableau Research"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Arizona","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086545166","id":37086545166,"full_name":"Mingwei Li","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Arizona"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Chicago","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282742400","id":37282742400,"full_name":"Gordon Kindlmann","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Chicago"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Arizona","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550809300","id":37550809300,"full_name":"Carlos Scheidegger","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Arizona"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Famous examples such as Anscombe's Quartet highlight that one of the core benefits of visualizations is allowing people to discover visual patterns that might otherwise be hidden by summary statistics. This visual inspection is particularly important in exploratory data analysis, where analysts can use visualizations such as histograms and dot plots to identify data quality issues. Yet, these visualizations are driven by parameters such as histogram bin size or mark opacity that have a great deal of impact on the final visual appearance of the chart, but are rarely optimized to make important features visible. In this paper, we show that data flaws have varying impact on the visual features of visualizations, and that the adversarial or merely uncritical setting of design parameters of visualizations can obscure the visual signatures of these flaws. Drawing on the framework of Algebraic Visualization Design, we present the results of a crowdsourced study showing that common visualization types can appear to reasonably summarize distributional data while hiding large and important flaws such as missing data and extraneous modes. We make use of these results to propose additional best practices for visualizations of distributions for data quality tasks.","article_number":"8440818","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440818","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440818/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440818/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"830","end_page":"839","citing_paper_count":41,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1245,"insert_date":"20180820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Histograms","Bandwidth","Data integrity","Kernel","Data analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Graphical perception","data quality","univariate visualizations"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Sanity Check","Histogram","Data Quality","Exploratory Analysis","Exploratory Data Analysis","Parameter Settings","Design Parameters","Visual Signals","Dot Plots","Visual Design","Data Quality Issues","Histogram Bins","Signal Detection","Visual System","Sampling Error","Hallucinations","Shape Of Distribution","Detection Task","Visual Feedback","Video Feedback","Density Plots","Anomaly Detection","Visualization Of Distribution","Gap Detection","Detection Of Breaks","Middle Of The Distribution","Conservative Set","Visual Map","Kernel Bandwidth","Kernel Bandwidths","Large Bandwidth","Large Bandwidths","Strong Prior","Chart Types"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864814","title":"BitExTract: Interactive Visualization for Extracting Bitcoin Exchange Intelligence","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":31,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, HK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543179","id":37086543179,"full_name":"Xuanwu Yue","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, HK"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, HK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086245904","id":37086245904,"full_name":"Xinhuan Shu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, HK"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, HK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547631","id":37086547631,"full_name":"Xinyu Zhu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, HK"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, HK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086253170","id":37086253170,"full_name":"Xinnan Du","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, HK"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, HK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086546384","id":37086546384,"full_name":"Zheqing Yu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, HK"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, HK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086425301","id":37086425301,"full_name":"Dimitrios Papadopoulos","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, HK"]}},{"affiliation":"Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37538552000","id":37538552000,"full_name":"Siyuan Liu","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, US"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The emerging prosperity of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, has come into the spotlight during the past few years. Cryptocurrency exchanges, which act as the gateway to this world, now play a dominant role in the circulation of Bitcoin. Thus, delving into the analysis of the transaction patterns of exchanges can shed light on the evolution and trends in the Bitcoin market, and participants can gain hints for identifying credible exchanges as well. Not only Bitcoin practitioners but also researchers in the financial domains are interested in the business intelligence behind the curtain. However, the task of multiple exchanges exploration and comparisons has been limited owing to the lack of efficient tools. Previous methods of visualizing Bitcoin data have mainly concentrated on tracking suspicious transaction logs, but it is cumbersome to analyze exchanges and their relationships with existing tools and methods. In this paper, we present BitExTract, an interactive visual analytics system, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first attempt to explore the evolutionary transaction patterns of Bitcoin exchanges from two perspectives, namely, exchange versus exchange and exchange versus client. In particular, BitExTract summarizes the evolution of the Bitcoin market by observing the transactions between exchanges over time via a massive sequence view. A node-link diagram with ego-centered views depicts the trading network of exchanges and their temporal transaction distribution. Moreover, BitExTract embeds multiple parallel bars on a timeline to examine and compare the evolution patterns of transactions between different exchanges. Three case studies with novel insights demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of our system.","article_number":"8440044","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440044","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440044/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440044/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"162","end_page":"171","citing_paper_count":41,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1940,"insert_date":"20180819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Bitcoin","Data visualization","Visualization","Task analysis","Tools"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Bitcoin exchange","transaction data","comparative analysis","visual analytics","FinTech"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive Visualization","Visual System","Visual Analysis","Central Pattern","Exchange Patterns","Trade Network","Business Intelligence","Business Information","Cryptocurrencies","Exchange Networks","Financial Domain","Parallel Bars","Market Share","Market-based","Vertical Line","Heuristic Algorithm","Heuristic Function","Domain Experts","Anomaly Detection","Foreign Exchange","Vertical Bars","Vertical Pipe","Vert","Public Key","Key Pair","Public-key","Number Of Exchanges","Transaction Volume","Transaction Data","Transaction Amount","Exchange Partners","Blockchain Data","Co-authors Of This Paper","Transaction History","Online Gambling","Internet Gambling","Selected Time Period","Selected Time Periods"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865029","title":"Situ: Identifying and Explaining Suspicious Behavior in Networks","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":32,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550746600","id":37550746600,"full_name":"John R.

Anomaly detection methods are beneficial for detecting new types of attacks and abnormal network activity, but such algorithms can be difficult to understand and trust. Network operators and cyber analysts need fast and scalable tools to help identify suspicious behavior that bypasses automated security systems, but operators do not want another automated tool with algorithms they do not trust. Experts need tools to augment their own domain expertise and to provide a contextual understanding of suspicious behavior to help them make decisions. In this paper we present Situ, a visual analytics system for discovering suspicious behavior in streaming network data. Situ provides a scalable solution that combines anomaly detection with information visualization. The system's visualizations enable operators to identify and investigate the most anomalous events and IP addresses, and the tool provides context to help operators understand why they are anomalous. Finally, operators need tools that can be integrated into their workflow and with their existing tools. This paper describes the Situ platform and its deployment in an operational network setting. We discuss how operators are currently using the tool in a large organization's security operations center and present the results of expert reviews with professionals.","article_number":"8440825","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440825","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440825/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440825/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"204","end_page":"214","citing_paper_count":39,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2097,"insert_date":"20180820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Network security","Machine learning","Anomaly detection","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Network security","situational awareness","privacy and security","streaming data","machine learning","visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Scalable","Visual System","Visual Analysis","Domain Experts","Large Organizations","Set Of Operations","Anomaly Detection","Anomalous Events","Security Analysts","Detection System","Volume Of Data","Intensity Data","Behavioral Model","Contextual Effects","Visualization Tool","Visualization Techniques","Situational Awareness","Network Flow","Blacklist","Anomaly Score","Intrusion Detection System","Visual Design","Detail Page","Small Packets","Malware","Maximum A Posteriori","Maximum-a-posteriori","Attack Scenarios","Commercial Tools","Multinomial Distribution"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864843","title":"An Interactive Method to Improve Crowdsourced Annotations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":33,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406039100","id":37406039100,"full_name":"Shixia Liu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"]}},{"affiliation":"Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086544275","id":37086544275,"full_name":"Changjian Chen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"]}},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085342409","id":37085342409,"full_name":"Yafeng Lu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543368","id":37086543368,"full_name":"Fangxin Ouyang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"]}},{"affiliation":"Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37538974200","id":37538974200,"full_name":"Bin Wang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In order to effectively infer correct labels from noisy crowdsourced annotations, learning-from-crowds models have introduced expert validation.

The early stages of collaborations are typically time consuming for all stakeholders as researchers piece together an understanding of domain challenges from disparate discussions and meetings. A number of recent projects, however, report on the use of creative visualization-opportunities (CVO) workshops to accelerate the early stages of applied work, eliciting a wealth of requirements in a few days of focused work. Yet, there is no established guidance for how to use such workshops effectively. In this paper, we present the results of a 2-year collaboration in which we analyzed the use of 17 workshops in 10 visualization contexts. Its primary contribution is a framework for CVO workshops that: 1) identifies a process model for using workshops; 2) describes a structure of what happens within effective workshops; 3) recommends 25 actionable guidelines for future workshops; and 4) presents an example workshop and workshop methods. The creation of this framework exemplifies the use of critical reflection to learn about visualization in practice from diverse studies and experience.","article_number":"8440830","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440830","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440830/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440830/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"748","end_page":"758","citing_paper_count":39,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1462,"insert_date":"20180820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Conferences","Data visualization","Visualization","Collaboration","Stakeholders","Creativity"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["User-centered visualization design","design studies","creativity workshops","critically reflective practice"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Process Model","Vision Research","Use Of Reflection","Supplemental Material","Processing Methods","Processing Method","Data Visualization","Design Process","Design Method","Design Methods","Collective Experience","Level Of Interest","Design Decisions","Experiential Knowledge","Convergence Of Method","Convergent Methods","Audit Trail","Interesting Idea","Level Of Challenge","Series Of Workshops","Visual Design","Wishful Thinking","Creative Problem Solving","End Of The Workshop","End Of Each Workshop","Visual Methodology","Promising Idea","Mindset","Mentalizing","Software Requirements","Secondary Contribution"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865142","title":"Glanceable Visualization: Studies of Data Comparison Performance on Smartwatches","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":36,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Inria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085671312","id":37085671312,"full_name":"Tanja Blascheck","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Inria"]}},{"affiliation":"Université Paris Saclay","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085906961","id":37085906961,"full_name":"Lonni Besançon","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Université Paris Saclay"]}},{"affiliation":"Université Paris Sud, Université Paris Saclay","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267832500","id":37267832500,"full_name":"Anastasia Bezerianos","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Université Paris Sud, Université Paris Saclay"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37293389400","id":37293389400,"full_name":"Bongshin Lee","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Inria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591317800","id":37591317800,"full_name":"Petra Isenberg","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Inria"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present the results of two perception studies to assess how quickly people can perform a simple data comparison task for small-scale visualizations on a smartwatch.

Previous work has shown that a vast majority of smartwatch interactions last under 5 s. It is still unknown what people can actually perceive from visualizations during such short glances, in particular with such a limited display space of smartwatches. To shed light on this question, we conducted two perception studies that assessed the lower bounds of task time for a simple data comparison task. We tested three chart types common on smartwatches: bar charts, donut charts, and radial bar charts with three different data sizes: 7, 12, and 24 data values. In our first study, we controlled the differences of the two target bars to be compared, while the second study varied the difference randomly. For both studies, we found that participants performed the task on average in <300 ms for the bar chart, <220 ms for the donut chart, and in < 1780 ms for the radial bar chart. Thresholds in the second study per chart type were on average 1.14-1.35× higher than in the first study. Our results show that bar and donut charts should be preferred on smartwatch displays when quick data comparisons are necessary.","article_number":"8443125","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8443125","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8443125/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8443125/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"630","end_page":"640","citing_paper_count":38,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1672,"insert_date":"20180821","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Bars","Task analysis","Visualization","Human computer interaction","Indexes"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Glanceable visualization","smartwatch","perception","quantitative evaluation","data comparison"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Simple Task","Bar Charts","Simple Comparison","Quick Comparison","Chart Types","Error Rate","Correct Responses","Line-of-sight","Line Of Sight","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Viewing Angle","Black Dots","Random Data","Colorblind","Color Blindness","Colour-blind","Color Vision Deficiency","Read Information","Termination Criterion","Termination Criteria","Time Threshold","Grid Lines","Reversal Points","Opposite Point","Chocolate Bars","Simple Visualization","Quick Glance","Display Size","Wrist-worn Devices","Field Of Human-computer Interaction","Field Of Human Computer Interaction","User Datagram Protocol"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865043","title":"RegressionExplorer: Interactive Exploration of Logistic Regression Models with Subgroup Analysis","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":37,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, Eindhoven, Noord-Brabant, NL","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086546004","id":37086546004,"full_name":"Dennis Dingen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, Eindhoven, Noord-Brabant, NL"]}},{"affiliation":"Catharina Hospital Eindhoven","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086545262","id":37086545262,"full_name":"Marcel van't Veer","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Catharina Hospital Eindhoven"]}},{"affiliation":"Catharina Hospital Eindhoven","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38228485000","id":38228485000,"full_name":"Patrick Houthuizen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Catharina Hospital Eindhoven"]}},{"affiliation":"Catharina Hospital Eindhoven","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086545764","id":37086545764,"full_name":"Eveline H.

Building on a review of the human olfactory system and mirroring common visualization practice, we propose olfactory marks, the substrate in which they exist, and their olfactory channels that are available to designers. To exemplify this idea, we present viScent: A six-scent stereo olfactory display capable of conveying olfactory glyphs of varying temperature and direction, as well as a corresponding software system that integrates the display with a traditional visualization display. Finally, we present three applications that make use of the viScent system: A 2D graph visualization, a 2D line and point chart, and an immersive analytics graph visualization in 3D virtual reality.

Our approach visualizes the model-space of our novel incremental hierarchical topic modeling algorithm, unveiling its inner-workings. We support the active incorporation of the user's domain knowledge in every step through explicit model manipulation interactions. In addition, users can initialize the model with expected topic seeds, the backbone priors. For a more targeted optimization, the modeling process automatically triggers a speculative execution of various optimization strategies, and requests feedback whenever the measured model quality deteriorates. Users compare the proposed optimizations to the current model state and preview their effect on the next model iterations, before applying one of them.

The existing evaluations of designs that facilitate these comparisons tend to be based on intuitive reasoning, rather than quantifiable measures. We build on this work with a series of crowdsourced experiments that use low-level perceptual comparison tasks that arise frequently in comparisons within data visualizations (e.g., which value changes the most between the two sets of data?). Participants completed these tasks across a variety of layouts: overlaid, two arrangements of juxtaposed small multiples, mirror-symmetric small multiples, and animated transitions. A staircase procedure sought the difficulty level (e.g., value change delta) that led to equivalent accuracy for each layout. Confirming prior intuition, we observe high levels of performance for overlaid versus standard small multiples. However, we also find performance improvements for both mirror symmetric small multiples and animated transitions. While some results are incongruent with common wisdom in data visualization, they align with previous work in perceptual psychology, and thus have potentially strong implications for visual comparison designs.","article_number":"8440856","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440856","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440856/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440856/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"861","end_page":"871","citing_paper_count":36,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1507,"insert_date":"20180820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Task analysis","Visualization","Data visualization","Correlation","Bars","Layout","Mirrors"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Graphical perception","visual perception","visual comparison","crowdsourced evaluation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Comparison","Data Visualization","Mirror Symmetry","Symmetry Plane","Reflection Symmetry","Mirror-symmetric","Visual Design","Magnitude Of Differences","Series Data","Visual System","Human Microbiome","Human Microbiota","Normal Flora","Visual Features","Visual Characteristics","Visual Task","Direction Of Motion","Bar Charts","Floor Effects","Types Of Arrangements","Type Of Place","Single Series","Multiple Series","Standard Chart","Primitive Features","Primitive Characters","Titer Values","Experiment 1a","Chart Types","Horizontal Arrangement","Horizontal Placement","Staircase Method","Staircase Methods","Within-subjects ANOVA","Within-subjects ANOVAs","Maximum Titer","Treemap","Tree Map","Functional Tree","Performance Of Trees","Time Series","Time-series"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865138","title":"Evaluating ‘Graphical Perception’ with CNNs","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":41,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Harvard University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085514618","id":37085514618,"full_name":"Daniel Haehn","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University"]}},{"affiliation":"Brown University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38234180400","id":38234180400,"full_name":"James Tompkin","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Brown University"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275698100","id":37275698100,"full_name":"Hanspeter Pfister","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Convolutional neural networks can successfully perform many computer vision tasks on images.

Most of the existing methods find anomalous executions based on the properties of individual functions, such as execution time. However, it is insufficient to identify abnormal behavior without taking into account the context of the executions, such as the invocations of children functions and the communications with other HPC nodes. We improve upon the existing anomaly detection approaches by utilizing the call stack structures of the executions, which record rich temporal and contextual information. With our call stack tree (CSTree) representation of the executions, we formulate the anomaly detection problem as finding anomalous tree structures in a call stack forest. The CSTrees are converted to vector representations using our proposed stack2vec embedding. Structural and temporal visualizations of CSTrees are provided to support users in the identification and verification of the anomalies during an active anomaly detection process. Three case studies of real-world HPC applications demonstrate the capabilities of our approach.","article_number":"8440859","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440859","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440859/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440859/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"215","end_page":"224","citing_paper_count":33,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1468,"insert_date":"20180820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Vegetation","Anomaly detection","Labeling","Runtime","Forestry","Visualization","Kernel"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Call Stack","Performance Visualization","Representation Learning","Active Learning","Anomaly Detection"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["High-performance Computing","Supercomputer","High Performance Computing Applications","High-performance Computing Applications","Temporal Information","Tree Structure","Tree-structured","Vector Representation","Anomaly Detection","Anomalous Behavior","Anomalous Behaviour","Tree Representation","Convolutional Neural Network","Scatter Plot","Active Learning","Negative Scores","Popular Approach","Latent Space","Embedding Space","Functional Sequences","Outlier Detection","Decision Boundary","Time Axis","Importance Scores","High Performance Computing Cluster","High-performance Computing Cluster","Anomaly Score","Graph Kernel","Message Passing","Communication Delay","Interview Sessions","Vertex Labels","Graph Labels","Visual Approach","Function Of Interest","Directed Graph","Directed Edge"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865235","title":"Multiple Coordinated Views at Large Displays for Multiple Users: Empirical Findings on User Behavior, Movements, and Distances","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":43,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Sachsen, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086253091","id":37086253091,"full_name":"Ricardo Langner","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Sachsen, DE"]}},{"affiliation":"Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Sachsen, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543510","id":37086543510,"full_name":"Ulrike Kister","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Sachsen, DE"]}},{"affiliation":"Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Sachsen, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37313321900","id":37313321900,"full_name":"Raimund Dachselt","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Sachsen, DE"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Interactive wall-sized displays benefit data visualization.

We also developed a fully functional application with more than 45 coordinated views visualizing a real-world, multivariate data set of crime activities, which we used in a comprehensive qualitative user study investigating how pairs of users behave. Most importantly, we found that flexible movement is essential and—depending on user goals—is connected to collaboration, perception, and interaction. Therefore, we argue that for future systems interaction from the distance is required and needs good support. We show that our consistent design for both direct touch at the large display and distant interaction using mobile phones enables the seamless exploration of large-scale MCV at wall-sized displays. Our MCV application builds on design aspects such as simplicity, flexibility, and visual consistency and, therefore, supports realistic workflows.

An appropriate color mapping is also an important parameter for the creation of an aesthetically pleasing scatterplot. Currently, users of visualization software routinely rely on color mappings that have been pre-defined by the software. A default color mapping, however, cannot ensure an optimal perceptual separability between groups, and sometimes may even lead to a misinterpretation of the data. In this paper, we present an effective approach for color assignment based on a set of given colors that is designed to optimize the perception of scatterplots. Our approach takes into account the spatial relationships, density, degree of overlap between point clusters, and also the background color. For this purpose, we use a genetic algorithm that is able to efficiently find good color assignments. We implemented an interactive color assignment system with three extensions of the basic method that incorporates top $K$ suggestions, user-defined color subsets, and classes of interest for the optimization. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our assignment technique, we conducted a numerical study and a controlled user study to compare our approach with default color assignments; our findings were verified by two expert studies. The results show that our approach is able to support users in distinguishing cluster numbers faster and more precisely than default assignment methods.","article_number":"8440853","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440853","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440853/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440853/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"820","end_page":"829","citing_paper_count":32,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1177,"insert_date":"20180820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image color analysis","Visualization","Data visualization","Task analysis","Genetic algorithms","Optimization","Tools"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Color perception","visual design","scatterplots"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Class Separation","Color Assignment","Color Map","Semantic","Objective Function","Laboratory Studies","Clustering Algorithm","Final Value","Class Labels","Class Structure","Color Difference","Separate Measurements","Colorblind","Neighboring Points","Degree Of Separation","Subjective Preferences","Unique Color","Color Palette","Points In Class","Optimal Assignment","Nearest Neighbor Graph","Color Factor","Medium Color"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865139","title":"Structure-Based Suggestive Exploration: A New Approach for Effective Exploration of Large Networks","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":45,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, CN","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37291847800","id":37291847800,"full_name":"Wei Chen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, CN"]}},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, CN","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085757361","id":37085757361,"full_name":"Fangzhou Guo","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, CN"]}},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, CN","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086544180","id":37086544180,"full_name":"Dongming Han","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, CN"]}},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, CN","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086544319","id":37086544319,"full_name":"Jacheng Pan","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, CN"]}},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, CN","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086544675","id":37086544675,"full_name":"Xiaotao Nie","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, CN"]}},{"affiliation":"Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, CN","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37531405500","id":37531405500,"full_name":"Jiazhi Xia","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, CN"]}},{"affiliation":"Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547462","id":37086547462,"full_name":"Xiaolong Zhang","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, US"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"When analyzing a visualized network, users need to explore different sections of the network to gain insight. However, effective exploration of large networks is often a challenge. While various tools are available for users to explore the global and local features of a network, these tools usually require significant interaction activities, such as repetitive navigation actions to follow network nodes and edges. In this paper, we propose a structure-based suggestive exploration approach to support effective exploration of large networks by suggesting appropriate structures upon user request. Encoding nodes with vectorized representations by transforming information of surrounding structures of nodes into a high dimensional space, our approach can identify similar structures within a large network, enable user interaction with multiple similar structures simultaneously, and guide the exploration of unexplored structures. We develop a web-based visual exploration system to incorporate this suggestive exploration approach and compare performances of our approach under different vectorizing methods and networks. We also present the usability and effectiveness of our approach through a controlled user study with two datasets.","article_number":"8440813","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440813","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440813/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440813/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"555","end_page":"565","citing_paper_count":32,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1442,"insert_date":"20180820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Navigation","Engines","History","Tools","Systems support","Layout"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Large Network Exploration","Structure-Based Exploration","Suggestive Exploration"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Large Networks","Exploration Of Networks","Exploration Of Large Networks","High-dimensional","High-dimensional Space","User Study","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Multiple Structures","Vector Representation","Visual Exploration","Exploration Of Structure","Time Complexity","Vector Space","Precision And Recall","Selective Modulators","Interesting Patterns","Pattern Of Involvement","Network Representation","Visualization Techniques","Matrix Representation","Set Of Networks","Feature-based Methods","Feature-based Method","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Cluster Nodes","Query Time","Synthetic Networks","Kernel Methods","Kernel Machine","Kernel Method","Kernel Trick","Query Results","Trade Patterns","Bitcoin","Interactive Exploration"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865022","title":"VIS Author Profiles: Interactive Descriptions of Publication Records Combining Text and Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":46,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Universitat Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Nordrhein-Westfalen, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085662755","id":37085662755,"full_name":"Shahid Latif","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universitat Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Nordrhein-Westfalen, DE"]}},{"affiliation":"Universitat Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Nordrhein-Westfalen, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586060300","id":37586060300,"full_name":"Fabian Beck","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universitat Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Nordrhein-Westfalen, DE"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Publication records and collaboration networks are important for assessing the expertise and experience of researchers.

It integrates the process of writing data visualization code with description of the design choices that led to the implementation (design exposition). We develop a model of design exposition characterised by four visualization designer architypes: the evaluator, the autonomist, the didacticist and the rationalist. The model is used to justify the key characteristics of literate visualization: ‘notebook’ documents that integrate live coding input, rendered output and textual narrative; low cost of authoring textual narrative; guidelines to encourage structured visualization design and its documentation. We propose narrative schemas for structuring and validating a wide range of visualization design approaches and models, and branching narratives for capturing alternative designs and design views. We describe a new open source literate visualization environment, litvis, based on a declarative interface to Vega and Vega-Lite through the functional programming language Elm combined with markdown for formatted narrative. We informally assess the approach, its implementation and potential by considering three examples spanning a range of design abstractions: new visualization idioms; validation though visualization algebra; and feminist data visualization. We argue that the rich documentation of the design process provided by literate visualization offers the potential to improve the validity of visualization design and so benefit both academic visualization and visualization practice.","article_number":"8440080","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440080","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440080/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440080/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"759","end_page":"768","citing_paper_count":31,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1186,"insert_date":"20180819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Programming","Encoding","Documentation","Couplings"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["storytelling","design","literate programming","theory"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Design Process","Programming Language","Algebra","Algebras","Archetype","Design Choices","Proxemics","Body In Space","Visual Code","Visual Environment","Visual Design","Narrative Text","Narrative Strategies","Process Model","Rational Design","Design Principles","Source Code","Data Compression","Visual Processing","Scoping","Programming Environment","Lack Of Guidance","User Feedback","Collection Of Papers","Document Collection","Visual Approach","Use Of Narratives","Code Blocks","Arts Programs","Design Options","Visual Context","Code Execution","Low Friction"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864913","title":"A Framework for Externalizing Implicit Error Using Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":48,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085621040","id":37085621040,"full_name":"Nina Mccurdy","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543367","id":37086543367,"full_name":"Julie Gerdes","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, US"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564728700","id":37564728700,"full_name":"Miriah Meyer","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, US"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"This paper presents a framework for externalizing and analyzing expert knowledge about discrepancies in data through the use of visualization. Grounded in an 18-month design study with global health experts, the framework formalizes the notion of data discrepancies as implicit error, both in global health data and more broadly. We use the term implicit error to describe measurement error that is inherent to and pervasive throughout a dataset, but that isn't explicitly accounted for or defined. Instead, implicit error exists in the minds of experts, is mainly qualitative, and is accounted for subjectively during expert interpretation of the data. Externalizing knowledge surrounding implicit error can assist in synchronizing, validating, and enhancing interpretation, and can inform error analysis and mitigation. The framework consists of a description of implicit error components that are important for downstream analysis, along with a process model for externalizing and analyzing implicit error using visualization. As a second contribution, we provide a rich, reflective, and verifiable description of our research process as an exemplar summary toward the ongoing inquiry into ways of increasing the validity and transferability of design study research.","article_number":"8449328","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8449328","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8449328/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8449328/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"925","end_page":"935","citing_paper_count":30,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":873,"insert_date":"20180828","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Tools","Data visualization","Public healthcare","Surveillance","Diseases","Visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["implicit error","knowledge externalization","design study"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Global Health","Process Model","Expert Knowledge","Error Analysis","Rich Description","Data Discrepancies","Description Of Components","Description Of Each Component","Global Experts","Visual System","Sources Of Error","Response Data","Visualization Tool","Error Data","Tacit Knowledge","Implicit Knowledge","Embodied Knowledge","Domain Experts","Public Health Surveillance","Syndromic Surveillance","Clinical Surveillance","Understanding Of The Problem","Contextual Knowledge","Cognitive Context","Response Efforts","Nature Of Errors","World Health Organization Data","Extent Of Error","Zika Virus","Pipeline Stages","Zika Outbreak","Choropleth","Impact Of Outbreak","Conceptual Information","University Of Utah"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865159","title":"Dynamic Composite Data Physicalization Using Wheeled Micro-Robots","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":49,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Stanford University, Stanford, CA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543281","id":37086543281,"full_name":"Mathieu Le Goc","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Stanford University, Stanford, CA, US"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, CA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077505300","id":37077505300,"full_name":"Charles Perin","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, CA"]}},{"affiliation":"Stanford University, Stanford, CA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085667725","id":37085667725,"full_name":"Sean Follmer","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Stanford University, Stanford, CA, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Inria, Le Chesnay, ÃŽle-de-France, FR","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407972900","id":37407972900,"full_name":"Jean-Daniel Fekete","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Inria, Le Chesnay, ÃŽle-de-France, FR"]}},{"affiliation":"Inria, Le Chesnay, ÃŽle-de-France, FR","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590932700","id":37590932700,"full_name":"Pierre Dragicevic","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Inria, Le Chesnay, ÃŽle-de-France, FR"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"This paper introduces dynamic composite physicalizations, a new class of physical visualizations that use collections of self-propelled objects to represent data.

Thus, it is vital to select the algorithm appropriately. To systematically select the algorithms, ensemble analysis techniques have been developed to support the assembly and comparison of heterogeneous algorithms. However, challenges remain due to the absence of the ground truth, interpretation, or evaluation of these anomaly detectors. In this paper, we present a visual analytics system named EnsembleLens that evaluates anomaly detection algorithms based on the ensemble analysis process. The system visualizes the ensemble processes and results by a set of novel visual designs and multiple coordinated contextual views to meet the requirements of correlation analysis, assessment and reasoning of anomaly detection algorithms. We also introduce an interactive analysis workflow that dynamically produces contextualized and interpretable data summaries that allow further refinements of exploration results based on user feedback. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EnsembleLens through a quantitative evaluation, three case studies with real-world data and interviews with two domain experts.","article_number":"8440102","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440102","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440102/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440102/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"109","end_page":"119","citing_paper_count":30,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1408,"insert_date":"20180819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Anomaly detection","Correlation","Data visualization","Detectors","Visual analytics","Feature extraction"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Algorithm Evaluation","Ensemble Analysis","Anomaly Detection","Visual Analysis","Multidimensional Data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Multidimensional Data","Multidimensional Analysis","Anomaly Detection","Visual Exploration","Anomaly Detection Algorithm","Interactive","Visual System","Properties Of Data","Data Attributes","Domain Experts","User Feedback","Choice Of Algorithm","Visual Design","Ensemble Analysis","Ensemble Results","Raw Data","Detection Results","Macro Level","Evaluation Of Algorithms","Rate Algorithm","Ranked List","Color Scheme","Colour Scheme","Intrusion Detection","Feature Subspace","Visual Reasoning","Anomaly Score","Pair Of Components","Baseline Algorithms","Ensemble Data","Exploration Algorithm","UCI Machine Learning Repository","Parallel Coordinates","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865233","title":"Mitigating the Attraction Effect with Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":51,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"ISIR","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085898406","id":37085898406,"full_name":"Evanthia Dimara","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["ISIR","INRIA"]}},{"affiliation":"ISIR","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37408293000","id":37408293000,"full_name":"Gilles Bailly","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["ISIR"]}},{"affiliation":"Univ.

Bias mitigation strategies often focus on the person, by educating people about their biases, typically with little success. We focus instead on the system, presenting the first evidence that altering the design of an interactive visualization tool can mitigate a strong bias - the attraction effect. Participants viewed 2D scatterplots where choices between superior alternatives were affected by the placement of other suboptimal points. We found that highlighting the superior alternatives weakened the bias, but did not eliminate it. We then tested an interactive approach where participants completely removed locally dominated points from the view, inspired by the elimination by aspects strategy in the decision-making literature. This approach strongly decreased the bias, leading to a counterintuitive suggestion: tools that allow removing inappropriately salient or distracting data from a view may help lead users to make more rational decisions.","article_number":"8440809","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440809","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440809/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440809/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"850","end_page":"860","citing_paper_count":29,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1127,"insert_date":"20180820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Training","Decision making","Cognition","Visualization","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Decision making","cognitive bias","bias alleviation","bias mitigation","debiasing","information visualization","attraction effect"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Magnetic Effect","Attraction Effect","Decision-making","Decision Making","Data Visualization","Visualization Tool","Interactive Visualization","Rational Decision","Visual System","Target Location","Target Position","Baseline Condition","Baseline Status","Baseline State","Cognitive Biases","Cognitive Bias","Decision Support System","Decision System","Optimal Choice","Black Dots","Choice Task","Decision Task","Statistical Hypothesis","Pareto Front","Pareto Frontier","Confirmation Bias","Original Experiment","Decision Strategy","Decision Scheme","Lottery Tickets","Crowdsourcing Platforms","Experimental Rationale","Rationale For These Experiments"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865230","title":"NLIZE: A Perturbation-Driven Visual Interrogation Tool for Analyzing and Interpreting Natural Language Inference Models","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":52,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38025553600","id":38025553600,"full_name":"Shusen Liu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086546413","id":37086546413,"full_name":"Zhimin Li","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SCI Institute, University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computing, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086545156","id":37086545156,"full_name":"Tao Li","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computing, University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computing, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38467245000","id":38467245000,"full_name":"Vivek Srikumar","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computing, University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284312600","id":37284312600,"full_name":"Valerio Pascucci","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SCI Institute, University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564112000","id":37564112000,"full_name":"Peer-Timo Bremer","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"With the recent advances in deep learning, neural network models have obtained state-of-the-art performances for many linguistic tasks in natural language processing.

However, the existing techniques cannot satisfactorily support the analysis tasks involved in ranking large-scale spatial alternatives, such as selecting optimal locations for chain stores, where the complex spatial contexts involved are essential to the decision-making process. Limitations observed in the prior attempts of integrating rankings with spatial contexts motivate us to develop a context-integrated visual ranking technique. Based on a set of generic design requirements we summarized by collaborating with domain experts, we propose SRVis, a novel spatial ranking visualization technique that supports efficient spatial multi-criteria decision-making processes by addressing three major challenges in the aforementioned context integration, namely, a) the presentation of spatial rankings and contexts, b) the scalability of rankings' visual representations, and c) the analysis of context-integrated spatial rankings. Specifically, we encode massive rankings and their cause with scalable matrix-based visualizations and stacked bar charts based on a novel two-phase optimization framework that minimizes the information loss, and the flexible spatial filtering and intuitive comparative analysis are adopted to enable the in-depth evaluation of the rankings and assist users in selecting the best spatial alternative. The effectiveness of the proposed technique has been evaluated and demonstrated with an empirical study of optimization methods, two case studies, and expert interviews.","article_number":"8456575","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8456575","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8456575/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8456575/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"459","end_page":"469","citing_paper_count":28,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1402,"insert_date":"20180906","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Bars","Decision making","Data visualization","Scalability","Spatial databases","Reliability"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Spatial ranking","visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive","Scalable","Decision-making Process","Decision Process","Visual Representation","Bar Charts","Domain Experts","Spatial Processing","Spatial Context","Spatial Filter","Visualization Techniques","Multiple Criteria","Multi-criteria Decision-making","Multi-criteria Decision Making","Multi-criteria Decision Analysis","Expert Interviews","Rank Analysis","Stacked Bar","Spatial Visualization","Chain Stores","Stacked Bar Charts","Nonlinear Model","Ranking Of Alternatives","Ranked Set","Number Of Alternatives","Circular Map","Rank Of Matrix","Group Of Rank","Geospatial Analysis","Rank Distribution","Unit Price","Criteria Weights","Criterion Weights"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865234","title":"Visualizing Ranges over Time on Mobile Phones: A Task-Based Crowdsourced Evaluation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":54,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37719161300","id":37719161300,"full_name":"Matthew Brehmer","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37293389400","id":37293389400,"full_name":"Bongshin Lee","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Inria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591317800","id":37591317800,"full_name":"Petra Isenberg","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Inria"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland at College Park, College Park, MD, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085751692","id":37085751692,"full_name":"Eun Kyoung Choe","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland at College Park, College Park, MD, US"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In the first crowdsourced visualization experiment conducted exclusively on mobile phones, we compare approaches to visualizing ranges over time on small displays. People routinely consume such data via a mobile phone, from temperatures in weather forecasting apps to sleep and blood pressure readings in personal health apps. However, we lack guidance on how to effectively visualize ranges on small displays in the context of different value retrieval and comparison tasks, or with respect to different data characteristics such as periodicity, seasonality, or the cardinality of ranges. Central to our experiment is a comparison between two ways to lay out ranges: a more conventional linear layout strikes a balance between quantitative and chronological scale resolution, while a less conventional radial layout emphasizes the cyclicality of time and may prioritize discrimination between values at its periphery. With results from 87 crowd workers, we found that while participants completed tasks more quickly with linear layouts than with radial ones, there were few differences in terms of error rate between layout conditions. We also found that participants performed similarly with both layouts in tasks that involved comparing superimposed observed and average ranges.","article_number":"8440812","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440812","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440812/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440812/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"619","end_page":"629","citing_paper_count":27,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1130,"insert_date":"20180820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Mobile handsets","Temperature distribution","Layout","Task analysis","Encoding","Meteorology"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Evaluation","graphical perception","mobile phones","range visualization","crowdsourcing"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Mobile Phone","Crowdsourcing","Weather","Error Rate","Health Apps","Health App","Comparison Task","Quantitative Scale","Data Sources","Temperature Range","Mobile Devices","Portable Devices","Mobile App","Mobile Application","Smartphone Application","Smartphone App","Mobile Apps","Smartphone Apps","Temperature Data","Linear Range","Completion Time","Daily Temperature","Experimental Task","Level Of Granularity","Starting Values","Sleep Data","Sleep Group","Visual Encoding","Combination Of Tasks","Sleep Schedule","Temporal Granularity","Average Values Range","Affect Task Performance","Subjective Responses","Max Values","Aspect Ratio"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864848","title":"Shared-Memory Parallel Computation of Morse-Smale Complexes with Improved Accuracy","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":55,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37870001700","id":37870001700,"full_name":"Attila Gyulassy","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564112000","id":37564112000,"full_name":"Peer-Timo Bremer","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA, US"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284312600","id":37284312600,"full_name":"Valerio Pascucci","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, US"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Topological techniques have proven to be a powerful tool in the analysis and visualization of large-scale scientific data. In particular, the Morse-Smale complex and its various components provide a rich framework for robust feature definition and computation. Consequently, there now exist a number of approaches to compute Morse-Smale complexes for large-scale data in parallel. However, existing techniques are based on discrete concepts which produce the correct topological structure but are known to introduce grid artifacts in the resulting geometry. Here, we present a new approach that combines parallel streamline computation with combinatorial methods to construct a high-quality discrete Morse-Smale complex. In addition to being invariant to the orientation of the underlying grid, this algorithm allows users to selectively build a subset of features using high-quality geometry. In particular, a user may specifically select which ascending/descending manifolds are reconstructed with improved accuracy, focusing computational effort where it matters for subsequent analysis. This approach computes Morse-Smale complexes for larger data than previously feasible with significant speedups. We demonstrate and validate our approach using several examples from a variety of different scientific domains, and evaluate the performance of our method.","article_number":"8440824","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440824","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440824/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440824/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"1183","end_page":"1192","citing_paper_count":27,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":541,"insert_date":"20180820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Geometry","Manifolds","Feature extraction","Robustness","Isosurfaces","Tools"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Morse complex","Parallel Computation","Topology","Accurate Geometry"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Parallelization","Parallel Computing","Manifold","Streamline","Computational Robustness","Robust Calculation","Discrete Complexes","Numeric","Critical Point","Running Time","Gradient Descent","Steepest Descent","Vector Field","Discrete Set","Isolated Points","Atoms In Molecules","QTAIM","Continuous Line","Field Gradient","Volumetric Data","Mesh Cell","Boundary Map","Increase In Runtime","Quantum Theory Of Atoms","Steepest Gradient","Discrete Field","Bond Paths","Corner Cube","Accurate Geometry","Practical Use Cases","Regular Grid","Cartesian Grid","Grid Structure","Rectangular Grid","Boundary Region","Discrete Algorithm","Parallel Algorithm","Hexahedral","Hexahedron"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864899","title":"iStoryline: Effective Convergence to Hand-drawn Storylines","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":56,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, CN","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543321","id":37086543321,"full_name":"Tan Tang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, CN"]}},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, CN","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086546327","id":37086546327,"full_name":"Sadia Rubab","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, CN"]}},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, CN","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086545004","id":37086545004,"full_name":"Jiewen Lai","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, CN"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37391623900","id":37391623900,"full_name":"Weiwei Cui","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, Groningen, Groningen, NL","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593898200","id":37593898200,"full_name":"Lingyun Yu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, Groningen, Groningen, NL"]}},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, CN","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","id":37407308300,"full_name":"Yingcai Wu","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, CN"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Storyline visualization techniques have progressed significantly to generate illustrations of complex stories automatically. However, the visual layouts of storylines are not enhanced accordingly despite the improvement in the performance and extension of its application area. Existing methods attempt to achieve several shared optimization goals, such as reducing empty space and minimizing line crossings and wiggles. However, these goals do not always produce optimal results when compared to hand-drawn storylines. We conducted a preliminary study to learn how users translate a narrative into a hand-drawn storyline and check whether the visual elements in hand-drawn illustrations can be mapped back to appropriate narrative contexts. We also compared the hand-drawn storylines with storylines generated by the state-of-the-art methods and found they have significant differences. Our findings led to a design space that summarizes 1) how artists utilize narrative elements and 2) the sequence of actions artists follow to portray expressive and attractive storylines. We developed iStoryline, an authoring tool for integrating high-level user interactions into optimization algorithms and achieving a balance between hand-drawn storylines and automatic layouts. iStoryline allows users to create novel storyline visualizations easily according to their preferences by modifying the automatically generated layouts. The effectiveness and usability of iStoryline are studied with qualitative evaluations.","article_number":"8440828","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440828","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440828/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440828/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"769","end_page":"778","citing_paper_count":27,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1337,"insert_date":"20180820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Layout","Tools","Motion pictures","Optimization methods","Guidelines"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Hand-drawn illustrations","automatic layout","design space","interactions","optimization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Design Space","Visual Elements","Optimization Goal","Narrative Elements","Narrative Context","Interactive","Creativity","Creative Thinking","Rational Design","Design Principles","Digital Media","Online Media","Automatic Method","Automatic Methods","Set Of Interactions","Emotional Changes","Constrained Optimization","Optimization Constraints","Constrained Minimization","Interaction Design","White Space","Visual Design","Straightness","Narrative Events","Effects Of Narratives","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Affective Elements","Original Narrative","Mental Maps","Pathlines","Design Pipeline","Two-stage Study","Effective Representation","Design Considerations","Line Segment"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865144","title":"Vistrates: A Component Model for Ubiquitous Analytics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":57,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Maryland at College Park, College Park, MD, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085388100","id":37085388100,"full_name":"Sriram Karthik Badam","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland at College Park, College Park, MD, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Aarhus Universitet, Aarhus, DK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085776362","id":37085776362,"full_name":"Andreas Mathisen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Aarhus Universitet, Aarhus, DK"]}},{"affiliation":"Aarhus Universitet, Aarhus, DK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086529722","id":37086529722,"full_name":"Roman Rädle","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Aarhus Universitet, Aarhus, DK"]}},{"affiliation":"Aarhus Universitet, Aarhus, DK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38304562900","id":38304562900,"full_name":"Clemens N.

In this paper, we present a component model design for data visualization to promote modular designs of visualization tools that enhance their analytical scope. Rather than fragmenting tasks across tools, the component model supports unification, where components—the building blocks of this model—can be assembled to support a wide range of tasks. Furthermore, the model also provides additional key properties, such as support for collaboration, sharing across multiple devices, and adaptive usage depending on expertise, from creating visualizations using dropdown menus, through instantiating components, to actually modifying components or creating entirely new ones from scratch using JavaScript or Python source code. To realize our model, we introduce Vistrates, a literate computing platform for developing, assembling, and sharing visualization components. From a visualization perspective, Vistrates features cross-cutting components for visual representations, interaction, collaboration, and device responsiveness maintained in a component repository. From a development perspective, Vistrates offers a collaborative programming environment where novices and experts alike can compose component pipelines for specific analytical activities. Finally, we present several Vistrates use cases that span the full range of the classic “anytime” and “anywhere” motto for ubiquitous analysis: from mobile and on-the-go usage, through office settings, to collaborative smart environments covering a variety of tasks and devices.","article_number":"8440803","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440803","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440803/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440803/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"586","end_page":"596","citing_paper_count":27,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":824,"insert_date":"20180820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Tools","Collaboration","Media","Substrates","Task analysis","Data analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Components","literate computing","development","exploration","dissemination","collaboration","heterogeneous devices"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Model Components","Data Visualization","Visualization Tool","Multiple Devices","Visual Components","Synchronization","Synchronous","Mobile Devices","Portable Devices","Visual Analysis","Graphical User Interface","Graphical Interface","Level Of Abstraction","Multiple Users","Multiple Use","Level Of Expertise","Load Data","Data Movement","Web Browser","Function Words","Word Structure","Higher Level Of Abstraction","Visualization Platform","Line Chart","Update Method","Updated Methods","Computation Offloading","Start Node","Heterogeneous Devices","Device Heterogeneity","Multiple Levels Of Abstraction","Web Content","Zoom Level","Interactive Visualization","Core Framework","Bar Charts","Abstraction Layer"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865021","title":"GraphProtector: A Visual Interface for Employing and Assessing Multiple Privacy Preserving Graph Algorithms","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":58,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086258030","id":37086258030,"full_name":"Xumeng Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37291847800","id":37291847800,"full_name":"Wei Chen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085795830","id":37085795830,"full_name":"Jia-Kai Chou","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085724978","id":37085724978,"full_name":"Chris Bryan","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis"]}},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University, Alibaba Group","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085875789","id":37085875789,"full_name":"Huihua Guan","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhejiang University, Alibaba Group"]}},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086249532","id":37086249532,"full_name":"Wenlong Chen","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086542939","id":37086542939,"full_name":"Rusheng Pan","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275869400","id":37275869400,"full_name":"Kwan-Liu Ma","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Analyzing social networks reveals the relationships between individuals and groups in the data.

Text plays a major role in this activity since it represents the bulk of the clinical documentation, but reviewing it quickly becomes onerous when patient charts grow too large. Text visualization methods have been widely explored to manage this large scale through visual summaries that rely on information retrieval algorithms to structure text and make it amenable to visualization. However, the integration with such automated approaches comes with a number of limitations, including significant error rates and the need for healthcare providers to fine-tune algorithms without expert knowledge of their inner mechanics. In addition, several of these approaches obscure or substitute the original clinical text and therefore fail to leverage qualitative and rhetorical flavours of the clinical notes. These drawbacks have limited the adoption of text visualization and other summarization technologies in clinical practice. In this work we present Doccurate, a novel system embodying a curation-based approach for the visualization of large clinical text datasets. Our approach offers automation auditing and customizability to physicians while also preserving and extensively linking to the original text. We discuss findings of a formal qualitative evaluation conducted with 6 domain experts, shedding light onto physicians' information needs, perceived strengths and limitations of automated tools, and the importance of customization while balancing efficiency. We also present use case scenarios to showcase Doccurate's envisioned usage in practice.","article_number":"8440832","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440832","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440832/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440832/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"142","end_page":"151","citing_paper_count":26,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1372,"insert_date":"20180820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Medical services","Visualization","Automation","Data visualization","Tools","Task analysis","Medical diagnostic imaging"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual Curation","Clinical Text","Text Visualization","Medical Narrative"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864839","title":"Time-Dependent Flow seen through Approximate Observer Killing Fields","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":61,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37394809600","id":37394809600,"full_name":"Markus Hadwiger","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia"]}},{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086545548","id":37086545548,"full_name":"Matej Mlejnek","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia"]}},{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086145710","id":37086145710,"full_name":"Thomas Theußl","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia"]}},{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37828701300","id":37828701300,"full_name":"Peter Rautek","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Flow fields are usually visualized relative to a global observer, i.e., a single frame of reference. However, often no global frame can depict all flow features equally well. Likewise, objective criteria for detecting features such as vortices often use either a global reference frame, or compute a separate frame for each point in space and time. We propose the first general framework that enables choosing a smooth trade-off between these two extremes. Using global optimization to minimize specific differential geometric properties, we compute a time-dependent observer velocity field that describes the motion of a continuous field of observers adapted to the input flow. This requires developing the novel notion of an observed time derivative. While individual observers are restricted to rigid motions, overall we compute an approximate Killing field, corresponding to almost-rigid motion. This enables continuous transitions between different observers. Instead of focusing only on flow features, we furthermore develop a novel general notion of visualizing how all observers jointly perceive the input field. This in fact requires introducing the concept of an observation time, with respect to which a visualization is computed. We develop the corresponding notions of observed stream, path, streak, and time lines. For efficiency, these characteristic curves can be computed using standard approaches, by first transforming the input field accordingly. Finally, we prove that the input flow perceived by the observer field is objective. This makes derived flow features, such as vortices, objective as well.","article_number":"8440037","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440037","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440037/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440037/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"1257","end_page":"1266","citing_paper_count":25,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":603,"insert_date":"20180819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Observers","Visualization","Optimization","Standards","Geometry","Feature extraction","Two dimensional displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Flow visualization","observer frames of reference","Killing vector fields","infinitesimal isometries","Lie derivatives","objectivity"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Time-dependent Flow","Time Dependent Flow","Killing Fields","Time And Space","Spacetime","Streamline","Flow Velocity","Flow Speed","Velocity Field","Observation Time","Points In Space","Global Optimization","Time Derivative","Time-derivative","Flow Field","Rigid Transformation","Rigid Motion","Global Frame","Input Field","Pathlines","Time-dependent Field","Time Dependent Field","Fixed Point","Visual Features","Visual Characteristics","Unique Solution","Vector Field","Euclidean Space","Lie Derivative","Flow Visualization","Surface Integrity","Solution Curve","Integral Curves","Steady Field","Differential Geometry","Rigid Rotation","Steady Flow","Unsteady Flow","Term In Eq","Laboratory Frame","Laboratory-frame","Least Squares Solution"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865047","title":"SIRIUS: Dual, Symmetric, Interactive Dimension Reductions","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":62,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086544634","id":37086544634,"full_name":"Michelle Dowling","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233577000","id":38233577000,"full_name":"John Wenskovitch","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086545763","id":37086545763,"full_name":"J.T.

From the analyst's perceptual and cognitive perspective, current visualization approaches typically treat the observations of the high-dimensional dataset very differently from the attributes. Often, the attributes are treated as inputs (e.g., sliders), and observations as outputs (e.g., projection plots), thus emphasizing investigation of the observations. However, there are many cases in which analysts wish to investigate both the observations and the attributes of the dataset, suggesting a symmetry between how analysts think about attributes and observations. To address this, we define SIRIUS (Symmetric Interactive Representations In a Unified System), a symmetric, dual projection technique to support exploratory data analysis of high-dimensional data. We provide an example implementation of SIRIUS and demonstrate how this symmetry affords additional insights.","article_number":"8440814","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440814","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440814/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440814/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"172","end_page":"182","citing_paper_count":25,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1071,"insert_date":"20180820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Task analysis","Data analysis","Animals","Principal component analysis","Visual analytics","Image color analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Dimension reduction","semantic interaction","exploratory data analysis","observation projection","attribute projection"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Exploratory Analysis","Exploratory Data Analysis","Properties Of Data","Data Attributes","Properties Of The Dataset","Attributes In The Dataset","Important Properties","Important Dimension","Important Attributes","Node Size","Visualization Techniques","Node Positions","Location Of Nodes","Dolphins","Value Of Water","Projection Method","Projection Methods","Subset Of Dataset","Named Entity Recognition","Entity Extraction","Named-entity Recognition","Quadrupedal","Attribute Values","German Shepherd","Interaction Techniques","Principal Component Analysis Projection","Alternative Projects","Symmetric Interactions","Blue Whales","Balaenoptera Musculus","Symmetric Manner","High Level Of Importance","High Values","Project Data","Weight Equation","Process Equation","Single Project","Distance Function","Separable Space","Proximity In Space"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865028","title":"Vulnus: Visual Vulnerability Analysis for Network Security","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":63,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Rome “La Sapienza”","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085708091","id":37085708091,"full_name":"Marco Angelini","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Rome “La Sapienza”"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Rome “La Sapienza”","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086546099","id":37086546099,"full_name":"Graziano Blasilli","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Rome “La Sapienza”"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Rome “La Sapienza”","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282732900","id":37282732900,"full_name":"Tiziana Catarci","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Rome “La Sapienza”"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Rome “La Sapienza”","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086128173","id":37086128173,"full_name":"Simone Lenti","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Rome “La Sapienza”"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Rome “La Sapienza”","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283308300","id":37283308300,"full_name":"Giuseppe Santucci","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Rome “La Sapienza”"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Vulnerabilities represent one of the main weaknesses of IT systems and the availability of consolidated official data, like CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures), allows for using them to compute the paths an attacker is likely to follow.

The tree is laid out linearly, which enables us to juxtapose the nodes with a table visualization where diverse attributes can be shown. We also use this table as an adjacency matrix, so that the resulting technique is a hybrid node-link/adjacency matrix technique. We implement this concept in Juniper and complement it with a set of interaction techniques that enable analysts to dynamically grow, restructure, and aggregate the tree, as well as change the layout or show paths between nodes.

Our framework, called Persistence Atlas, enables the visualization of the dominant spatial patterns of critical points, along with statistics regarding their occurrence in the ensemble. The persistence atlas represents in the geometrical domain each dominant pattern in the form of a confidence map for the appearance of critical points. As a by-product, our method also provides 2-dimensional layouts of the entire ensemble, highlighting the main trends at a global level. Our approach is based on the new notion of Persistence Map, a measure of the geometrical density in critical points which leverages the robustness to noise of topological persistence to better emphasize salient features. We show how to leverage spectral embedding to represent the ensemble members as points in a low-dimensional Euclidean space, where distances between points measure the dissimilarities between critical point layouts and where statistical tasks, such as clustering, can be easily carried out. Further, we show how the notion of mandatory critical point can be leveraged to evaluate for each cluster confidence regions for the appearance of critical points. Most of the steps of this framework can be trivially parallelized and we show how to efficiently implement them. Extensive experiments demonstrate the relevance of our approach. The accuracy of the confidence regions provided by the persistence atlas is quantitatively evaluated and compared to a baseline strategy using an off-the-shelf clustering approach. We illustrate the importance of the persistence atlas in a variety of real-life datasets, where clear trends in feature layouts are identified and analyzed. We provide a lightweight VTK-based C++ implementation of our approach that can be used for reproduction purposes.","article_number":"8457259","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8457259","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8457259/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8457259/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"1152","end_page":"1162","citing_paper_count":23,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":419,"insert_date":"20180911","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Market research","Data visualization","Layout","Probability density function","Extraterrestrial measurements","Uncertainty","Robustness"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Topological data analysis","scalar data","ensemble data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Critical Point","Spatial Variation","Interesting Feature","Interesting Characteristics","Clustering Approach","Low-dimensional Space","Lower-dimensional Space","Main Trends","Ensemble Members","Confidence Region","Ensemble Data","Entire Ensemble","C++ Implementation","Variance In The Data","Distance Matrix","Distance Matrices","Probability Density Function","Variation Trend","Point Cloud","Point Clouds","Reynolds Number","Spatial Domain","Noise In Data","Convex Hull","Spectral Clustering","Topological Data Analysis","Probability Of Appearance","Layout Changes","Sublevel Set","Superlevel Sets","Adjacency Graph","Approach Focusing","Focus Of Approaches","Green Region","Saddle Point","Saddle-point","Saddle-node","Space Mapping"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865024","title":"KnowledgePearls: Provenance-Based Visualization Retrieval","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":66,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Johannes Kepler Universitat Linz, Linz, AT","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085497544","id":37085497544,"full_name":"Holger Stitz","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Johannes Kepler Universitat Linz, Linz, AT"]}},{"affiliation":"Johannes Kepler Universitat Linz, Linz, AT","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077342300","id":37077342300,"full_name":"Samuel Gratzl","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Johannes Kepler Universitat Linz, Linz, AT"]}},{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282562500","id":37282562500,"full_name":"Harald Piringer","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VRVis Research Center, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co KG, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547438","id":37086547438,"full_name":"Thomas Zichner","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co KG, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Johannes Kepler Universitat Linz, Linz, AT","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403918900","id":37403918900,"full_name":"Marc Streit","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Johannes Kepler Universitat Linz, Linz, AT"]}}]},"access_type":"CCBY - IEEE is not the copyright holder of this material.

However, without extensive manual creation of meta information and annotations by the users, search and retrieval of analysis states can become tedious. We present KnowledgePearls, a solution for efficient retrieval of analysis states that are structured as provenance graphs containing automatically recorded user interactions and visualizations. As a core component, we describe a visual interface for querying and exploring analysis states based on their similarity to a partial definition of a requested analysis state. Depending on the use case, this definition may be provided explicitly by the user by formulating a search query or inferred from given reference states. We explain our approach using the example of efficient retrieval of demographic analyses by Hans Rosling and discuss our implementation for a fast look-up of previous states. Our approach is independent of the underlying visualization framework. We discuss the applicability for visualizations which are based on the declarative grammar Vega and we use a Vega-based implementation of Gapminder as guiding example. We additionally present a biomedical case study to illustrate how KnowledgePearls facilitates the exploration process by recalling states from earlier analyses.","article_number":"8440831","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440831","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440831/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440831/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"120","end_page":"130","citing_paper_count":21,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1961,"insert_date":"20180820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Indexes","History","Database languages","Knowledge based systems","Grammar"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization provenance","interaction provenance","retrieval"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Reference State","Standard State","Search Queries","Visual Interface","Search Terms","Visual System","Search Results","Similarity Score","Visual Analysis","Relevant Conditions","Relevant States","Property Values","Quality Metrics","Visualization Techniques","Sequence Of States","Visual Properties","Visual Attributes","Temporal Coherence","Side Panel","Stacked Bar","Part Of Future Work","Static Graph","Retrieval Approach","Provenance Information","Proven Track","Selected Search Terms","Information Retrieval Systems","Visual Exploration","Client-side","Client Side","2-tier","Domain Experts","Numerical Values","Relevance Score"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864526","title":"Duet: Helping Data Analysis Novices Conduct Pairwise Comparisons by Minimal Specification","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":67,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085886497","id":37085886497,"full_name":"Po-Ming Law","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37829310200","id":37829310200,"full_name":"Rahul C.

To reduce the barriers in executing low-level operations during pairwise comparison, Duet employs minimal specification: when one object group (i.e. a group of records in a data table) is specified, Duet recommends object groups that are similar to or different from the specified one; when two object groups are specified, Duet recommends similar and different attributes between them. To lower the barriers in interpreting its recommendations, Duet explains the recommended groups and attributes using both visualizations and textual descriptions.

However, in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), as well as in other domains, there are many situations where such a spatial overview is not relevant or practical for users, for example when the experts already have a good mental overview of the data, or when an analysis of a large overall structure may not be related to the specific, information-driven tasks of users. Using scientific workflow theory and, as a vehicle, the problem of viscous finger evolution, we advocate an alternative model that allows domain experts to explore features of interest first, then explore the context around those features, and finally move to a potentially unfamiliar summarization overview. In a model instantiation, we show how a computational back-end can identify and track over time low-level, small features, then be used to filter the context of those features while controlling the complexity of the visualization, and finally to summarize and compare simulations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach with an online web-based exploration of a total volume of data approaching half a billion seven-dimensional data points, and report supportive feedback provided by domain experts with respect to both the instantiation and the theoretical model.","article_number":"8440850","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440850","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440850/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440850/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"1225","end_page":"1235","citing_paper_count":21,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1251,"insert_date":"20180820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Computational modeling","Data visualization","Feature extraction","Context modeling","Tracking","Visualization","Spatiotemporal phenomena"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["theory","visualization design","details-first model","discourse paper","computational fluid dynamics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Ensemble Simulations","Viscous Fingering","Interesting Feature","Interesting Characteristics","Philosophy Of Science","Scientific Theories","Vision Research","Domain Experts","Overview Of Data","Time And Space","Spacetime","Spatial Features","Spatial Characteristics","Spatial Context","Detailed View","Simulation Run","Perspective Of Model","Temporal Context","Concentration Points","Multiple Simulations","Doctoral Research","Visual Design","Human Input","Flow Visualization","Finger Structure","Scientific Visualization","Van Ham","Detailed Use","2D Views","User Side","Cluttering","Hand Tracking","Finger Tracking","Tree Nodes","Precise Definition"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865264","title":"At a Glance: Pixel Approximate Entropy as a Measure of Line Chart Complexity","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":69,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Columbia University, New York, NY, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086435216","id":37086435216,"full_name":"Gabriel Ryan","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Columbia University, New York, NY, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Tufts University, Medford, MA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086545952","id":37086545952,"full_name":"Abigail Mosca","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tufts University, Medford, MA, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Tufts University, Medford, MA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592409400","id":37592409400,"full_name":"Remco Chang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tufts University, Medford, MA, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Columbia University, New York, NY, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086545135","id":37086545135,"full_name":"Eugene Wu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Columbia University, New York, NY, US"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"When inspecting information visualizations under time critical settings, such as emergency response or monitoring the heart rate in a surgery room, the user only has a small amount of time to view the visualization “at a glance”.

In this paper, we seek to facilitate enhanced comprehension of such documents through a contextual visualization technique that couples text content with data tables contained in the document. We parse the text content and data tables, cross-link the components using a keyword-based matching algorithm, and generate on-demand visualizations based on the reader's current focus within a document. We evaluate this technique in a user study comparing our approach to a traditional reading experience.

In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Volume Lines for the interactive visual analysis and comparison of sets of 3D volumes. Each volume is linearized along a Hilbert space-filling curve into a 1D Hilbert line plot, which depicts the intensities over the Hilbert indices. We present a nonlinear scaling of these 1D Hilbert line plots based on the intensity variations in the ensemble of 3D volumes, which enables a more effective use of the available screen space. The nonlinear scaling builds the basis for our interactive visualization techniques. An interactive histogram heatmap of the intensity frequencies serves as overview visualization. When zooming in, the frequencies are replaced by detailed 1D Hilbert line plots and optional functional boxplots. To focus on important regions of the volume ensemble, nonlinear scaling is incorporated into the plots. An interactive scaling widget depicts the local ensemble variations. Our brushing and linking interface reveals, for example, regions with a high ensemble variation by showing the affected voxels in a 3D spatial view. We show the applicability of our concepts using two case studies on ensembles of 3D volumes resulting from tomographic reconstruction. In the first case study, we evaluate an artificial specimen from simulated industrial 3D X-ray computed tomography (XCT). In the second case study, a real-world XCT foam specimen is investigated. Our results show that Dynamic Volume Lines can identify regions with high local intensity variations, allowing the user to draw conclusions, for example, about the choice of reconstruction parameters. Furthermore, it is possible to detect ring artifacts in reconstructions volumes.","article_number":"8440038","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440038","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440038/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440038/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"1040","end_page":"1049","citing_paper_count":19,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":865,"insert_date":"20180819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three-dimensional displays","Visualization","Indexes","Data visualization","Histograms","Two dimensional displays","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Ensemble data","comparative visualization","visual analysis","Hilbert curve","nonlinear scaling","X-ray computed tomography"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Comparison","3D Volume","Space-filling Curve","Space Filling Curves","High Diversity","High Variation","Histogram","Local Variations","Visual Analysis","Line Plots","Interactive Visualization","X-ray Computed Tomography","Ensemble Members","Ring Artifact","Ring Artefacts","Nonlinear Scaling","Screen Space","Dataset Size","3D Space","3-dimensional Space","Line Scan","Reconstruction Algorithm","Domain Experts","Tree Segmentation","Open-cell Foams","Open Cell Foams","Background Regions","Volume Reconstruction","Ensemble Analysis","Regional Volume","Vertical Bars","Vertical Pipe","Vert","Vertex Cover","Node Coverage","N-dimensional Space","Color Map","Colour Map","Colormap"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865049","title":"MotionRugs: Visualizing Collective Trends in Space and Time","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":73,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Universitat Konstanz, Konstanz, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233607000","id":38233607000,"full_name":"Juri Buchmüller","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universitat Konstanz, Konstanz, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, DE"]}},{"affiliation":"Universitat Konstanz, Konstanz, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233561600","id":38233561600,"full_name":"Dominik Jäckle","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universitat Konstanz, Konstanz, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, DE"]}},{"affiliation":"Universitat Konstanz, Konstanz, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085640263","id":37085640263,"full_name":"Eren Cakmak","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universitat Konstanz, Konstanz, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, DE"]}},{"affiliation":"Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule Zurich, Zurich, ZH, CH","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550836200","id":37550836200,"full_name":"Ulrik Brandes","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule Zurich, Zurich, ZH, CH"]}},{"affiliation":"Universitat Konstanz, Konstanz, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","id":37283138700,"full_name":"Daniel A.

The collectives are driven by mutual objectives or react to individual direction changes and external influence factors and stimuli. The challenge in visualizing collective movement data is to show space and time of hundreds of movements at the same time to enable the detection of spatiotemporal patterns. In this paper, we propose MotionRugs, a novel space efficient technique for visualizing moving groups of entities. Building upon established space-partitioning strategies, our approach reduces the spatial dimensions in each time step to a one-dimensional ordered representation of the individual entities. By design, MotionRugs provides an overlap-free, compact overview of the development of group movements over time and thus, enables analysts to visually identify and explore group-specific temporal patterns. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach in the field of fish swarm analysis and report on initial feedback of domain experts from the field of collective behavior.","article_number":"8440823","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440823","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440823/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440823/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"76","end_page":"86","citing_paper_count":19,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1293,"insert_date":"20180820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Trajectory","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Market research","Tracking","Image color analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Spatio-Temporal Visualization","Spatial Abstraction","Spatial Index Structures","Collective Movement"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Time And Space","Spacetime","Trends In Space","Spatial Dimensions","Spatial Attributes","Domain Experts","Collective Behavior","Collective Behaviour","Spatial Partitioning","Partition Of Space","Flocks Of Birds","Group Of Entities","Distribution Characteristics","Feature Distribution","Large Amount Of Data","Feature Values","Characteristic Values","International Development","Global Development","Temporal Dimension","Time Dimension","Temporal Properties","Visual Representation","Identification Of Changes","Color Map","Colour Map","Colormap","Spatial Configuration","Visualization Techniques","Static Approach","Spatiotemporal Data","Dense Representation","Spatial Structure Of The Data","Spatial Index","Spatial Indices","Quadtree","Spatial Order","Identification Of Trends","Spatial Aggregation","Basic Characteristics","Basic Features","Individual Movement"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864806","title":"Interactive 3D Visual Analysis of Atmospheric Fronts","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":74,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Technische Universitat Munchen, Munchen, Bayern, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086255734","id":37086255734,"full_name":"Michael Kern","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technische Universitat Munchen, Munchen, Bayern, DE"]}},{"affiliation":"European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Reading, GB","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086247309","id":37086247309,"full_name":"Tim Hewson","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Reading, GB"]}},{"affiliation":"Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft und Raumfahrt, Berlin, Berlin, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086544129","id":37086544129,"full_name":"Andreas Schätler","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft und Raumfahrt, Berlin, Berlin, DE"]}},{"affiliation":"Technische Universitat Munchen, Munchen, Bayern, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37444424000","id":37444424000,"full_name":"Rüdiger Westermann","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technische Universitat Munchen, Munchen, Bayern, DE"]}},{"affiliation":"Technische Universitat Munchen, Munchen, Bayern, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085907360","id":37085907360,"full_name":"Marc Rautenhaus","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technische Universitat Munchen, Munchen, Bayern, DE"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Atmospheric fronts play a central role in meteorology, as the boundaries between different air masses and as fundamental features of extra-tropical cyclones.

In this work, we -a team of visualization scientists and meteorologists-propose a novel visualization approach to analyze the three-dimensional structure of atmospheric fronts and related physical and dynamical processes. We build upon existing approaches to objectively identify fronts as lines in two dimensions and extend these to obtain frontal surfaces in three dimensions, using the magnitude of temperature change along the gradient of a moist potential temperature field as the primary identifying factor. We introduce the use of normal curves in the temperature gradient field to visualize a frontal zone (i.e., the transitional zone between the air masses) and the distribution of atmospheric variables in such zones. To enable for the first time a statistical analysis of frontal zones, we present a new approach to obtain the volume enclosed by a zone, by classifying grid boxes that intersect with normal curves emanating from a selected front.

This is due to the fact that the invariant space is three-dimensional for symmetric second-order tensors over a spatial domain. We present an algorithm for surface construction for simplicial grids in the domain and simplicial surfaces in the invariant space. We demonstrate our approach by applying it to stress fields from component design in mechanical engineering.","article_number":"8447439","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8447439","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8447439/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8447439/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"1122","end_page":"1131","citing_paper_count":18,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":575,"insert_date":"20180826","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Tensile stress","Visualization","Mechanical engineering","Strain","Geometry","Neuroscience"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["visualization","tensor field","invariants","fiber surface","interaction"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Fiber Surface","Fibre Surface","Invariant Space","Interactive","Vector Field","Stress Field","Design Of Components","Interactive Visualization","Mechanical Engineering","Surface Space","Symmetric Tensor","Second-order Tensor","Triangular","Triangle","Maximum And Minimum","Stationary Point","Extreme Values","Extremal","Coordinate System","Shear Stress","Tetrahedral","Tetrahedron","Diffusion Tensor Imaging","Diffusion-weighted Imaging","Diffusion Weighted Imaging","Diffusion Tensor","Physical Domain","Stress Tensor","Orthonormal Basis","Orthogonal Set","Principal Stress","Yield Surface","Output Surface","Invariant Theory","Invariant Tensor","Three-dimensional Domain","Cylindrical System","Geometric Primitives","Graphical Primitives","Hydrostatic Stress","Strength Of Component","Von Mises","Cauchy Stress Tensor","Deviatoric Stress Tensor","Stress Vector"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865051","title":"Drag and Track: A Direct Manipulation Interface for Contextualizing Data Instances within a Continuous Parameter Space","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":76,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086544118","id":37086544118,"full_name":"Daniel Orban","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, US"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267356000","id":37267356000,"full_name":"Daniel F.

Our goals are two-fold: first, to build a user-directed intuition of dimensionally reduced data, and second, to provide a mechanism for creatively exploring parameter relationships in parameterized simulation sets, called ensembles. We start by visualizing ensemble data instances in dimensionally reduced scatter plots. To understand these abstract views, we employ user-defined virtual data instances that, through direct manipulation, search an ensemble for similar instances. Users can create multiple of these direct manipulation queries to visually annotate the spaces with sets of highlighted ensemble data instances. User-defined goals are therefore translated into custom illustrations that are projected onto the dimensionally reduced spaces. Combined forward and inverse searches of the parameter space follow naturally allowing for continuous parameter space prediction and visual query comparison in the context of an ensemble. The potential for this visualization technique is confirmed via expert user feedback for a shock physics application and synthetic model analysis.","article_number":"8440838","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440838","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440838/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440838/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"256","end_page":"266","citing_paper_count":18,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":711,"insert_date":"20180820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Electric shock","Physics","Navigation","Data models","Uncertainty"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual Parameter Space Analysis","Ensemble Visualization","Semantic Interaction","Direct Manipulation","Shock Physics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Parameter Space","Direct Use","Direct Utilization","Direct Manipulation","Data Instances","Instantaneous Data","Continuous Parameter Space","Scatter Plot","Materials Science","Visual Comparison","Visualization Techniques","Similar Instances","Ensemble Data","Sensitivity Analysis","Input Parameters","Visual Representation","Visual Analysis","Visual Search","Visual Scanning","Output Parameters","Yield Parameters","Input Space","Dimensionality Reduction Methods","Dimensionality Reduction Method","Estimation Step","Forward Approach","Output Space","Query Set","Inverse Approach","Inversion Approach","Input-output Model","Input-output Analysis","Query Point","Output Curves","IS Curve","Interaction Techniques","Los Alamos National Laboratory","Navigation Strategies","Search Step"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864816","title":"Interactive Visualization of 3D Histopathology in Native Resolution","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":77,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Linkopings universitet, Linkoping, SE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37565763500","id":37565763500,"full_name":"Martin Falk","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Linkopings universitet, Linkoping, SE"]}},{"affiliation":"Linkopings universitet, Linkoping, SE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284192000","id":37284192000,"full_name":"Anders Ynnerman","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Linkopings universitet, Linkoping, SE"]}},{"affiliation":"Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds, Leeds, GB","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085337805","id":37085337805,"full_name":"Darren Treanor","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds, Leeds, GB"]}},{"affiliation":"Linkopings universitet, Linkoping, SE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284209100","id":37284209100,"full_name":"Claes Lundström","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Linkopings universitet, Linkoping, SE"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present a visualization application that enables effective interactive visual analysis of large-scale 3D histopathology, that is, high-resolution 3D microscopy data of human tissue. Clinical work flows and research based on pathology have, until now, largely been dominated by 2D imaging. As we will show in the paper, studying volumetric histology data will open up novel and useful opportunities for both research and clinical practice. Our starting point is the current lack of appropriate visualization tools in histopathology, which has been a limiting factor in the uptake of digital pathology. Visualization of 3D histology data does pose difficult challenges in several aspects. The full-color datasets are dense and large in scale, on the order of $100,000\\times 100,000\\times 100$ voxels. This entails serious demands on both rendering performance and user experience design. Despite this, our developed application supports interactive study of 3D histology datasets at native resolution. Our application is based on tailoring and tuning of existing methods, system integration work, as well as a careful study of domain specific demands emanating from a close participatory design process with domain experts as team members. Results from a user evaluation employing the tool demonstrate a strong agreement among the 14 participating pathologists that 3D histopathology will be a valuable and enabling tool for their work.","article_number":"8440070","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440070","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440070/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440070/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"1008","end_page":"1017","citing_paper_count":18,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":943,"insert_date":"20180819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three-dimensional displays","Data visualization","Pathology","Rendering (computer graphics)","Image color analysis","Microscopy","Two dimensional displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Histology","Pathology","Volume Rendering","Expert Evaluation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive","Native Resolution","3D Histopathology","User Experience","2D Images","Clinical Work","Domain Experts","Digital Pathology","Whole Slide Images","Whole-slide Images","Volumetric Data","Usability Evaluation","Usability Ratings","User Experience Design","Clinical Use","Low Resolution","Digital Images","Visual System","Transfer Function","Linear Interpolation","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Density Data","Storage Density","Set Of Interactions","3D Visualization","Ray Casting","Ray Shooting","Volume Rendering","Volumetric Rendering","Volume-rendering","Slide Images","Main View","Barrett’s Esophagus","Barrett’s Oesophagus","Similar Color","Similar Colour","Global Scene","Camera Movement","Trilinear Interpolation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865141","title":"A Declarative Rendering Model for Multiclass Density Maps","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":78,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Seoul National University, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, KR","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085589835","id":37085589835,"full_name":"Jaemin Jo","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Seoul National University, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, KR"]}},{"affiliation":"LIMSICNRSUniv.

This categorical attribute is often rendered using shape or color, which does not scale when overplotting occurs. When the number of data points increases, multiclass maps must resort to data aggregation to remain readable. We present multiclass density maps: multiple 2D histograms computed for each of the category values. Multiclass density maps are meant as a building block to improve the expressiveness and scalability of multiclass map visualization. In this article, we first present a short survey of aggregated multiclass maps, mainly from cartography. We then introduce a declarative model—a simple yet expressive JSON grammar associated with visual semantics—that specifies a wide design space of visualizations for multiclass density maps. Our declarative model is expressive and can be efficiently implemented in visualization front-ends such as modern web browsers. Furthermore, it can be reconfigured dynamically to support data exploration tasks without recomputing the raw data. Finally, we demonstrate how our model can be used to reproduce examples from the past and support exploring data at scale.","article_number":"8440817","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440817","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440817/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440817/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"470","end_page":"480","citing_paper_count":18,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":994,"insert_date":"20180820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Image color analysis","Task analysis","Scalability","Visualization","Computational modeling","Rendering (computer graphics)"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Scalability","multiclass scatterplots","density maps","aggregation","declarative specification","visualization grammar"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Density Map","Scalable","Aggregate Data","Cartographic","Quantitative Properties","Quantitative Dimensions","Quantitative Attributes","2D Histogram","Modern Web Browser","Modern Browsers","Visual System","Weaving","Woven","Logarithmic Scale","Log-scale","Log Scale","Linear Scale","Scale Bar","Vector Data","Visualization Techniques","Visual Properties","Visual Attributes","Uniform Color","Uniform Colour","Interactive Exploration","Multiple Colors","Multiple Colours","Choropleth Maps","Color Mixing","Colour Mixing","Millions Of Points","Bivariate Data","Alpha Matte","Alpha Maps","Alpha Blending","Alpha Channel","Aggregate Counts","Arrival Delay","Non-integer Values","Assembly Operations","Number Of Data Points","Map Design","Cartographic Design","Bar Charts"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864886","title":"MAQUI: Interweaving Queries and Pattern Mining for Recursive Event Sequence Exploration","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":79,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085886497","id":37085886497,"full_name":"Po-Ming Law","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Adobe Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592993600","id":37592993600,"full_name":"Zhicheng Liu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Adobe Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Adobe Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086060990","id":37086060990,"full_name":"Sana Malik","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Adobe Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37829310200","id":37829310200,"full_name":"Rahul C.

Analysts often interweave querying and mining in a recursive manner during event sequence analysis: sequences extracted as query results are used for mining patterns, patterns generated are incorporated into a new query for segmenting the sequences, and the resulting segments are mined or queried again. To support flexible analysis, we propose a framework that describes the process of interwoven querying and mining. Based on this framework, we developed MAQUI, a Mining And Querying User Interface that enables recursive event sequence exploration.

Recent studies have indicated that changes and disruptions within such networks can serve as indicators for increased risks of violence and armed conflicts. This is especially true of countries that may not be able to compete for scarce commodities during supply shocks. Thus, network-induced vulnerability to supply disruption is typically exported from wealthier populations to disadvantaged populations. As such, researchers and stakeholders concerned with supply chains, political science, environmental studies, etc. need tools to explore the complex dynamics within global trade networks and how the structure of these networks relates to regional instability. However, the multivariate, spatiotemporal nature of the network structure creates a bottleneck in the extraction and analysis of correlations and anomalies for exploratory data analysis and hypothesis generation. Working closely with experts in political science and sustainability, we have developed a highly coordinated, multi-view framework that utilizes anomaly detection, network analytics, and spatiotemporal visualization methods for exploring the relationship between global trade networks and regional instability. Requirements for analysis and initial research questions to be investigated are elicited from domain experts, and a variety of visual encoding techniques for rapid assessment of analysis and correlations between trade goods, network patterns, and time series signatures are explored. We demonstrate the application of our framework through case studies focusing on armed conflicts in Africa, regional instability measures, and their relationship to international global trade.","article_number":"8440040","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440040","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440040/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440040/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"331","end_page":"341","citing_paper_count":17,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1458,"insert_date":"20180819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visual analytics","Correlation","Anomaly detection","Time series analysis","Spatiotemporal phenomena"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Global trade network","anomaly detection","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Network Analysis","Visual Analysis","Trade Network","Visual Framework","Trade Network Analysis","Visual Analytics Framework","Correlation Analysis","Time Series","Time-series","Exploratory Analysis","Exploratory Data Analysis","Supply Chain","International Trade","Global Trade","Trading Partners","Foreign Trade","Political Science","Political Studies","Visual Methods","Visual Method","Hypothesis Generation","Domain Experts","Anomaly Detection","Instability Region","Local Structure","Local Patterns","Main Map","Important Increase","Measure Of Stability","Important Decrease","Choropleth Maps","Trading Countries","Flow Map","Network Changes","Amount Of Trade","Trade Quantity","Line Chart"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864491","title":"Labels on Levels: Labeling of Multi-Scale Multi-Instance and Crowded 3D Biological Environments","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":81,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"TU Wien","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086238484","id":37086238484,"full_name":"David Kouřil","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Wien"]}},{"affiliation":"Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University, Prague","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543101","id":37086543101,"full_name":"Ladislav Čmolík","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University, Prague"]}},{"affiliation":"Masaryk University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085711031","id":37085711031,"full_name":"Barbora Kozlíková","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Masaryk University"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Wien","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38007838000","id":38007838000,"full_name":"Hsiang-Yun Wu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Wien"]}},{"affiliation":"Allen Institute for Cell Science","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38488448400","id":38488448400,"full_name":"Graham Johnson","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Allen Institute for Cell Science"]}},{"affiliation":"The Scripps Research Institute","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086211853","id":37086211853,"full_name":"David S.

We present a method for interactive labeling of crowded 3D scenes containing very many instances of objects spanning multiple scales in size. In contrast to previous labeling methods, we target cases where many instances of dozens of types are present and where the hierarchical structure of the objects in the scene presents an opportunity to choose the most suitable level for each placed label. Our solution builds on and goes beyond labeling techniques in medical 3D visualization, cartography, and biological illustrations from books and prints. In contrast to these techniques, the main characteristics of our new technique are: 1) a novel way of labeling objects as part of a bigger structure when appropriate, 2) visual clutter reduction by labeling only representative instances for each type of an object, and a strategy of selecting those. The appropriate level of label is chosen by analyzing the scene's depth buffer and the scene objects' hierarchy tree. We address the topic of communicating the parent-children relationship between labels by employing visual hierarchy concepts adapted from graphic design. Selecting representative instances considers several criteria tailored to the character of the data and is combined with a greedy optimization approach. We demonstrate the usage of our method with models from mesoscale biology where these two characteristics-multi-scale and multi-instance-are abundant, along with the fact that these scenes are extraordinarily dense.","article_number":"8440077","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440077","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440077/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440077/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"977","end_page":"986","citing_paper_count":17,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1744,"insert_date":"20180819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three-dimensional displays","Labeling","Proteins","Visualization","Blood","Biological system modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["labeling","multi-scale data","multi-instance data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Biological Environment","Interactive","Labeling Method","Labeling Methods","Objects In The Scene","Labeling Techniques","3D Scene","Instances Of Type","Object Instances","Object Labels","Level Of Labeling","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Visual Hierarchy","Blood Plasma","Free Space","Free-space","3D Space","3-dimensional Space","Surface Model","Structural Biology","Hoarding","Billboards","Scale Level","Object Distance","Label Positions","Temporal Coherence","Human Immunodeficiency Virus Virion","Label Size","Object Annotations","Output Of Step","Scene Graph","Pixel Position","Visual Communication","Current Frame"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865117","title":"Patterns and Pace: Quantifying Diverse Exploration Behavior with Visualizations on the Web","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":82,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Worcester Polytechnic Institute","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085354408","id":37085354408,"full_name":"Mi Feng","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Worcester Polytechnic Institute"]}},{"affiliation":"Bucknell University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085717352","id":37085717352,"full_name":"Evan Peck","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Bucknell University"]}},{"affiliation":"Worcester Polytechnic Institute","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546111900","id":37546111900,"full_name":"Lane Harrison","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Worcester Polytechnic Institute"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The diverse and vibrant ecosystem of interactive visualizations on the web presents an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to observe and analyze how everyday people interact with data visualizations. However, existing metrics of visualization interaction behavior used in research do not fully reveal the breadth of peoples' open-ended explorations with visualizations. One possible way to address this challenge is to determine high-level goals for visualization interaction metrics, and infer corresponding features from user interaction data that characterize different aspects of peoples' explorations of visualizations. In this paper, we identify needs for visualization behavior measurement, and develop corresponding candidate features that can be inferred from users' interaction data. We then propose metrics that capture novel aspects of peoples' open-ended explorations, including exploration uniqueness and exploration pacing. We evaluate these metrics along with four other metrics recently proposed in visualization literature by applying them to interaction data from prior visualization studies. The results of these evaluations suggest that these new metrics 1) reveal new characteristics of peoples' use of visualizations, 2) can be used to evaluate statistical differences between visualization designs, and 3) are statistically independent of prior metrics used in visualization research. We discuss implications of these results for future studies, including the potential for applying these metrics in visualization interaction analysis, as well as emerging challenges in developing and selecting metrics depicting visualization explorations.","article_number":"8454489","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8454489","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8454489/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8454489/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"501","end_page":"511","citing_paper_count":16,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":709,"insert_date":"20180904","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Extraterrestrial measurements","Companies","Visual analytics","Feature extraction"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Interaction","Visualization","Quantitative Evaluation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Exploratory Behavior","Exploratory Behaviour","Data Visualization","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Interaction Behavior","Vision Research","Interactive Visualization","Visual Design","Aspects Of People","Experimental Group","Experimental Analysis","New Perspective","Types Of Interactions","User Groups","Raw Counts","User Behavior","User Behaviour","User Characteristics","User Features","Exploration Process","Visual Elements","Visual Approach","Term Frequency-inverse Document Frequency","Inverse Document Frequency","TF-IDF","Duration Of Interaction","Continuous Wavelet Transform","Visual Exploration","Exploration Time","Clickstream","Basic Metrics","Moments Of Interaction","Interaction Of People","Statistical Approach"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864826","title":"ViBr: Visualizing Bipartite Relations at Scale with the Minimum Description Length Principle","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":83,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"New York University, New York, NY, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086544677","id":37086544677,"full_name":"Gromit Yeuk-Yin Chan","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University, New York, NY, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Bosch Research North America, Sunnyvale","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085776768","id":37085776768,"full_name":"Panpan Xu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Bosch Research North America, Sunnyvale"]}},{"affiliation":"Bosch Research North America, Sunnyvale","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086546701","id":37086546701,"full_name":"Zeng Dai","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Bosch Research North America, Sunnyvale"]}},{"affiliation":"Bosch Research North America, Sunnyvale","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086048784","id":37086048784,"full_name":"Liu Ren","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Bosch Research North America, Sunnyvale"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Bipartite graphs model the key relations in many large scale real-world data: customers purchasing items, legislators voting for bills, people's affiliation with different social groups, faults occurring in vehicles, etc. However, it is challenging to visualize large scale bipartite graphs with tens of thousands or even more nodes or edges. In this paper, we propose a novel visual summarization technique for bipartite graphs based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle. The method simultaneously groups the two different set of nodes and constructs aggregated bipartite relations with balanced granularity and precision. It addresses the key trade-off that often occurs for visualizing large scale and noisy data: acquiring a clear and uncluttered overview while maximizing the information content in it. We formulate the visual summarization task as a co-clustering problem and propose an efficient algorithm based on locality sensitive hashing (LSH) that can easily scale to large graphs under reasonable interactive time constraints that previous related methods cannot satisfy. The method leads to the opportunity of introducing a visual analytics framework with multiple levels-of-detail to facilitate interactive data exploration. In the framework, we also introduce a compact visual design inspired by adjacency list representation of graphs as the building block for a small multiples display to compare the bipartite relations for different subsets of data. We showcase the applicability and effectiveness of our approach by applying it on synthetic data with ground truth and performing case studies on real-world datasets from two application domains including roll-call vote record analysis and vehicle fault pattern analysis. Interviews with experts in the political science community and the automotive industry further highlight the benefits of our approach.","article_number":"8440048","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440048","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440048/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440048/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"321","end_page":"330","citing_paper_count":16,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":614,"insert_date":"20180819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Bipartite graph","Visualization","Clustering algorithms","Complexity theory","Data models","Noise measurement"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Bipartite Graph","Visual Summarization","Minimum Description Length","Information Theory"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Minimum Description Length","Length Principle","Minimum Description Length Principle","Related Data","Political Science","Political Studies","Efficient Algorithm","Subset Of Data","Visual Analysis","Real-world Data","Exploratory Data","Noisy Data","Applicability Domain","Application Domains","Real-world Datasets","Real-world Data Sets","Automotive Industry","Visualization Techniques","Interactive Exploration","Visual Design","Compact Design","Patterning Defects","Fault Pattern","Large Graphs","Graphical Summary","Cluster Nodes","Node Attributes","Nodal Properties","Interactive Visualization","Usage Scenarios","Flow Map","Overview Of Data","Original Graph","Hierarchical Data","Analysis Tasks"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865232","title":"Narvis: Authoring Narrative Slideshows for Introducing Data Visualization Designs","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":84,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, HK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543277","id":37086543277,"full_name":"Qianwen Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, HK"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, HK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086546441","id":37086546441,"full_name":"Zhen Li","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, HK"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, HK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085458481","id":37085458481,"full_name":"Siwei Fu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, HK"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, Beijing, CN","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37391623900","id":37391623900,"full_name":"Weiwei Cui","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, Beijing, CN"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, HK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, HK"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Visual designs can be complex in modern data visualization systems, which poses special challenges for explaining them to the non-experts.

Narvis targets two types of end users: teachers, experts in data visualization who produce tutorials for explaining a data visualization, and students, non-experts who try to understand visualization designs through tutorials. We present an analysis of requirements through close discussions with the two types of end users. The resulting considerations guide the design and implementation of Narvis. Additionally, to help teachers better organize their introduction slideshows, we specify a data visualization as a hierarchical combination of components, which are automatically detected and extracted by Narvis. The teachers craft an introduction slideshow through first organizing these components, and then explaining them sequentially. A series of templates are provided for adding annotations and animations to improve efficiency during the authoring process. We evaluate Narvis through a qualitative analysis of the authoring experience, and a preliminary evaluation of the generated slideshows.","article_number":"8444072","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8444072","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8444072/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8444072/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"779","end_page":"788","citing_paper_count":16,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1183,"insert_date":"20180822","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Tools","Visualization","Tutorials","Encoding","Videos","Interviews"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Education","Narrative Visualization","Authoring Tools"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Visualization","Visual Design","End-users","Types Of Users","Design Requirements","Filtering Effect","Scalable Vector Graphics","Textual Descriptions","Use Of Different Types","Different Types Of Users","Editing Efficiency","Visual Components","Professional Software","Data Journalism","Diary Data","Data-driven Journalism","Line Chart","Knowledge Of Problems","Curse Of Knowledge","Understanding Of Design","Visual Channels","Graphical Elements","Visual Encoding","Feedback Phase","Advanced Visualization","Scene Graph","Graphics Editor","Arrow Line","Clear Narrative","Visual Saliency","Morphing","Bar Charts","Undergraduate Students","High Salience"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864911","title":"Structure-aware Fisheye Views for Efficient Large Graph Exploration","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":85,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, CN","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085804605","id":37085804605,"full_name":"Yunhai Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, CN"]}},{"affiliation":"Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, CN","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086261704","id":37086261704,"full_name":"Yanyan Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, CN"]}},{"affiliation":"Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, CN","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086236116","id":37086236116,"full_name":"Haifeng Zhang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, CN"]}},{"affiliation":"Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, CN","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086249398","id":37086249398,"full_name":"Yinqi Sun","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, CN"]}},{"affiliation":"Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, HK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37336329800","id":37336329800,"full_name":"Chi-Wing Fu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, HK"]}},{"affiliation":"Universitat Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590945600","id":37590945600,"full_name":"Michael Sedlmair","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universitat Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, DE"]}},{"affiliation":"Peking University, Beijing, Beijing, CN","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37600013700","id":37600013700,"full_name":"Baoquan Chen","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Peking University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"]}},{"affiliation":"Universitat Konstanz, Konstanz, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266781000","id":37266781000,"full_name":"Oliver Deussen","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universitat Konstanz, Konstanz, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, DE"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Traditional fisheye views for exploring large graphs introduce substantial distortions that often lead to a decreased readability of paths and other interesting structures.

Furthermore, the framework enables us to optimize fisheye lenses towards specific tasks and design a family of new lenses: polyfocal, cluster, and path lenses. A GPU implementation lets us process large graphs with up to 15,000 nodes at interactive rates.

The paper explores the additional gains that could be achieved by combining both strategies. In particular, we present a common framework that allows us to study the trade-off in reducing precision and/or resolution in a principled manner. We represent data reduction schemes as progressive streams of bits and study how various bit orderings such as by resolution, by precision, etc., impact the resulting approximation error across a variety of data sets as well as analysis tasks. Furthermore, we compute streams that are optimized for different tasks to serve as lower bounds on the achievable error.

Available visualization tools are limited to electron, two-photon, and confocal microscopy datasets, and current volume rendering techniques do not yield effective results when used with wide-field data. We present a workflow for the visualization of neuronal structures in wide-field microscopy images of brain samples. We introduce a novel gradient-based distance transform that overcomes the out-of-focus blur caused by the inherent design of wide-field microscopes. This is followed by the extraction of the 3D structure of neurites using a multi-scale curvilinear filter and cell-bodies using a Hessian-based enhancement filter. The response from these filters is then applied as an opacity map to the raw data. Based on the visualization challenges faced by domain experts, our workflow provides multiple rendering modes to enable qualitative analysis of neuronal structures, which includes separation of cell-bodies from neurites and an intensity-based classification of the structures. Additionally, we evaluate our visualization results against both a standard image processing deconvolution technique and a confocal microscopy image of the same specimen. We show that our method is significantly faster and requires less computational resources, while producing high quality visualizations.

Furthermore, we present a generally applicable hybrid implicit isosurface ray-tracing method, which provides better rendering quality and performance than the built-in sampling-based approach in OSPRay. Finally, we integrate our octant method and hybrid isosurface geometry into OSPRay as a module, providing the ability to create high-quality interactive visualizations combining volume and isosurface representations of BS-AMR data.

Researchers have to analyze multiple physico-chemical properties of the protein at once and combine them to derive conclusions about the protein-ligand interplay. Typically, several charts are inspected, and 3D animations can be played side-by-side to obtain a deeper understanding of the data. With the advances in simulation techniques, larger and larger datasets are available, with up to hundreds of thousands of steps. Unfortunately, such large trajectories are very difficult to investigate with traditional approaches. Therefore, the need for special tools that facilitate inspection of these large trajectories becomes substantial. In this paper, we present a novel system for visual exploration of very large trajectories in an interactive and user-friendly way. Several visualization motifs are automatically derived from the data to give the user the information about interactions between protein and ligand. Our system offers specialized widgets to ease and accelerate data inspection and navigation to interesting parts of the simulation. The system is suitable also for simulations where multiple ligands are involved. We have tested the usefulness of our tool on a set of datasets obtained from protein engineers, and we describe the expert feedback.","article_number":"8456856","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8456856","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8456856/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8456856/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"987","end_page":"996","citing_paper_count":12,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":715,"insert_date":"20180906","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Trajectory","Proteins","Three-dimensional displays","Computational modeling","Visualization","Data models","Inspection"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Molecular visualization","simulation inspection","long trajectories"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Protein Engineering","Part Of The Simulation","Visual Exploration","Hierarchical Clustering","Hierarchical Cluster Analysis","Molecular Dynamics Simulations","Molecular Simulations","Visual System","Energy System","Clustering Algorithm","Exploratory Data","Domain Experts","Types Of Clusters","Molecular Dynamics Trajectories","Interactive Exploration","Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm","Ligand Position","3D Configuration","2D Views","List Of Interactions","Visual Encoding","Zoom Level","Traditional Packaging","Right Click","Left Click","First Quartile","Upper Quartile","Lower Quartile","Interaction Techniques","Ligand Interactions","3D Visualization","Protein Atoms","Exploratory Tool"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864505","title":"Probabilistic Asymptotic Decider for Topological Ambiguity Resolution in Level-Set Extraction for Uncertain 2D Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":92,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Scientific Computing & Imaging (SCI) Institute, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077916100","id":37077916100,"full_name":"Tushar Athawale","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Scientific Computing & Imaging (SCI) Institute, University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"Scientific Computing & Imaging (SCI) Institute, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37276931400","id":37276931400,"full_name":"Chris R.

The marching squares (MS) algorithm for isocontour reconstruction generates a linear topology that is consistent with hyperbolic curves of a piecewise bilinear interpolation. The saddle points of the bilinear interpolant cause topological ambiguity in isocontour extraction. The midpoint decider and the asymptotic decider are well-known mathematical techniques for resolving topological ambiguities. The latter technique investigates the data values at the cell saddle points for ambiguity resolution. The uncertainty in data, however, leads to uncertainty in underlying bilinear interpolation functions for the MS algorithm, and hence, their saddle points. In our work, we study the behavior of the asymptotic decider when data at grid vertices is uncertain. First, we derive closed-form distributions characterizing variations in the saddle point values for uncertain bilinear interpolants. The derivation assumes uniform and nonparametric noise models, and it exploits the concept of ratio distribution for analytic formulations. Next, the probabilistic asymptotic decider is devised for ambiguity resolution in uncertain data using distributions of the saddle point values derived in the first step. Finally, the confidence in probabilistic topological decisions is visualized using a colormapping technique. We demonstrate the higher accuracy and stability of the probabilistic asymptotic decider in uncertain data with regard to existing decision frameworks, such as deciders in the mean field and the probabilistic midpoint decider, through the isocontour visualization of synthetic and real datasets.","article_number":"8440034","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440034","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440034/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440034/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"1163","end_page":"1172","citing_paper_count":12,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":347,"insert_date":"20180819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Uncertainty","Probabilistic logic","Two dimensional displays","Mathematical model","Topology","Interpolation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Isocontour visualization","topological uncertainty","marching squares","asymptotic decider","bilinear interpolation","probabilistic computation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Uncertain Data","Ambiguity Resolution","Topological Ambiguity","Values Of Variables","Resolution Of Data","Firm Data","Mean-field","Molecular Field","Mean-field Approximation","Noise Model","Saddle Point","Saddle-point","Saddle-node","Analytical Form","Bilinear Interpolation","Decision Confidence","Confident Conclusions","Interpolation Function","Uniform Model","Decision Framework","Uniform Noise","Concept Of Distribution","Variance In The Data","Random Variables","Monte Carlo Simulation","Monte Carlo Method","Uncertainty Values","First Quadrant","Joint Density","Values Of Cells","Left Column","Cumulative Density Function","Variation In Density","Kernel Estimation","Epanechnikov","Kernel Approximation","2D Cell","Nonparametric Density Estimation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864813","title":"Recirculation Surfaces for Flow Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":93,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Otto von Guericke Universitat Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Sachsen-Anhalt, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086545043","id":37086545043,"full_name":"Thomas Wilde","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Otto von Guericke Universitat Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Sachsen-Anhalt, DE"]}},{"affiliation":"Otto von Guericke Universitat Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Sachsen-Anhalt, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266876100","id":37266876100,"full_name":"Christian Rössi","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Otto von Guericke Universitat Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Sachsen-Anhalt, DE"]}},{"affiliation":"Otto von Guericke Universitat Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Sachsen-Anhalt, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266875400","id":37266875400,"full_name":"Holger Theisel","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Otto von Guericke Universitat Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Sachsen-Anhalt, DE"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present a formal approach to the visual analysis of recirculation in flows by introducing recirculation surfaces for 3D unsteady flow fields.

Based on this we construct an algorithm for their extraction, which searches for intersections of a recirculation surface with lines defined in 3D. This reduces the problem to a repeated search for critical points in 3D vector fields. We provide a uniform sampling of the search space paired with a surface reconstruction and visualize results. This way, we present the first algorithm for a comprehensive feature extraction in the 5D flow map of a 3D flow.

Essentially, one can think of this as a time series of trees with a node correspondence per hierarchy level between consecutive time steps. Existing visualization approaches for such data include animated 2D treemaps, where the dynamically changing layout makes it difficult to observe the data in its entirety. We present a method to visualize this dynamic data in a static, nested, and space-filling visualization. This is based on two major contributions: First, the layout constitutes a graph drawing problem.

Many of these systems have been developed with rich interactions, offering users the opportunity to examine details and explore hypotheses that have not been directly encoded by a designer. Understanding is enhanced when users can replay and revisit the steps in the sensemaking process, and in collaborative settings, it is especially important to be able to review not only the current state but also what decisions were made along the way. Unfortunately, many web-based systems lack the ability to capture such reasoning, and the path to a result is transient, forgotten when a user moves to a new view. This paper explores the requirements to augment existing client-side web applications with support for capturing, reviewing, sharing, and reusing steps in the reasoning process. Furthermore, it considers situations where decisions are made with streaming data, and the insights gained from revisiting those choices when more data is available. It presents a proof of concept, the Shareable Interactive Manipulation Provenance framework (SIMProv.js), that addresses these requirements in a modern, client-side JavaScript library, and describes how it can be integrated with existing frameworks.","article_number":"8500765","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500765","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8500765/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8500765/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"131","end_page":"141","citing_paper_count":11,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1033,"insert_date":"20181019","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Collaboration","History","Tools","Browsers","Libraries","Servers","Visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Collaboration","provenance","streaming data","history","web"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Web-based Application","Visual Analysis","Web Application","Data Streams","Web Browser","Sense-making Process","Prototype","Changes In Conditions","Changes In Status","Changes In State","Root Node","Parent Node","Interactive Visualization","Past Conditions","Past States","Debugging","View Data","Efficient Storage","Starting State","Acceptable State","Interactive Exploration","Visual Design","Breadth-first Search","Breadth First Search","Breadth-first","Inverse Changes","Provenance Information","Interactive Web Application","Web Framework","Tree View","Shared View","Design History","Navigation","Serialized","Past Work"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864801","title":"CoDDA: A Flexible Copula-based Distribution Driven Analysis Framework for Large-Scale Multivariate Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":97,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085738698","id":37085738698,"full_name":"Subhashis Hazarika","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077202300","id":37077202300,"full_name":"Soumya Dutta","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279493500","id":37279493500,"full_name":"Han-Wei Shen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085677253","id":37085677253,"full_name":"Jen-Ping Chen","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, US"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"CoDDA (Copula-based Distribution Driven Analysis) is a flexible framework for large-scale multivariate datasets. A common strategy to deal with large-scale scientific simulation data is to partition the simulation domain and create statistical data summaries. Instead of storing the high-resolution raw data from the simulation, storing the compact statistical data summaries results in reduced storage overhead and alleviated I/O bottleneck. Such summaries, often represented in the form of statistical probability distributions, can serve various post-hoc analysis and visualization tasks. However, for multivariate simulation data using standard multivariate distributions for creating data summaries is not feasible. They are either storage inefficient or are computationally expensive to be estimated in simulation time (in situ) for large number of variables. In this work, using copula functions, we propose a flexible multivariate distribution-based data modeling and analysis framework that offers significant data reduction and can be used in an in situ environment. The framework also facilitates in storing the associated spatial information along with the multivariate distributions in an efficient representation. Using the proposed multivariate data summaries, we perform various multivariate post-hoc analyses like query-driven visualization and sampling-based visualization. We evaluate our proposed method on multiple real-world multivariate scientific datasets. To demonstrate the efficacy of our framework in an in situ environment, we apply it on a large-scale flow simulation.","article_number":"8440043","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440043","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440043/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440043/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"1214","end_page":"1224","citing_paper_count":11,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":658,"insert_date":"20180819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data models","Computational modeling","Data visualization","Analytical models","Task analysis","Histograms","Probability distribution"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["In situ processing","Distribution-based","Multivariate","Query-driven","Copula"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Large-scale Data","Large Scale Data","Multivariate Data","Multivariate Statistics","Data Framework","Multivariate Analysis","Multivariable Analysis","Multivariate Analysis Of Variance","Raw Data","Post Hoc Test","Post Hoc Analysis","Data Model","Simulated Data","Spatial Information","Simulation Time","Statistical Distribution","Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function","Empirical Distribution Function","Data Reduction","Large-scale Datasets","Large-scale Data Sets","Visual Task","Multivariate Distribution","Analysis Tasks","Form Of Distribution","Flexible Framework","Simulation Domain","Large-scale Simulations","Large Scale Simulations","Cumulative Density Function","Gaussian Mixture Model","Original Raw Data","Standard Normal Distribution","Standard Gaussian Distribution","Univariate Distribution","Compact Representation","Multivariate Relationships","Multivariable Relationships","Standard Model","Multivariate Function","Multivariable Function","Storage Size"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864508","title":"Gaia Sky: Navigating the Gaia Catalog","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":98,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Heidelberg University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085895386","id":37085895386,"full_name":"Antoni Sagristà","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Heidelberg University"]}},{"affiliation":"Heidelberg University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085890621","id":37085890621,"full_name":"Stefan Jordan","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Heidelberg University"]}},{"affiliation":"Max Planck Institute for Astronomy","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37557887000","id":37557887000,"full_name":"Thomas Müller","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Max Planck Institute for Astronomy"]}},{"affiliation":"Heidelberg University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282541900","id":37282541900,"full_name":"Filip Sadlo","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Heidelberg University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this paper, we present Gaia Sky, a free and open-source multiplatform 3D Universe system, developed since 2014 in the Data Processing and Analysis Consortium framework of ESA's Gaia mission.

The great complexity of these structures, in particular, those of RNA, demands interactive visualization to get deeper insights into the relationship between the 2D secondary structure motifs and their 3D tertiary structures. Over the last decades, a lot of research in molecular visualization has focused on the visual exploration of protein structures while nucleic acids have only been marginally addressed. In contrast to proteins, which are composed of amino acids, the ingredients of nucleic acids are nucleotides. They form structuring patterns that differ from those of proteins and, hence, also require different visualization and exploration techniques. In order to support interactive exploration of nucleic acids, the computation of secondary structure motifs as well as their visualization in 2D and 3D must be fast. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the performance of both the computation and visualization of nucleic acid structure. We present a ray casting-based visualization of RNA and DNA secondary and tertiary structures, which enables for the first time real-time visualization of even large molecular dynamics trajectories. Furthermore, we provide a detailed description of all important aspects to visualize nucleic acid secondary and tertiary structures. With this, we close an important gap in molecular visualization.","article_number":"8494830","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8494830","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8494830/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8494830/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"967","end_page":"976","citing_paper_count":11,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":936,"insert_date":"20181017","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","RNA","DNA","Hydrogen","Two dimensional displays","Three-dimensional displays","Junctions"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Ribonucleic acids","DNA","RNA","secondary & tertiary structures","interactive rendering","ray casting","brushing & linking"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Deoxyribonucleic Acid","Deoxyribonucleic","Interactive Visualization","Ribonucleic Acid Structures","Nucleic Acid","DNA And RNA","Secondary Structure","3D Structure","Molecular Dynamics Trajectories","Visualization Techniques","3D Visualization","Interactive Exploration","Molecular Trajectories","Molecular Visualization","2D Visualization","Hydrogen Bonds","Pairing","Molecular Structure","Hydrogenation","Hydrogen Atoms","Types Of Pairs","Donor Atoms","Wobble Position","Wobble Pair","Wobble Base Pair","Ray Casting","Ray Shooting","Hoogsteen Base Pairs","Hoogsteen Pairing","Hoogsteen Base-pairing","Sugar Ring","Base Ring","Watson-Crick Pairing","Ribonucleic Acid Molecules","Concave Shape","End Of Strand","Gradient Descent Approach"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865042","title":"Identification of Temporally Varying Areas of Interest in Long-Duration Eye-Tracking Data Sets","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":100,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Linköping University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086071126","id":37086071126,"full_name":"Prithiviraj K.

Typically studies focus on short tasks and use static expected areas of interest (AoI) in the display to explore subjects' behaviour, making the analyst's task quite straightforward. In long-duration studies, where the observations may last several hours over a complete work session, the AoIs may change over time in response to altering workload, emergencies or other variables making the analysis more difficult. This work puts forward a novel method to automatically identify spatial AoIs changing over time through a combination of clustering and cluster merging in the temporal domain. A visual analysis system based on the proposed methods is also presented.

Spaghetti plots are conventional tools for meteorologists to directly examine the uncertainty exhibited by ensembles, where they simultaneously visualize isocontours of all ensemble members. To avoid visual clutter in practical usages, one needs to select a small number of informative isovalues for visual analysis. Moreover, due to the complex topology and variation of ensemble isocontours, it is often a challenging task to interpret the spaghetti plot for even a single isovalue in large ensembles. In this paper, we propose an interactive framework for uncertainty visualization of weather forecast ensembles that significantly improves and expands the utility of spaghetti plots in ensemble analysis. Complementary to state-of-the-art methods, our approach provides a complete framework for visual exploration of ensemble isocontours, including isovalue selection, interactive isocontour variability exploration, and interactive sub-region selection and re-analysis. Our framework is built upon the high-density clustering paradigm, where the mode structure of the density function is represented as a hierarchy of nested subsets of the data. We generalize the high-density clustering for isocontours and propose a bandwidth selection method for estimating the density function of ensemble isocontours. We present novel visualizations based on high-density clustering results, called the mode plot and the simplified spaghetti plot. The proposed mode plot visually encodes the structure provided by the high-density clustering result and summarizes the distribution of ensemble isocontours. It also enables the selection of subsets of interesting isocontours, which are interactively highlighted in a linked spaghetti plot for providing spatial context. To provide an interpretable overview of the positional variability of isocontours, our system allows for selection of informative isovalues from the simplified spaghetti plot. Due to the spatial variability of ensemble isocontours, the system allows for interactive selection and focus on sub-regions for local uncertainty and clustering re-analysis. We examine a number of ensemble datasets to establish the utility of our approach and discuss its advantages over state-of-the-art visual analysis tools for ensemble data.","article_number":"8440052","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440052","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440052/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440052/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"1091","end_page":"1101","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1126,"insert_date":"20180819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Uncertainty","Visualization","Weather forecasting","Atmospheric modeling","Tools"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Spaghetti plots","ensemble visualization","uncertainty visualization","high-density clustering","ensemble forecasting"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Ensemble Forecasts","Visual Framework","Visual Analysis","Clustering Results","Ensemble Members","Numerical Weather Prediction","Weather Models","Interactive Exploration","Ensemble Data","Bandwidth Selection","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Visual Analytics Tool","Hierarchical Clustering","Hierarchical Cluster Analysis","Forecasting","Random Fields","Density Estimation","Grid Points","Point Cloud","Point Clouds","Binary Image","Density Levels","High Saturation","Topological Data Analysis","Weather Research And Forecasting","Confidence Bands","Visual Encoding","Mean Shift Algorithm","Main Trends","Number Of Ensemble Members","Branches Of The Dendrogram","Local Mode","Latitude Longitude Grid","Latitude-longitude Grid","Longitude-latitude Grid"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864768","title":"Robust and Fast Extraction of 3D Symmetric Tensor Field Topology","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":102,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086255270","id":37086255270,"full_name":"Lawrence Roy","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086255123","id":37086255123,"full_name":"Prashant Kumar","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085665492","id":37085665492,"full_name":"Yue Zhang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37398562200","id":37398562200,"full_name":"Eugene Zhang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, US"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"3D symmetric tensor fields appear in many science and engineering fields, and topology-driven analysis is important in many of these application domains, such as solid mechanics and fluid dynamics. Degenerate curves and neutral surfaces are important topological features in 3D symmetric tensor fields. Existing methods to extract degenerate curves and neutral surfaces often miss parts of the curves and surfaces, respectively. Moreover, these methods are computationally expensive due to the lack of knowledge of structures of degenerate curves and neutral surfaces. In this paper, we provide theoretical analysis on the geometric and topological structures of degenerate curves and neutral surfaces of 3D linear tensor fields. These structures lead to parameterizations for degenerate curves and neutral surfaces that can not only provide more robust extraction of these features but also incur less computational cost. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach by applying our degenerate curve and neutral surface detection techniques to solid mechanics simulation data sets.","article_number":"8453873","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8453873","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453873/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453873/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"1102","end_page":"1111","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":385,"insert_date":"20180902","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Tensile stress","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Three-dimensional displays","Feature extraction","Topology","Solids","Robustness"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Tensor field visualization","3D symmetric tensor fields","tensor field topology","traceless tensors","degenerate curve extraction","neutral surface extraction"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Symmetric Tensor","Fast Extraction","Symmetric Tensor Field","Solid Mechanics","Hardening Mechanism","Curing Mechanism","3D Field","Neutral Surface","Symmetric Field","3D Tensor","Triangular","Triangle","Left Side","System Of Equations","Unit Vector","Unit Normal Vector","Direction Vector","Counterclockwise","Anticlockwise","Dot Product","Corresponding Points","Corresponding Features","Stress Tensor","Unit Sphere","Unit Ball","Fluid Mechanics","Elliptic Curve","Elliptic Equation","Tangent Vector","Degenerate Points","Traceless","Dominant Eigenvalue","Local Linear","Tetrahedral Mesh","Exit Point","Inverse Mapping"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864828","title":"Objective Vortex Corelines of Finite-sized Objects in Fluid Flows","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":103,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics LaboratoryETH Zürich","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085416142","id":37085416142,"full_name":"Tobias Günther","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics LaboratoryETH Zürich"]}},{"affiliation":"Visual Computing Group, University of Magdeburg","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266875400","id":37266875400,"full_name":"Holger Theisel","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Computing Group, University of Magdeburg"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Vortices are one of the most-frequently studied phenomena in fluid flows. The center of the rotating motion is called the vortex coreline and its successful detection strongly depends on the choice of the reference frame. The optimal frame moves with the center of the vortex, which incidentally makes the observed fluid flow steady and thus standard vortex coreline extractors such as Sujudi-Haimes become applicable. Recently, an objective optimization framework was proposed that determines a near-steady reference frame for tracer particles. In this paper, we extend this technique to the detection of vortex corelines of inertial particles. An inertial particle is a finite-sized object that is carried by a fluid flow. In contrast to the usual tracer particles, they do not move tangentially with the flow, since they are subject to gravity and exhibit mass-dependent inertia. Their particle state is determined by their position and own velocity, which makes the search for the optimal frame a high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate in this paper that the objective detection of an inertial vortex coreline can be reduced in 2D to a critical point search in 2D. For 3D flows, however, the vortex coreline criterion remains a parallel vectors condition in 6D. To detect the vortex corelines we propose a recursive subdivision approach that is tailored to the underlying structure of the 6D vectors. The resulting algorithm is objective, and we demonstrate the vortex coreline extraction in a number of 2D and 3D vector fields.","article_number":"8440096","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440096","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440096/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440096/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"956","end_page":"966","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":430,"insert_date":"20180819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three-dimensional displays","Visualization","Two dimensional displays","Atmospheric measurements","Particle measurements","Tensile stress","Feature extraction"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Vortex extraction","inertial particles","objectivity","vortex coreline"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Fluid Flow","Liquid Flow","Fluid Velocity","Critical Point","Reference Frame","Vector Field","Tracer Particles","3D Flow","Vortex Center","2D Vector","Particle Inertia","Optimal Frame","Parallel Vector","Tetrahedral","Tetrahedron","Equations Of Motion","Constant Speed","Spatial Domain","Objective Methods","Objective Method","Line Segment","Future Approaches","Particle Velocity","Neighborhood Size","Neighbourhood Size","Local Reference Frame","Local Reference System","Local Inertial Frame","Time-dependent Flow","Time Dependent Flow","Vortex Core","Temporal Derivative","2D Flow","Skew-symmetric","Skew-symmetric Matrix","Massless Particles","2D Case","Inertial Motion","Speed Direction"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864847","title":"Culling for Extreme-Scale Segmentation Volumes: A Hybrid Deterministic and Probabilistic Approach","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":104,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37409575800","id":37409575800,"full_name":"Johanna Beyer","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086021283","id":37086021283,"full_name":"Haneen Mohammed","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, US"]}},{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, SA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37991435500","id":37991435500,"full_name":"Marco Agus","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, SA"]}},{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, SA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37071605900","id":37071605900,"full_name":"Ali K.

We focus on integer label data, whose efficient representation in memory, as well as fast random data access, pose an even greater challenge than the raw image data. Often, it is crucial to be able to rapidly identify which segments are located where, whether for empty space skipping for fast rendering, or for spatial proximity queries. We refer to this process as culling. In order to enable efficient culling of millions of labeled segments, we present a novel hybrid approach that combines deterministic and probabilistic representations of label data in a data-adaptive hierarchical data structure that we call the label list tree. In each node, we adaptively encode label data using either a probabilistic constant-time access representation for fast conservative culling, or a deterministic logarithmic-time access representation for exact queries. We choose the best data structures for representing the labels of each spatial region while building the label list tree. At run time, we further employ a novel query-adaptive culling strategy. While filtering a query down the tree, we prune it successively, and in each node adaptively select the representation that is best suited for evaluating the pruned query, depending on its size. We show an analysis of the efficiency of our approach with several large data sets from connectomics, including a brain scan with more than 13 million labeled segments, and compare our method to conventional culling approaches. Our approach achieves significant reductions in storage size as well as faster query times.","article_number":"8444102","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8444102","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8444102/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8444102/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"1132","end_page":"1141","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":389,"insert_date":"20180822","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Data structures","Image segmentation","Probabilistic logic","Data visualization","Encoding","Mice"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Hierarchical Culling","Segmented Volume Data","Bloom Filter","Volume Rendering","Spatial Queries"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Segmented Volume","Raw Data","Large Datasets","Large Data Sets","Data Structure","Imaging Data","Running Time","Volume Of Data","Intensity Data","Labeled Data","Random Access","Spatial Regions","Fast Access","Raw Image Data","Probabilistic Representation","Storage Size","Raw Volume","Spatial Query","False Positive Rate","False-positive Rate","Root Node","Parent Node","Tree Nodes","Level Of Resolution","Bloom Filter","Volume Rendering","Volumetric Rendering","Volume-rendering","Number Of Labels","List Of Nodes","Leaf Node","Roaring","Cardinality Of The Set","Data Nodes","Hierarchical Algorithm","Node Level","Lymph Node Levels"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864690","title":"Interactive obstruction-free lensing for volumetric data visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":105,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"ENACFrench Civil Aviation University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086037802","id":37086037802,"full_name":"Michael Traoré","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["ENACFrench Civil Aviation University"]}},{"affiliation":"ENAC, French Civil Aviation University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017336200","id":38017336200,"full_name":"Christophe Hurter","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["ENAC, French Civil Aviation University"]}},{"affiliation":"Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, Groningen, Groningen, NL","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268047100","id":37268047100,"full_name":"Alexandru Telea","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, Groningen, Groningen, NL"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Occlusion is an issue in volumetric visualization as it prevents direct visualization of the region of interest. While many techniques such as transfer functions, volume segmentation or view distortion have been developed to address this, there is still room for improvement to better support the understanding of objects' vicinity. However, most existing Focus+Context fail to solve partial occlusion in datasets where the target and the occluder are very similar density-wise. For these reasons, we investigate a new technique which maintains the general structure of the investigated volumetric dataset while addressing occlusion issues. With our technique, the user interactively defines an area of interest where an occluded region or object is partially visible. Then our lens starts pushing at its border occluding objects, thus revealing hidden volumetric data. Next, the lens is modified with an extended field of view (fish-eye deformation) to better see the vicinity of the selected region. Finally, the user can freely explore the surroundings of the area under investigation within the lens. To provide real-time exploration, we implemented our lens using a GPU accelerated ray-casting framework to handle ray deformations, local lighting, and local viewpoint manipulation. We illustrate our technique with five application scenarios in baggage inspection, 3D fluid flow visualization, chest radiology, air traffic planning, and DTI fiber exploration.","article_number":"8467383","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8467383","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8467383/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8467383/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"1029","end_page":"1039","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":811,"insert_date":"20180918","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Lenses","Strain","Data visualization","Transfer functions","Three-dimensional displays","Animation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Interaction techniques","focus + context","volume visualization","volume rendering","raycasting"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive","Volumetric Data","Field Of View","Field-of-view","Transfer Function","Diffusion Tensor Imaging","Diffusion-weighted Imaging","Diffusion Weighted Imaging","Diffusion Tensor","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","3D Flow","Local Light","Occluded Objects","Years Of Experience","Streamline","Automatic System","Corpus Callosum","Callose","Global Context","Optical Axis","Fiber Axis","Beam Axis","Unfocused","Out Of Focus","Out-of-focus","Structures Of Interest","Fiber Tracts","Fiber Pathways","Fibre Tracts","Depth Of Focus","Depth-of-focus","Focal Depths","Focal Depth","Air Control","Air Traffic Control","Target View","Target Part","Principal Plane","Center Of The Lens","Optical Center","Airport Security","Classical 2D","Polyline","2D Techniques","Arrow Keys","Light Vector","Focal Point"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864509","title":"Visual Analysis of Aneurysm Data using Statistical Graphics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":106,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Otto von Guericke Universitat Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Sachsen-Anhalt, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085898826","id":37085898826,"full_name":"Monique Meuschke","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Otto von Guericke Universitat Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Sachsen-Anhalt, DE"]}},{"affiliation":"Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule Zurich, Zurich, ZH, CH","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085416142","id":37085416142,"full_name":"Tobias Günther","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule Zurich, Zurich, ZH, CH"]}},{"affiliation":"Otto von Guericke Universitat Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Sachsen-Anhalt, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085478990","id":37085478990,"full_name":"Philipp Berg","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Otto von Guericke Universitat Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Sachsen-Anhalt, DE"]}},{"affiliation":"Heart of Jesus Hospital, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085480556","id":37085480556,"full_name":"Ralph Wickenhöfer","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Heart of Jesus Hospital, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Otto von Guericke Universitat Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Sachsen-Anhalt, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37424645300","id":37424645300,"full_name":"Bernhard Preim","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Otto von Guericke Universitat Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Sachsen-Anhalt, DE"]}},{"affiliation":"Universitat Koblenz-Landau, Koblenz, Rheinland-Pfalz, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085527253","id":37085527253,"full_name":"Kai Lawonn","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universitat Koblenz-Landau, Koblenz, Rheinland-Pfalz, DE"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"This paper presents a framework to explore multi-field data of aneurysms occurring at intracranial and cardiac arteries by using statistical graphics. The rupture of an aneurysm is often a fatal scenario, whereas during treatment serious complications for the patient can occur. Whether an aneurysm ruptures or whether a treatment is successful depends on the interaction of different morphological such as wall deformation and thickness, and hemodynamic attributes like wall shear stress and pressure. Therefore, medical researchers are very interested in better understanding these relationships. However, the required analysis is a time-consuming process, where suspicious wall regions are difficult to detect due to the time-dependent behavior of the data. Our proposed visualization framework enables medical researchers to efficiently assess aneurysm risk and treatment options. This comprises a powerful set of views including 2D and 3D depictions of the aneurysm morphology as well as statistical plots of different scalar fields. Brushing and linking aids the user to identify interesting wall regions and to understand the influence of different attributes on the aneurysm's state. Moreover, a visual comparison of pre- and post-treatment as well as different treatment options is provided.

To study the dependency among attributes, which need not be linear, we extend and compute the mutual information (MI) among attributes over time. To help visualize and interpret the derived correlation and dependency among attributes associated with a particle, we encode the correlation and dependency values on individual pathlines. Finally, to utilize the correlation and MI computation results to identify regions with interesting flow behavior, we propose a segmentation strategy of the flow domain based on the ranking of the strength of the attributes relations.

We demonstrate the power and flexibility of our approach using multiple practical volume visualizations.","article_number":"8440063","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440063","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440063/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440063/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"1050","end_page":"1059","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":722,"insert_date":"20180819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Rendering (computer graphics)","Pipelines","Grammar","Visualization","DSL","Image color analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Volume visualization","direct volume rendering","declarative specification","multivariate/multimodal volume data","animation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Transfer Function","Volume Rendering","Volumetric Rendering","Volume-rendering","Data Visualization","Graphics Processing Unit","GPUs","Graphical User Interface","Graphical Interface","Application Programming Interface","Programming Interface","Analysis Tasks","Color Map","Colour Map","Colormap","Visualization Purposes","Scalar Value","Control Panel","Source Field","Pipeline Model","Composition Operator","Domain-specific Languages","Way For Users","Ray Casting","Ray Shooting","Alpha Matte","Alpha Maps","Alpha Blending","Alpha Channel","Vortex Lines","Vortex Tubes","JavaScript Object Notation","Computed Tomography Volumes","Scientific Visualization","Visual Task","Programming Experience","Multidimensional Function","Multidimensional Map","Current Design","Current Name","Visual System","Illumination","Lighting"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864827","title":"Hexahedral Mesh Structure Visualization and Evaluation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":110,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Houston, Houston, TX, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086544914","id":37086544914,"full_name":"Kaoji Xu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Houston, Houston, TX, US"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Houston, Houston, TX, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37069800000","id":37069800000,"full_name":"Guoning Chen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Houston, Houston, TX, US"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Understanding hexahedral (hex-) mesh structures is important for a number of hex-mesh generation and optimization tasks. However, due to various configurations of the singularities in a valid pure hex-mesh, the structure (or base complex) of the mesh can be arbitrarily complex. In this work, we present a first and effective method to help meshing practitioners understand the possible configurations in a valid 3D base complex for the characterization of their complexity. In particular, we propose a strategy to decompose the complex hex-mesh structure into multi-level sub-structures so that they can be studied separately, from which we identify a small set of the sub-structures that can most efficiently represent the whole mesh structure. Furthermore, from this set of sub-structures, we attempt to define the first metric for the quantification of the complexity of hex-mesh structure. To aid the exploration of the extracted multi-level structure information, we devise a visual exploration system coupled with a matrix view to help alleviate the common challenge of 3D data exploration (e.g., clutter and occlusion). We have applied our tool and metric to a large number of hex-meshes generated with different approaches to reveal different characteristics of these methods in terms of the mesh structures they can produce. We also use our metric to assess the existing structure simplification techniques in terms of their effectiveness.","article_number":"8440081","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440081","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440081/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440081/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"1173","end_page":"1182","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":502,"insert_date":"20180819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Complexity theory","Three-dimensional displays","Visualization","Periodic structures","Optimization","Splines (mathematics)","Mesh generation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["hexahedral mesh","base complex","sheet decomposition","complexity analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Mesh Structure","Interlocked Structure","Hexahedral Mesh","Complex Structure","Visual Exploration","Structural Optimization","Finite Element Analysis","Finite-element Analysis","First Search","Space Complexity","Memory Complexity","Minimum Overlap","Mesh Generation","Grid Generation","Diagonal Entries","Entire Complex","Smoothing Spline","Spline Fit","Smooth Spline","Multiple Edges","Multi-edge","Parallel Edges","Simple Configuration","Number Of Intersections","Depth-first","Depth First Search","Depth-first Search","Single Sheet","Breadth-first Search","Breadth First Search","Breadth-first","Individual Sheets","Current Sheet","Set Cover Problem","Subset Of Candidates","Irregular Edges","Optimal Subset","3D Structure","Orientation Model"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864498","title":"Deadeye: A Novel Preattentive Visualization Technique Based on Dichoptic Presentation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":111,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Center of Visual Data Analysis and Computer Graphics (COVIDAG), University of Duisburg-Essen","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547173","id":37086547173,"full_name":"Andrey Krekhov","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Center of Visual Data Analysis and Computer Graphics (COVIDAG), University of Duisburg-Essen"]}},{"affiliation":"Center of Visual Data Analysis and Computer Graphics (COVIDAG)University of Duisburg-Essen","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37548560500","id":37548560500,"full_name":"Jens Krüger","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Center of Visual Data Analysis and Computer Graphics (COVIDAG)University of Duisburg-Essen"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Preattentive visual features such as hue or flickering can effectively draw attention to an object of interest – for instance, an important feature in a scientific visualization.

In cases where binocular vision is applied, it is almost exclusively used to convey depth by exposing stereo pairs. We present Deadeye, a novel preattentive visualization technique based on presenting different stimuli to each eye. The target object is rendered for one eye only and is instantly detected by our visual system. In contrast to existing cues, Deadeye does not modify any visual properties of the target and, thus, is particularly suited for visualization applications. Our evaluation confirms that Deadeye is indeed perceived preattentively. We also explore a conjunction search based on our technique and show that, in contrast to 3D depth, the task cannot be processed in parallel.","article_number":"8440097","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440097","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440097/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440097/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"936","end_page":"945","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1157,"insert_date":"20180819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Visual systems","Image color analysis","Three-dimensional displays","Feature extraction","Shape","Color"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Popout","preattentive vision","comparative visualization","dichoptic presentation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Dichoptic Presentation","Visual System","Visual Features","Visual Characteristics","Object Of Interest","Target Object","3D Depth","Scientific Visualization","Reaction Time","Cardinality","Set Size","Focal Point","Visual Cues","Left Eye","Left Eyes","Monocular","Physical Demands","Primary Visual Cortex","Primary Visual Cortices","3D Visualization","Similar Strains","Stereopsis","Stereovision","Stereo Vision","Stereoscopic Vision","Depth Perception","Depth Cues","Binocular Rivalry","Mental Demands","Dominant Eye","Ocular Dominance","Binocular Disparity","Fixation Disparity","Saccadic Movements","Saccadic Eye Movements","Related Work Section","Error Rate","Line Chart","Blue Background"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865025","title":"An Information-Theoretic Approach to the Cost-benefit Analysis of Visualization in Virtual Environments","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":112,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Oxford, Oxford, Oxfordshire, GB","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37280982800","id":37280982800,"full_name":"Min Chen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Oxford, Oxford, Oxfordshire, GB"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282571800","id":37282571800,"full_name":"Kelly Gaither","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, US"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Chester, Chester, Cheshire West and Chester, GB","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300405500","id":37300405500,"full_name":"Nigel W.

Because of the development and operation costs of VEs, the majority of visualization applications in practice have yet to benefit from the capacity of VEs. In this paper, we examine this status quo from an information-theoretic perspective. Our objectives are to conduct cost-benefit analysis on typical VE systems (including augmented and mixed reality, theater-based systems, and large powerwalls), to explain why some visualization applications benefit more from VEs than others, and to sketch out pathways for the future development of visualization applications in VEs.

The most common solution, hover queries (i.e., tooltips), are fast and expressive but are usually limited to single mark (e.g., a bar in a bar chart). `Queries' to retrieve details for more complex sets of objects (e.g., comparisons between pairs of elements, averages across multiple items, trend lines, etc.) are difficult for end-users to invoke explicitly. Further, the output of these queries require complex annotations and overlays which need to be displayed and dismissed on demand to avoid clutter. In this work we introduce SmartCues, a library to support details-on-demand through dynamically computed overlays. For end-users, SmartCues provides multitouch interactions to construct complex queries for a variety of details. For designers, SmartCues offers an interaction library that can be used out-of-the-box, and can be extended for new charts and detail types. We demonstrate how SmartCues can be implemented across a wide array of visualization types and, through a lab study, show that end users can effectively use SmartCues.","article_number":"8440833","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440833","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440833/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440833/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"597","end_page":"607","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":567,"insert_date":"20180820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Bars","US Department of Defense","Task analysis","Visualization","Data visualization","Libraries","Color"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Graphical overlays","details-on-demand","graph comprehension"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Bar Charts","Ambiguity","Scatter Plot","Dependent And Independent Variables","Set Of Interactions","Alternative View","Line Graph","Reading Level","Query Language","Line Chart","Key Details","Use Of Gestures","Text Annotation","Visual Encoding","X-axis Values","Chart Types"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865118","title":"Shape-preserving Star Coordinates","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":114,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Westfalische Wilhelms-Universitat Munster, Munster, Nordrhein-Westfalen, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085799395","id":37085799395,"full_name":"Vladimir Molchanov","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Westfalische Wilhelms-Universitat Munster, Munster, Nordrhein-Westfalen, DE"]}},{"affiliation":"Westfalische Wilhelms-Universitat Munster, Munster, Nordrhein-Westfalen, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266826500","id":37266826500,"full_name":"Lars Linsen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Westfalische Wilhelms-Universitat Munster, Munster, Nordrhein-Westfalen, DE"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Dimensionality reduction is commonly applied to multidimensional data to reduce the complexity of their analysis. In visual analysis systems, projections embed multidimensional data into 2D or 3D spaces for graphical representation. To facilitate a robust and accurate analysis, essential characteristics of the multidimensional data shall be preserved when projecting. Orthographic star coordinates is a state-of-the-art linear projection method that avoids distortion of multidimensional clusters by restricting interactive exploration to orthographic projections. However, existing numerical methods for computing orthographic star coordinates have a number of limitations when putting them into practice. We overcome these limitations by proposing the novel concept of shape-preserving star coordinates where shape preservation is assured using a superset of orthographic projections. Our scheme is explicit, exact, simple, fast, parameter-free, and stable. To maintain a valid shape-preserving star-coordinates configuration during user interaction with one of the star-coordinates axes, we derive an algorithm that only requires us to modify the configuration of one additional compensatory axis. Different design goals can be targeted by using different strategies for selecting the compensatory axis. We propose and discuss four strategies including a strategy that approximates orthographic star coordinates very well and a data-driven strategy. We further present shape-preserving morphing strategies between two shape-preserving configurations, which can be adapted for the generation of data tours. We apply our concept to multiple data analysis scenarios to document its applicability and validate its desired properties.","article_number":"8440845","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440845","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440845/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440845/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"449","end_page":"458","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":573,"insert_date":"20180820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Shape","Two dimensional displays","Visualization","Data analysis","Principal component analysis","Distortion","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Star coordinates","multidimensional data projection","multivariate data visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Dimensionality Reduction","Numerical Methods","Numerical Method","Numerous Methods","3D Space","3-dimensional Space","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Multidimensional Data","Multidimensional Analysis","Projection Method","Projection Methods","Design Goals","Linear Projection","Data-driven Strategy","Straight Line","Length Scale","Target Location","Target Position","Interactive System","Dual System","Design Choices","Analysis Tasks","Properties Of Data","Data Attributes","Projection Matrix","Matrix Operations","Projection Matrices","Current Project","Low-dimensional Space","Lower-dimensional Space","Single Axis","Isotropic Scaling","Unit Circle","Hyperbola","Attribute Values","Numerical Instability","Numerically Unstable","Numerous Instances","Compensatory Movements","Visual Analysis Of Data"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864887","title":"InkPlanner: Supporting Prewriting via Intelligent Visual Diagramming","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":115,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, CA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547583","id":37086547583,"full_name":"Zhicong Lu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, CA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, CA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089577339","id":37089577339,"full_name":"Mingming Fan","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, CA"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, HK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086545328","id":37086545328,"full_name":"Yun Wang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, HK"]}},{"affiliation":"FX Palo Alto Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38024987300","id":38024987300,"full_name":"Jian Zhao","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["FX Palo Alto Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"MishMashMakers","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37393694700","id":37393694700,"full_name":"Michelle Annett","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["MishMashMakers"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, CA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37870405500","id":37870405500,"full_name":"Daniel Wigdor","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, CA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Prewriting is the process of generating and organizing ideas before drafting a document.

Based on the learners' needs and experts' recommendations, we then designed and developed InkPlanner, a novel pen and touch visualization tool that allows writers to utilize visual diagramming for ideation during prewriting. InkPlanner further allows writers to sort their ideas into a logical and sequential narrative by using a novel widget-NarrativeLine. Using a NarrativeLine, InkPlanner can automatically generate a document outline to guide later drafting exercises. Inkplanner is powered by machine-generated semantic and structural suggestions that are curated from various texts. To qualitatively review the tool and understand how writers use InkPlanner for prewriting, two writing experts were interviewed and a user study was conducted with university students.

It is the process through which relevant information is gathered, simplified, and expressed in summary form. Many popular visualization tools support automatic grouping of data (e.g., dividing up a numerical variable into bins). Although grouping plays a pivotal role in supporting data exploration, further adjustment and customization of auto-generated grouping criteria is non-trivial. Such adjustments are currently performed either programmatically or through menus and dialogues which require specific parameter adjustments over several steps. In response, we introduce Embedded Merge & Split (EMS), a new interaction technique for direct adjustment of data grouping criteria. We demonstrate how the EMS technique can be designed to directly manipulate width and position in bar charts and histograms, as a means for adjustment of data grouping criteria. We also offer a set of design guidelines for supporting EMS. Finally, we present the results of two user studies, providing initial evidence that EMS can significantly reduce interaction time compared to WIMP-based technique and was subjectively preferred by participants.","article_number":"8440855","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440855","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440855/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440855/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"800","end_page":"809","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":539,"insert_date":"20180820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Tools","Visualization","Bars","Histograms","Data analysis","Synthetic aperture sonar"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data Visualization","Direct Manipulation","Embedded Merge & Split","Data Grouping","Embedded Interaction"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Group Data","Data Visualization","Numerical Variables","Numerous Variables","Direct Use","Direct Utilization","Direct Manipulation","Visualization Tool","Bar Charts","Design Guidelines","Set Of Guidelines","Interaction Techniques","Summary Form","Histogram Bars","Exploratory Analysis","Exploratory Data Analysis","Values In Group","Number Of Steps","Specific Variables","Visual Representation","Types Of Tasks","Object Of Interest","Mental Models","Pie Chart","Bar Width","Bar Widths","HIV Research","Range Bin","Group Concept","Usage Intention","Bar Height","Height Of Each Bar","Fluid Interaction","Interaction Of Fluids","Control Panel","Treemap","Tree Map","Functional Tree","Performance Of Trees","Parallel Set","Set Of Analogs","Analogous Set"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864506","title":"Visualization of Bubble Formation in Porous Media","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":117,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, HK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37559772500","id":37559772500,"full_name":"Hui Zhang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, HK"]}},{"affiliation":"Universitat Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37553894500","id":37553894500,"full_name":"Steffen Frey","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universitat Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, DE"]}},{"affiliation":"Universitat Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086545289","id":37086545289,"full_name":"Holger Steeb","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universitat Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, DE"]}},{"affiliation":"Universitat Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086546057","id":37086546057,"full_name":"David Uribe","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universitat Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, DE"]}},{"affiliation":"Universitat Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268023800","id":37268023800,"full_name":"Thomas Ertl","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universitat Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, DE"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, HK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37280469500","id":37280469500,"full_name":"Wenping Wang","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, HK"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present a visualization approach for the analysis of CO2 bubble-induced attenuation in porous rock formations. As a basis for this, we introduce customized techniques to extract CO2 bubbles and their surrounding porous structure from X-ray computed tomography data (XCT) measurements. To understand how the structure of porous media influences the occurrence and the shape of formed bubbles, we automatically classify and relate them in terms of morphology and geometric features, and further directly support searching for promising porous structures. To allow for the meaningful direct visual comparison of bubbles and their structures, we propose a customized registration technique considering the bubble shape as well as its points of contact with the porous media surface. With our quantitative extraction of geometric bubble features, we further support the analysis as well as the creation of a physical model. We demonstrate that our approach was successfully used to answer several research questions in the domain, and discuss its high practical relevance to identify critical seismic characteristics of fluid-saturated rock that govern its capability to store CO2.","article_number":"8445644","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8445644","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8445644/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8445644/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"1060","end_page":"1069","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":953,"insert_date":"20180824","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Media","Shape","Visualization","Morphology","Feature extraction","Data mining"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["3D volume rendering","bubble visualization","porous media"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Porous Media","Porous Materials","Porous Matrix","Bubble Formation","Formation In Porous Media","Attenuation","Fading","Porous Structure","Pore Structure","Seismic","Earthquake","Geometric Features","Geometric Characteristics","CO2 Storage","Domain In Question","Questions In Each Domain","CO2 Bubbles","Bubble Shape","Local Structure","Resonance Frequency","Similar Shape","Similar Figure","Similar Geometry","Visual Analysis","Air Bubbles","Gas Bubbles","Phase Velocity","Phase Speed","Propagation Velocity","Propagation Speed","Carbon Fiber","Carbon Fibre","Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer","Carbon Sequestration","Carbon Burial","CO2 Sequestration","Plane Fitting","Iterative Closest Point","Central Voxel","Center Of Each Voxel","Gaussian Curvature","Bubble Size","Single Bubble","Formation Of Gas Bubbles","Iterative Closest Point Algorithm","Resonance Effect","Bubble Surface"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865266","title":"Image-Based Aspect Ratio Selection","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":118,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, CN","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085804605","id":37085804605,"full_name":"Yunhai Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, CN"]}},{"affiliation":"Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, CN","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086496886","id":37086496886,"full_name":"Zeyu Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, CN"]}},{"affiliation":"Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, Guangdong, CN","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37336329800","id":37336329800,"full_name":"Chi-Wing Fu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, Guangdong, CN"]}},{"affiliation":"Universitat Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085491052","id":37085491052,"full_name":"Hansjörq Schmauder","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universitat Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, DE"]}},{"affiliation":"Universitat Konstanz, Konstanz, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266781000","id":37266781000,"full_name":"Oliver Deussen","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universitat Konstanz, Konstanz, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, DE"]}},{"affiliation":"Universitat Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268045000","id":37268045000,"full_name":"Daniel Weiskopf","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universitat Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, DE"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Selecting a good aspect ratio is crucial for effective 2D diagrams. There are several aspect ratio selection methods for function plots and line charts, but only few can handle general, discrete diagrams such as 2D scatter plots. However, these methods either lack a perceptual foundation or heavily rely on intermediate isoline representations, which depend on choosing the right isovalues and are time-consuming to compute. This paper introduces a general image-based approach for selecting aspect ratios for a wide variety of 2D diagrams, ranging from scatter plots and density function plots to line charts. Our approach is derived from Federer's co-area formula and a line integral representation that enable us to directly construct image-based versions of existing selection methods using density fields. In contrast to previous methods, our approach bypasses isoline computation, so it is faster to compute, while following the perceptual foundation to select aspect ratios. Furthermore, this approach is complemented by an anisotropic kernel density estimation to construct density fields, allowing us to more faithfully characterize data patterns, such as the subgroups in scatterplots or dense regions in time series. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by quantitatively comparing to previous methods and revisiting a prior user study. Finally, we present extensions for ROI banking, multi-scale banking, and the application to image data.","article_number":"8440843","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440843","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440843/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440843/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"840","end_page":"849","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":576,"insert_date":"20180820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Two dimensional displays","Banking","Data visualization","Kernel","Market research","Estimation","Visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Aspect ratio","image-based method","Federer's co-area formula","density field","anisotropic kernel density estimation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Aspect Ratio","Isothermal","Contour Plots","Scatter Plot","Patterns In Data","User Study","Density Field","Line Chart","Line Integral","Image-based Approach","Imaging-based Approach","2D Diagrams","Gaussian Kernel","Gaussian Function","Kernel Function","Plot Data","Interesting Patterns","Pattern Of Involvement","Range Of Densities","Line Segment","Term In Eq","Similar Ratio","Arc Length","Curve Length","User Preferences","Image-based Methods","Imaging-based Methods","Image-based Method","Average Orientation","Delaunay Triangulation","2D Visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864656","title":"Firefly: Virtual Illumination Drones for Interactive Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":119,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Universitetet i Bergen, Bergen, Hordaland, NO","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085901852","id":37085901852,"full_name":"Sergej Stoppel","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universitetet i Bergen, Bergen, Hordaland, NO"]}},{"affiliation":"Universitetet i Bergen, Bergen, Hordaland, NO","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543909","id":37086543909,"full_name":"Magnus Paulson Erga","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universitetet i Bergen, Bergen, Hordaland, NO"]}},{"affiliation":"Universitetet i Bergen, Bergen, Hordaland, NO","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37265895700","id":37265895700,"full_name":"Stefan Bruckner","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universitetet i Bergen, Bergen, Hordaland, NO"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Light specification in three dimensional scenes is a complex problem and several approaches have been presented that aim to automate this process. However, there are many scenarios where a static light setup is insufficient, as the scene content and camera position may change. Simultaneous manual control over the camera and light position imposes a high cognitive load on the user. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach for automatic scene illumination with Fireflies. Fireflies are intelligent virtual light drones that illuminate the scene by traveling on a closed path. The Firefly path automatically adapts to changes in the scene based on an outcome-oriented energy function. To achieve interactive performance, we employ a parallel rendering pipeline for the light path evaluations. We provide a catalog of energy functions for various application scenarios and discuss the applicability of our method on several examples.","article_number":"8440109","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440109","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440109/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440109/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8547224,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"Jan. 2019","start_page":"1204","end_page":"1213","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":567,"insert_date":"20180819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Lighting","Light sources","Cameras","Optimization","Drones","Geometry","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Dynamic lighting design","lighting drones"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive","Firefly","Energy Function","Light Path","Camera Position","Camera Locations","Static Light","Scene Changes","Scene Content","Light Position","Light Source","Optimization Process","Dynamic Light","Control Points","Object Of Interest","Trajectories Of Change","Remainder Of This Section","Image Domain","Strong Light","Light System","Lighting Design","Unexpected Changes","Backlight","Backlit","Bezier Curve","Cubic Bézier","Bézier Curves","Side Of The Object","Scientific Visualization","Simple Shapes","Latin Hypercube Sampling","Shape Perception","Pool Of Workers"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864845","title":"DT-MRI Streamsurfaces Revisited","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":120,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Bonn","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547426","id":37086547426,"full_name":"Michael Ankele","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bonn"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Bonn","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606352800","id":37606352800,"full_name":"Thomas Schultz","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bonn"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"DT-MRI streamsurfaces, defined as surfaces that are everywhere tangential to the major and medium eigenvector fields, have been proposed as a tool for visualizing regions of predominantly planar behavior in diffusion tensor MRI. Even though it has long been known that their construction assumes that the involved eigenvector fields satisfy an integrability condition, it has never been tested systematically whether this condition is met in real-world data. We introduce a suitable and efficiently computable test to the visualization literature, demonstrate that it can be used to distinguish integrable from nonintegrable configurations in simulations, and apply it to whole-brain datasets of 15 healthy subjects. We conclude that streamsurface integrability is approximately satisfied in a substantial part of the brain, but not everywhere, including some regions of planarity. As a consequence, algorithms for streamsurface extraction should explicitly test local integrability. Finally, we propose a novel patch-based approach to streamsurface visualization that reduces visual artifacts, and is shown to more fully sample the extent of streamsurfaces.","article_number":"8440056","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8440056","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440056/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440056/","publication_title":"IEEE
