The topological analysis of these data sets reduces the information, but one is usually still left with too many details for interpretation. In this paper, we present a simplification approach that removes pairs of critical points from the data set, based on relevance measures. In contrast to earlier methods, no grid changes are necessary, since the whole method uses small local changes of the vector values defining the vector field. An interpretation in terms of bifurcations underlines the continuous, natural flavor of the algorithm.","article_number":"964507","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=964507","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964507/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964507/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization, 2001.

ARCHAVE is implemented in a Cave. The evaluation studied researchers analyzing lamp and coin finds throughout the excavation trenches at the Petra Great Temple site in Jordan. Experienced archaeologists used our system to study excavation data, confirming existing hypotheses and postulating new theories they had not been able to discover without the system. ARCHAVE provided access to the excavation database, and researchers were able to examine the data in the context of a life-size representation of the present-day architectural ruins of the temple. They also had access to a miniature model for site-wide analysis. Because users quickly became comfortable with the interface, they concentrated their efforts on examining the data being retrieved and displayed. The immersive VR visualization of the recovered information gave them the opportunity to explore it in a new and dynamic way and, in several cases, enabled them to make discoveries that opened new lines of investigation about the excavation.","article_number":"964560","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=964560","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964560/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964560/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization, 2001.

One of the inhibiting reasons is the lack of general methods for data-analysis and simple interfaces for data exploration. An error-and-trial iterative procedure is often used to select a desirable transfer function or mine the dataset for salient iso-values. New semi-automatic methods that are also data-centric have shown much promise. However, general and robust methods are still needed for data-exploration and analysis. In this paper, we propose general model-independent statistical methods based on central moments of data.

These maps have a single value derived at every grid cell and standard techniques are used to visualize them. Current tools fall short, however, when it is necessary to describe a distribution of values at each grid cell. Distributions may represent a frequency of occurrence over time, frequency of occurrence from multiple runs of an ensemble forecast or possible values from an uncertainty model. We identify these \"distribution data sets\" and present a case study to visualize such 2D distributions. Distribution data sets are different from multivariate data sets in the sense that the values are for a single variable instead of multiple variables. Data for this case study consists of multiple realizations of percent forest cover, generated using a geostatistical technique that combines ground measurements and satellite imagery to model uncertainty about forest cover. We present two general approaches for analyzing and visualizing such data sets. The first is a pixel-wise analysis of the probability density functions for the 2D image while the second is an analysis of features identified within the image. Such pixel-wise and feature-wise views will give Earth scientists a more complete understanding of distribution data sets.

It is hard for forecasters to get the entire picture of the atmosphere using these methods. The problems apparent in 2D with comparing and correlating multiple layers are overcome simply by adding a dimension. This is important because pertinent features in the data sets may lie in multiple layers and span several time steps. However, simply using a three-dimensional (3D) approach is not enough. The capacity for analysis of small-scale, but important, features in 2D are lost when transitioning to 3D. We propose that 3D's advantages can be incorporated with 2D's small-scale analysis by using an immersive virtual environment. In this case study, we evaluate our current standing with the project: have we met our goals, and how should we proceed from this point? To evaluate our application, we invited meteorologists to use the application to explore a data set. Then we presented our goals and asked which ones had we met, from a meteorologist's perspective. The results qualitatively reflected that our application was effective and further research would be worthwhile.","article_number":"964559","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=964559","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964559/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964559/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization, 2001.

Beichman et al., 1999). The goal of this mission is to search for chemical signatures of life in distant solar systems using five satellites flying in formation to simulate a large telescope. To design and visually verify such a delicate mission, one has to analyze and interact with many different 3D spacecraft trajectories, which is often difficult in 2D. We employ a novel trajectory design approach using invariant manifold theory, which is best understood and utilized in an immersive setting. The visualization also addresses multi-scale issues related to the vast differences in distance, velocity, and time at different phases of the mission. Additionally, the parameterization and coordinate frames used for numerical simulations may not be suitable for direct visualization. Relative motion presents a more serious problem where the patterns of the trajectories can only be viewed in particular rotating frames. Some of these problems are greatly relieved by using interactive, animated stereo 3D visualization in a semi-immersive environment such as a Responsive Workbench. Others were solved using standard techniques such as a stratify approach with multiple windows to address the multiscale issues, re-parameterizations of trajectories and associated 2D manifolds and relative motion of the camera to \"evoke\" the desired patterns.","article_number":"964562","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=964562","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964562/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964562/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization, 2001.

The time-consuming video production caused by the manual delineation of structures, software based volume rendering, and the interactive definition of an optimized camera path is considerably improved with a fully automatic strategy. Therefore, a previously suggested approach (C. Rezk-Salama, 2000) is applied which uses an optimized transfer function as a template and automatically adapts it to an individual dataset. Furthermore, we introduce hardware-accelerated morphologic filtering in order to detect the location of mid-size and giant aneurysms. The actual generation of the video is finally integrated into a hardware accelerated off-screen rendering process based on 3D texture mapping, ensuring fast visualization of high quality. Overall, clinical routine can be considerably assisted by providing a Web based service combining automatic detection and standardized visualization.","article_number":"964542","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=964542","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964542/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964542/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization, 2001.

Since most of the cortical activity occurs on these folds, it is desirable to be able to view the entire surface of the brain in a single view. This can be achieved using quasi-conformal flat maps of the cortical surface. Computational and visualization tools are now needed to be able to interact with these flat maps of the brain to gain information about spatial and functional relationships that might not otherwise be apparent. Such information can contribute to earlier diagnostic tools for diseases and improved treatment.

A correlation coefficient is used to quantify similarity in response for various regions during an experimental setting. Since the functional inter-relationships can become rather complex and spatially widespread, they are best understood in the context of the underlying 3-D brain anatomy. However despite the power of the 3-D model, the relative location of ROIs in 3-D can be obscured due the inherent problem of presenting 3-D spatial information on a 2-D screen. In order to address this problem, we have explored a number of visualization techniques to aid the brain researcher in exploring the spatial relationships of brain activity. In this paper we present a novel 3-D interface that allows the interactive exploration of correlation datasets.","article_number":"964556","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=964556","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964556/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964556/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization, 2001.

Though they have not received widespread attention, multi-dimensional transfer functions are a very effective way to extract specific material boundaries and convey subtle surface properties. However, identifying good transfer functions is difficult enough in one dimension, let alone two or three dimensions. This paper demonstrates an important class of three-dimensional transfer functions for scalar data (based on data value, gradient magnitude, and a second directional derivative), and describes a set of direct manipulation widgets which make specifying such transfer functions intuitive and convenient. We also describe how to use modem graphics hardware to interactively render with multi-dimensional transfer functions. The transfer functions, widgets, and hardware combine to form a powerful system for interactive volume exploration.","article_number":"964519","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=964519","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964519/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964519/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization, 2001.

Contrary to the trend of increasingly elaborate algorithms for large-scale terrain visualization, our algorithms and data structures have been designed with the primary goal of simplicity and efficiency of implementation. Our approach to managing large terrain data also departs from more conventional strategies based on data tiling. Rather than emphasizing how to segment and efficiently bring data in and out of memory, we focus on the manner in which the data is laid out to achieve good memory coherency for data accesses made in a top-down (coarse-to-fine) refinement of the terrain. We present and compare the results of using several different data indexing schemes, and propose a simple to compute index that yields substantial improvements in locality and speed over more commonly used data layouts. Our second contribution is a new and simple, yet easy to generalize method for view-dependent refinement. Similar to several published methods in this area, we use longest edge bisection in a top-down traversal of the mesh hierarchy to produce a continuous surface with subdivision connectivity. In tandem with the refinement, we perform view frustum culling and triangle stripping. These three components are done together in a single pass over the mesh. We show how this framework supports virtually any error metric, while still being highly memory and compute efficient.","article_number":"964533","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=964533","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964533/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964533/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization, 2001.

In this paper, we present a method for performing adaptive simplification of polygonal meshes that are too large to fit in-core. Our algorithm performs two passes over an input mesh. In the first pass, the model is quantized using a uniform grid, and surface information is accumulated in the form of quadrics and dual quadrics. This sampling is then used to construct a BSP-tree in which the partitioning planes are determined by the dual quadrics. In the final pass, the original vertices are clustered using the BSP-tree, yielding an adaptive approximation of the original mesh. The BSP-tree describes a natural simplification hierarchy, making it possible to generate a progressive transmission and construct level-of-detail representations. In this way, the algorithm provides some of the features associated with more expensive edge contraction methods while maintaining greater computational efficiency. In addition to performing adaptive simplification, our algorithm exhibits output-sensitive memory requirements and allows fine control over the size of the simplified mesh.","article_number":"964503","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=964503","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964503/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964503/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization, 2001.

The original OoCS algorithm has memory complexity that depends on the size of the output mesh, but no dependency on the size of the input mesh. That is, it can be used to simplify meshes of arbitrarily large size, but the complexity of the output mesh is limited by the amount of memory available. Our first contribution is a version of OoCS that removes the dependency of having enough memory to hold (even) the simplified mesh. With our new algorithm, the whole process is made essentially independent of the available memory on the host computer. Our new technique uses disk instead of main memory, but it is carefully designed to avoid costly random accesses. Our two other contributions improve the quality of the approximations generated by OoCS.

To avoid aliasing artifacts, we introduce the concept of a resampling filter combining a reconstruction with a low-pass kernel. Because of the similarity to Heckbert's EWA (elliptical weighted average) filter for texture mapping we call our technique EWA volume splatting. It provides high image quality without aliasing artifacts or excessive blurring even with non-spherical kernels. Hence it is suitable for regular, rectilinear, and irregular volume data sets. Moreover, our framework introduces a novel approach to compute the footprint function. It facilitates efficient perspective projection of arbitrary elliptical kernels at very little additional cost. Finally, we show that EWA volume reconstruction kernels can be reduced to surface reconstruction kernels. This makes our splat primitive universal in reconstructing surface and volume data.","article_number":"964490","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=964490","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964490/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964490/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization, 2001.

However, a fast-developing trend is the use of visualization techniques to give new insights into performance, style, and strategy of the players. Automated techniques can extract accurate information from video about player performance that not even the most skilled observer is able to discern. When presented as static images or as a three-dimensional virtual replay, this information makes viewing a game an entirely new and exciting experience. This paper presents one such sports visualization system called LucentVision, which has been developed for the sport of tennis. LucentVision uses real-time video analysis to obtain motion trajectories of players and the ball, and offers a rich set of visualization options based on this trajectory data. The system has been used extensively in the broadcast of international tennis tournaments, both on television and the Internet.","article_number":"964496","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=964496","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964496/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964496/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization, 2001.

We analyze different families and orders of wavelets for compression ratio and the introduced error. We use a quantization that has been optimized for the visual impression of the reconstructed volume, independent of the viewing algorithm. This enables us to achieve very high compression ratios while still being able to reconstruct the volume with as few visual artifacts as possible. A further improvement of the compression ratio has been achieved by applying a motion compensation scheme to exploit temporal coherency. Using these schemes, we are able to decompress each volume of our animation at interactive frame rates, while visualizing these decompressed volumes on a single PC. We also present a number of improved visualization algorithms for high-quality display using OpenGL hardware running at interactive frame rates on a standard PC.","article_number":"964531","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=964531","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964531/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964531/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization, 2001.

To do so, we conducted experiments in which we mapped various color scales onto the intensity values of a digitized photograph of a face and asked observers to rate each image. We found a very strong correlation between the perceived naturalness of the images and the degree to which the underlying color scales increased monotonically in luminance. Color scales that did not include a monotonically increasing luminance component produced no positive rating scores. Since color scales with monotonic luminance profiles are widely recommended for visualizing continuous scalar data, a purely visual technique for identifying such color scales could be very useful, especially in situations where color calibration is not integrated into the visualization environment, such as over the Internet.","article_number":"964510","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=964510","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964510/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964510/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization, 2001.

We present an algorithm for tightly integrating the two into a single hierarchical data structure. The trade-off between rendering portions of a model with points or with polygons is made automatically. Our approach to this problem is to apply a bottom-up simplification process involving not only polygon simplification operations, but point replacement and point simplification operations as well. Given one or more surface meshes, our algorithm produces a hybrid hierarchy comprising both polygon and point primitives. This hierarchy may be optimized according to the relative performance characteristics of these primitive types on the intended rendering platform. We also provide a range of aggressiveness for performing point replacement operations. The most conservative approach produces a hierarchy that is better than a purely polygonal hierarchy in some places, and roughly equal in others. A less conservative approach can trade reduced complexity at the far viewing ranges for some increased complexity at the near viewing ranges. We demonstrate our approach on a number of input models, achieving primitive counts that are 1.3 to 4.7 times smaller than those of triangle-only simplification.","article_number":"964491","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=964491","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964491/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964491/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization, 2001.

We propose a computationally efficient method for the automated detection of intensity transitions in volume data. In this approach, the dominant transitions correspond to clear maxima in cumulative Laplacian-weighted gray value histograms. Only one pass through the data volume is required to compute the histogram. Several other features which may be useful for exploration of data of unknown origin can be efficiently computed in a similar manner. The detected intensity transitions can be used for setting of visualization parameters for surface rendering, as well as for direct volume rendering of 3D datasets. When using surface rendering, the detected dominant intensity transition values correspond to the optimal surface isovalues for extraction of boundaries of the objects of interest. In direct volume rendering, such transitions are important for generation of the transfer functions, which are used to assign visualization properties to data voxels and determine the appearance of the rendered image. The proposed method is illustrated by examples with synthetic data as well as real biomedical datasets.","article_number":"964515","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=964515","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964515/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964515/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization, 2001.

We introduce a technique that detects and corrects transient shadows in a multi-projector display. Our approach is to minimize the difference between predicted (generated) and observed (camera) images by continuous modification of the projected image values for each display device. We speculate that the general predictive monitoring framework introduced here is capable of addressing more general radiometric consistency problems. Using an automatically-derived relative position of cameras and projectors in the display environment and a straightforward color correction scheme, the system renders an expected image for each camera location. Cameras observe the displayed image, which is compared with the expected image to detect shadowed regions. These regions are transformed to the appropriate projector frames, where corresponding pixel values are increased. In display regions where more than one projector contributes to the image, shadow regions are eliminated. We demonstrate an implementation of the technique in a multiprojector system.","article_number":"964509","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=964509","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964509/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964509/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization, 2001.

Grid structures based on a Cartesian lattice are the de-facto standard for regular representations of volumetric data. In this paper we introduce a more general concept of regular grids for the representation of volumetric data. We demonstrate that a specific type of regular lattice-the so-called body-centered cubic-is able to represent the same data set as a Cartesian grid to the same accuracy but with 29.3% fewer samples. This speeds up traditional volume rendering algorithms by the same ratio, which we demonstrate by adopting a splatting implementation for these new lattices. We investigate different filtering methods required for computing the normals on this lattice. The lattice representation results also in lossless compression ratios that are better than previously reported. Although other regular grid structures achieve the same sample efficiency, the body-centered cubic is particularly easy to use. The only assumption necessary is that the underlying volume is isotropic and band-limited-an assumption that is valid for most practical data sets.","article_number":"964498","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=964498","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964498/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964498/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization, 2001.

Our approach is based on the construction of a C/sup 1/-continuous bivariate cubic spline and our method offers optimal approximation order. Both local variation and nonuniform distribution of the data are taken into account by using local polynomial least squares approximations of varying degree. Since we only need to solve small linear systems and no triangulation of the scattered data points is required, the overall complexity of the algorithm is linear in the total number of points. Numerical examples dealing with several real-world scattered data sets with up to millions of points demonstrate the efficiency of our method. The resulting spline surface is of high visual quality and can be efficiently evaluated for rendering and modeling. In our implementation we achieve real-time frame rates for typical fly-through sequences and interactive frame rates for recomputing and rendering a locally modified spline surface.","article_number":"964530","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=964530","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964530/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964530/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization, 2001.

In order to display volume data that successively undergoes color lookups, however, the data structures have to be re-built continuously. In this paper we propose a technique that circumvents this drawback using hardware accelerated texture mapping. In a first rendering pass we employ graphics hardware to interactively determine for each ray where the material is hit. In a second pass ray-casting is performed, but ray traversal starts right in front of the previously determined regions. The algorithm enables interactive classification and it considerably accelerates the view dependent display of selected materials and surfaces from volume data. In contrast to other techniques that are solely based on texture mapping our approach requires less memory and accurately performs the composition of material contributions along the ray.","article_number":"964521","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=964521","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964521/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964521/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization, 2001.

Two methods used different distributions of short arrows, two used different distributions of integral curves, one used wedges located to suggest flow lines, and the final one was line-integral convolution (LIC). We defined three simple but representative tasks for users to perform using visualizations from each method: (1) locating all critical points in an image, (2) identifying critical point types, and (3) advecting a particle. The results show different strengths and weaknesses for each method. We found that users performed better with methods that: (1) showed the sign of vectors within the vector field, (2) visually represented integral curves, and (3) visually represented the locations of critical points. These results provide quantitative support for some of the anecdotal evidence concerning visualization methods. The tasks and testing framework also provide a basis for comparing other visualization methods, for creating more effective methods and for defining additional tasks to further understand tradeoffs among methods. They may also be useful for evaluating 2D vectors on 2D surfaces embedded in 3D and for defining analogous tasks for 3D visualization methods.","article_number":"964505","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=964505","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964505/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964505/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization, 2001.

View-dependent rendering provides the ability to change level of detail over the surface seamlessly and smoothly in real-time. The exclusive use of view-parameters to perform level-of-detail selection causes even occluded regions to be rendered in high level of detail. To overcome this serious drawback we have integrated occlusion culling into the level selection mechanism. Because computing exact visibility is expensive and it is currently not possible to perform this computation in real time, we use a visibility estimation technique instead. Our approach reduces dramatically the resolution at occluded regions.","article_number":"964534","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=964534","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964534/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964534/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization, 2001.

The algorithm is based largely on the existing mesh compression algorithms, most of which require an 'in-core' representation of the input mesh. Our solution is to partition the mesh into smaller submeshes and compress these submeshes separately using existing mesh compression techniques. Since a direct partition of the input mesh is out of question, instead we partition a simplified mesh and use the partition on the simplified model to obtain a partition on the original model. In order to recover the full connectivity, we present a simple scheme for encoding/decoding the resulting boundary structure from the mesh partition. When compressing large models with few singular vertices, a negligible portion of the compressed output is devoted to gluing information. On desktop computers, we have run experiments on models with millions of vertices, which could not be compressed using standard compression software packages, and have observed compression ratios as high as 17 to 1 using our technique.","article_number":"964532","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=964532","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964532/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964532/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization, 2001.

Measured sorting times are comparable to previously published algorithms, which are, however, restricted to acyclic meshes. In practice, our algorithm is also useful for acyclic meshes as numerical instabilities can lead to false visibility cycles. Our method includes a simple, hardware-assisted algorithm based on image compositing that renders visibility cycles correctly. For tetrahedral meshes this algorithm allows us to render each tetrahedral cell (whether it is part of a cycle or not) by hardware-accelerated cell-projection.

A high quality distance field facilitates accurate surface characterization and gradient estimation. However, due to Nyquist's law, no existing volumetric methods based on the linear sampling theory can fully capture surface details, such as comers and edges, in 3D space. We propose a novel complete distance field representation (CDFR) that does not rely on Nyquist's sampling theory. To accomplish this, we construct a volume where each voxel has a complete description of all portions of surface that affect the local distance field. For any desired distance, we are able to extract a surface contour in true Euclidean distance, at any level of accuracy, from the same CDFR representation. Such point-based iso-distance contours have faithful per-point gradients and can be interactively visualized using splatting, providing per-point shaded image quality. We also demonstrate applying CDFR to a cutting edge design for manufacturing application involving high-complexity parts at unprecedented accuracy using only commonly available computational resources.","article_number":"964518","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=964518","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964518/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964518/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization, 2001.

The algorithm guarantees that the topological genus of the generated mesh is the same as the genus of the surface embedded in the volume dataset at all levels of detail. In addition to this \"hard constraint\" on the genus of the mesh, the user can choose to specify some number of soft geometric constraints, such as triangle aspect ratio, minimum or maximum total number of vertices, minimum and/or maximum triangle edge lengths, maximum magnitude of various error metrics per triangle or vertex, including maximum curvature (area) error, maximum distance to the surface, and others. The mesh extraction process is fully automatic and does not require manual adjusting of parameters to produce the desired results as long as the user does not specify incompatible constraints. The algorithm robustly handles special topological cases, such as trimmed surfaces (intersections of the surface with the volume boundary), and manifolds with multiple disconnected components (several closed surfaces embedded in the same volume dataset). The meshes may self-intersect at coarse resolutions. However, the self-intersections are corrected automatically as the resolution of the meshes increase. We show several examples of meshes extracted from complex volume datasets.","article_number":"964524","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=964524","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964524/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964524/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization, 2001.

Boundaries, non-smoothness and small features create undersampling problems, whereas oversampling leads to too many triangles. We use Voronoi cell geometry as a unified guide to detect undersampling and oversampling. We apply these detections in surface reconstruction and model simplification.

Two of the algorithms presented take advantage of hardware accelerated polygon rendering and 2D texture mapping. In exploiting new features of modem PC graphics adapters, the first algorithm tries to significantly minimize the number of polygons to be rendered. Reducing rasterization requirements is the main goal of the second algorithm, which distributes the computational workload differently between the main processor and the graphics chip. By comparing them to a new pure software approach, an optimal software-hardware balance is studied.

Its aim is to represent transport phenomena governed by time-dependent vector fields in an intuitively understandable way, using images and animations. Here we pick up the recently presented anisotropic diffusion method, expand and generalize it to allow a multiscale visualization of long-term, complex transport problems. Instead of streamline type patterns generated by the original method now streakline patterns are generated and advected. This process obeys a nonlinear transport diffusion equation with typically dominant transport. Starting from some noisy initial image, the diffusion actually generates and enhances patterns which are then transported in the direction of the flow field. Simultaneously the image is again sharpened in the direction orthogonal to the flow field. A careful adjustment of the models parameters is derived to balance diffusion and transport effects in a reasonable way. Properties of the method can be discussed for the continuous model, which is solved by an efficient upwind finite element discretization. As characteristic for the class of multiscale image processing methods, we can in advance select a suitable scale for representing the flow field.","article_number":"964494","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=964494","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964494/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964494/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization, 2001.

Slicing-based volume rendering is also considered. The CIEL data structure represents all the combinatorial information of the grid, making it possible to optimize the classical propagation from local minima paradigm. The usual geometric structures are replaced by a more efficient combinatorial structure. An active edges list is maintained, and iteratively propagated from an iso-surface to the next one in a very efficient way. The intersected cells incident to each active edge are retrieved, and the intersection polygons are generated by circulating around their facets. This latter feature enables arbitrary irregular cells to be treated, such as those encountered in certain computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Since the CIEL data structure solely depends on the connections between the cells, it is possible to take into account dynamic changes in the geometry of the mesh and in property values, which only requires the sorted extrema list to be updated. Experiments have shown that our approach is significantly faster than classical methods. The major drawback of our method is its memory consumption, higher than most classical methods. However, experimental results show that it stays within a practical range.","article_number":"964511","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=964511","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964511/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964511/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization, 2001.

By assigning voxels to distinct objects within the volume and by using an individual setup and combination of look-up tables for each object, object-aware rendering is performed: different transfer functions, shading models, and also compositing modes can be mixed within a single scene to depict each object in the most appropriate way, while still providing rendering results in real-time. While providing frame rates similar to volume visualization using 3D consumer hardware, the approach utilized by RTVR offers much more flexibility and extensibility due to its pure software nature. Furthermore, due to the memory-efficiency of the data representation and the implementation in Java, RTVR can be used to provide volume viewing facilities over low-bandwidth networks, with almost full control over rendering and visualization mapping parameters (clipping, shading, compositing, transfer function) for the user.

To allow this, we view a scientific dataset as a triangulated mesh of data elements, where the attributes embedded in each element form a set of properties arrayed across the surface of the mesh. Existing simplification techniques were not designed to address the high dimensionality that exists in these types of datasets. In addition, vertex operations that relocate, insert, or remove data elements may need to be modified or restricted. Principal component analysis provides an algorithm-independent method for compressing a dataset's dimensionality during simplification. Vertex locking forces certain data elements to maintain their spatial locations; this technique is also used to guarantee a minimum density in the simplified dataset. The result is a visualization that significantly reduces the number of data elements to display, while at the same time ensuring that high-variance regions of potential interest remain intact. We apply our techniques to a number of well-known feature preserving algorithms, and demonstrate their applicability in a real-world context by simplifying a multidimensional weather dataset.

We propose a novel opacity classification algorithm for 3D ultrasound datasets, based on the variational principle. More specifically, we compute a volumetric opacity function that optimally satisfies a set of simultaneous requirements. One requirement makes the function attain nonzero values only in the vicinity of a user-specified value, resulting in soft shells of finite, approximately constant thickness around isosurfaces in the volume. Other requirements are designed to make the function smoother and less sensitive to noise and speckle. The computed opacity function lends itself well to explicit geometric surface extraction, as well as to direct volume rendering at interactive rates. We also describe a new splatting algorithm that is particularly well suited for displaying soft opacity shells. Several examples and comparisons are included to illustrate our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness on real 3D ultrasound datasets.","article_number":"964539","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=964539","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964539/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964539/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization, 2001.

In contrast to previous wavelet schemes, our algorithm creates a parametrization of a scalar field induced by its contours and compactly stores this parametrization rather than function values sampled on a regular grid. Our representation is based on hierarchical polygon meshes with subdivision connectivity whose vertices are transformed into wavelet coefficients. From this sparse set of coefficients, every set of contours can be efficiently reconstructed at multiple levels of resolution. When applying lossy compression, introducing high quantization errors, our method preserves contour topology, in contrast to compression methods applied to the corresponding field function. We provide numerical results for scalar fields defined on planar domains. Our approach generalizes to volumetric domains, time-varying contours, and level sets of vector fields.","article_number":"964525","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=964525","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964525/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964525/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization, 2001.

However, it is often necessary to model nonmanifold surfaces, such as several surface patches meeting at a common boundary. In this paper, we describe a subdivision algorithm that makes it possible to model nonmanifold surfaces. Any triangle mesh, subject only to the restriction that no two vertices of any triangle coincide, can serve as an input to the algorithm. Resulting surfaces consist of collections of manifold patches joined along nonmanifold curves and vertices. If desired, constraints may be imposed on the tangent planes of manifold patches sharing a curve or a vertex. The algorithm is an extension of a well-known Loop subdivision scheme, and uses techniques developed for piecewise smooth surfaces.","article_number":"964528","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=964528","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964528/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964528/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization, 2001.

A preprocessing step is described in which a linear image basis is developed and a lighting-independent formulation defined. A reflection function, similar to hemispherical reflectance, approximates normal Lambertian shading. Intensity errors resulting from this approximation are reduced by use of a polynomial gamma correction function and scaling to a normalized display range. This produces images that are similar to normal Lambertian shading without employing the maximum (max) function. For a single object view, images can then be expressed in a linear form so that lighting direction can be factored out. During normal rendering, image quantities for arbitrary light directions can be found without rendering. This method is demonstrated for estimating image intensity and level-of-detail error prior to rendering an object.","article_number":"964535","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=964535","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964535/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/964535/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization, 2001.
