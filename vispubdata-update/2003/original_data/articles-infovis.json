However, node link diagrams often fall short when used to visualize large graph structures. In this paper we investigate the use of call matrices as visual aids in the management of large software projects. We argue that call matrices have a number of advantages over traditional node link diagrams when the main object of interest is the link instead of the node. Matrix visualizations can provide stable and crisp layouts of large graphs and are inherently well suited for large multilevel visualizations because of their recursive structure. We discuss a number of visualization issues, using a very large software project currently under development at Philips Medical Systems as a running example.","article_number":"1249030","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1249030","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249030/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249030/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization 2003 (IEEE Cat.

One such ambiguity is overlap or occlusion that occurs when the number of records exceeds the number of unique locations in the presentation or when there exist two or more records that map to the same location. To lessen the affect of occlusion, non-standard visual attributes (i.e. shading and/or transparency) are applied, or such records may be remapped to a corresponding jittered location. The resulting mapping efficiently portrays the crowding of records but fails to provide the insight into the relationship between the neighboring records. We introduce a new interactive technique that intelligibly organizes overlapped points, a neural network-based smart jittering algorithm. We demonstrate this technique on a scatter plot, the most widely used visualization. The algorithm can be applied to other one, two, and multi-dimensional visualizations which represent data as points, including 3-dimensional scatter plots, RadViz, polar coordinates.","article_number":"1249018","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1249018","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249018/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249018/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization 2003 (IEEE Cat.

Serious studies consist of numerous questions and contain answers from large population samples.

Traditional ways of presenting the results are limited to one-dimensional charts and cross-tables. We developed a visualization method called the Parallel Coordinate Tree that combines multidimensional analysis with a tree structure representation. Distortion-oriented focus+context techniques are used to facilitate interaction with the visualization.

The most computationally complex stage of the original model involved performing a nearest-neighbour search for every data item. The complexity of this phase has been reduced by treating all high-dimensional relationships as a set of discretised distances to a constant number of randomly selected pivot items. In improving this computational bottleneck, the complexity is reduced to from O(N/sub 1/2 /N) to O(N/sub 5/4/). As well as documenting this improvement, the paper describes evaluation with a data set of 108000 14-dimensional items; a considerable increase on the size of data previously tested. Results illustrate that the reduction in complexity is reflected in significantly improved run times and that no negative impact is made upon the quality of layout produced.","article_number":"1249012","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1249012","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249012/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249012/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization 2003 (IEEE Cat.

Presenting such things as scale and detail take on new meaning when they can be displayed life-size and not shown in the context of one or many small frames such as we see everywhere.

Examples include electrical and telecommunication networks, Web structures, and airline routes. The problem is that graphs of these real world data sets have many interconnected nodes, ultimately leading to edge congestion: the density of edges is so great that they obscure nodes, individual edges, and even the visual information beneath the graph. To address this problem we developed an interactive technique called EdgeLens. An EdgeLens interactively curves graph edges away for a person's focus attention without changing the node positions. This opens up sufficient space to disambiguate node and edge relationships and to see underlying information while still preserving node layout. Initially two methods of creating this interaction were developed and compared in a user study. The results of this study were used in the selection of a basic approach and the subsequent development of the EdgeLens. We then improved the EdgeLens through use of transparency and colour and by allowing multiple lenses to appear on the graph.","article_number":"1249008","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1249008","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249008/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249008/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization 2003 (IEEE Cat.

Users often switch between these views. We discuss how smooth animations from one view to another can be defined. To this end, a metric on the effect of simultaneous zooming and panning is defined, based on an estimate of the perceived velocity. Optimal is defined as smooth and efficient.

Currently, most dynamic information that is displayed in public places consists of text and numbers. We argue that information visualization can be employed to make such dynamic data more useful and appealing. However, visualizations intended for non-desktop spaces will have to both provide valuable information and present an attractive addition to the environment - they must strike a balance between aesthetical appeal and usefulness. To explore this, we designed a real-time visualization of bus departure times and deployed it in a public space, with about 300 potential users. To make the presentation more visually appealing, we took inspiration from a modern abstract artist. The visualization was designed in two passes. First, we did a preliminary version that was presented to and discussed with prospective users. Based on their input, we did a final design. We discuss the lessons learned in designing this and previous ambient information visualizations, including how visual art can be used as a design constraint, and how the choice of information and the placement of the display affect the visualization.","article_number":"1249031","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1249031","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249031/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249031/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization 2003 (IEEE Cat.

There is an increasing interest in statistically modeling the evolution of complex networks such as small-world networks and scale-free networks. In this article, we address a practical issue concerning the visualizations of co-citation networks of scientific publications derived by two widely known link reduction algorithms, namely minimum spanning trees (MSTs) and pathfinder networks (PFNETs). Our primary goal is to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the two methods in fulfilling the need for visualizing evolving networks. Two criteria are derived for assessing visualizations of evolving networks in terms of topological properties and dynamical properties. We examine the animated visualization models of the evolution of botulinum toxin research in terms of its co-citation structure across a 58-year span (1945-2002). The results suggest that although high-degree nodes dominate the structure of MST models, such structures can be inadequate in depicting the essence of how the network evolves because MST removes potentially significant links from high-order shortest paths. In contrast, PFNET models clearly demonstrate their superiority in maintaining the cohesiveness of some of the most pivotal paths, which in turn make the growth animation more predictable and interpretable. We suggest that the design of visualization and modeling tools for network evolution should take the cohesiveness of critical paths into account.","article_number":"1249010","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1249010","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249010/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249010/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization 2003 (IEEE Cat.

Even more so, when information on the clustering (labeling) decomposition of the data is known, this information can be integrated in the linear transformation, resulting in embeddings that clearly show the separation between the clusters, as well as their infrastructure. All this makes our technique very flexible and powerful, and lets us cope with kinds of data that other techniques fail to describe properly.","article_number":"1249017","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1249017","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249017/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249017/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization 2003 (IEEE Cat.

The approach leverages the component-based architecture implemented in GeoVISTA Studio to construct a flexible, multiview, tightly (but generically) coordinated, EDA toolkit. This toolkit builds upon traditional ideas behind both small multiples and scatterplot matrices in three fundamental ways. First, we develop a general, multiform, bivariate matrix and a complementary multiform, bivariate small multiple plot in which different bivariate representation forms can be used in combination. We demonstrate the flexibility of this approach with matrices and small multiples that depict multivariate data through combinations of: scatterplots, bivariate maps, and space-filling displays. Second, we apply a measure of conditional entropy to (a) identify variables from a high-dimensional data set that are likely to display interesting relationships and (b) generate a default order of these variables in the matrix or small multiple display. Third, we add conditioning, a kind of dynamic query/filtering in which supplementary (undisplayed) variables are used to constrain the view onto variables that are displayed. Conditioning allows the effects of one or more well understood variables to be removed form the analysis, making relationships among remaining variables easier to explore. We illustrate the individual and combined functionality enabled by this approach through application to analysis of cancer diagnosis and mortality data and their associated covariates and risk factors.","article_number":"1249006","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1249006","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249006/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249006/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization 2003 (IEEE Cat.

Effective dimension management, such as dimension ordering, spacing and filtering, is critical for visual exploration of such datasets. Dimension ordering and spacing explicitly reveal dimension relationships in arrangement-sensitive multidimensional visualization techniques, such as parallel coordinates, star glyphs, and pixel-oriented techniques. They facilitate the visual discovery of patterns within the data. Dimension filtering hides some of the dimensions to reduce clutter while preserving the major information of the dataset. In this paper, we propose an interactive hierarchical dimension ordering, spacing and filtering approach, called DOSFA. DOSFA is based on dimension hierarchies derived from similarities among dimensions. It is scalable multi-resolution approach making dimensional management a tractable task. On the one hand, it automatically generates default settings for dimension ordering, spacing and filtering. On the other hand, it allows users to efficiently control all aspects of this dimension management process via visual interaction tools for dimension hierarchy manipulation. A case study visualizing a dataset containing over 200 dimensions reveals high dimensional visualization techniques.","article_number":"1249015","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1249015","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249015/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249015/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization 2003 (IEEE Cat.

We have developed a system called FundExplorer that implements a distorted treemap to visualize both the amount of money invested in a person's fund portfolio and the context of remaining market stocks. The FundExplorer system enables people to interactively explore diversification possibilities with their portfolios.","article_number":"1249027","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1249027","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249027/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249027/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization 2003 (IEEE Cat.

We present an adaptive visualization technique based on data stratification to ingest stream information adaptively when influx rate exceeds processing rate. We also describe an incremental visualization technique based on data fusion to project new information directly onto a visualization subspace spanned by the singular vectors of the previously processed neighboring data. The ultimate goal is to leverage the value of legacy and new information and minimize re-processing of the entire dataset in full resolution.

One of the more common procedures for microarray experimentation is that of the microarray time-course experiment. The product of microarray time-course experiment is time-series data, which subject to proper analysis has the potential to have significant impact on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases. While existing information visualization techniques go some way to making microarray time-series data more manageable, requirements analysis has revealed significant limitations. The main finding was that users were unable to uncover and quantify common changes in value over a specified time-period. This paper describes a novel technique that provides this functionality by allowing the user to visually formulate and modify measurable queries with separate time-period and condition components. These visual queries are supported by the combination of a traditional value against time graph representation of the data with a complementary scatter-plot representation of a specified time-period. The multiple views of the visualization are coordinated so that the user can formulate and modify queries with rapid reversible display of query results in the traditional value against time graph format.","article_number":"1249023","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1249023","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249023/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249023/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization 2003 (IEEE Cat.

Unfortunately, most existing visual exploration displays are designed to handle numeric variables only. When importing data sets with nominal values into such visualization tools, most solutions to date are rather simplistic. Often, techniques that map nominal values to numbers do not assign order or spacing among the values in a manner that conveys semantic relationships. Moreover, displays designed for nominal variables usually cannot handle high cardinality variables well. This paper addresses the problem of how to display nominal variables in general-purpose visual exploration tools designed for numeric variables. Specifically, we investigate (1) how to assign order and spacing among the nominal values, and (2) how to reduce the number of distinct values to display. We propose that nominal variables be pre-processed using a distance-quantification-classing (DQC) approach before being imported into a visual exploration tool. In the distance step, we identify a set of independent dimensions that can be used to calculate the distance between nominal values. In the quantification step, we use the independent dimensions and the distance information to assign order and spacing among the nominal values. In the classing step, we use results from the previous steps to determine which values within a variable are similar to each other and thus can be grouped together. Each step in the DQC approach can be accomplished by a variety of techniques. We extended the XmdvTool package to incorporate this approach. We evaluated our approach on several data sets using a variety of evaluation measures.","article_number":"1249016","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1249016","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249016/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249016/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization 2003 (IEEE Cat.

We present a user study in which keyframe occlusion caused difficulties. To use the screen space most efficiently to display images, both occlusion and wasted whitespace should be minimized. Thus optimal choices will tend toward constant density displays. However, previous constant density algorithms are based on global density, which leads to occlusion and empty space if the density is not uniform. We introduce an algorithm that considers the layout of individual objects and avoids occlusion altogether. Efficiency concerns are important for dynamic summaries of the Informedia Digital Video Library, which has hundreds of thousands of shots. Posting multiple queries that take into account parameters of the visualization as well as the original query reduces the amount of work required. This greedy algorithm is then compared to an optimal one. The approach is also applicable to visualizations containing complex graphical objects other than images, such as text, icons, or trees.","article_number":"1249019","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1249019","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249019/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249019/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization 2003 (IEEE Cat.

The model takes as input an arbitrary grayscale image and returns a lattice structure describing the visual organization of the image. We show how this model captures several aspects of traditional design aesthetics, and we describe a software tool that implements the model to help designers analyze and refine visual displays.

Dynamic query sliders resulted in better performance for simple range tasks, while brushing histograms was better for complex trend evaluation and attribute relation tasks. Participants preferred brushing histograms for understanding relationships between attributes and the rich information they provided.","article_number":"1249020","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1249020","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249020/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249020/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization 2003 (IEEE Cat.

If we could design the ideal texture pattern to apply to an arbitrary smoothly curving shape to be most accurately and effectively perceived, what would the characteristics of that texture pattern be? In this paper we describe the results of a comprehensive controlled observer experiment intended to yield insight into that question. Here, we report the results of a new study comparing the relative accuracy of observers' judgments of shape type (elliptical, cylindrical, hyperbolic or flat) and shape orientation (convex, concave, both, or neither) for local views of boundary masked quadric surface patches under six different principal direction texture pattern conditions plus two texture conditions (an isotropic pattern and a non-principal direction oriented anisotropic pattern), under both perspective and orthographic projection conditions and from both head-on and oblique viewpoints. Our results confirm the hypothesis that accurate shape perception is facilitated to a statistically significantly greater extent by some principal direction texture patterns than by others. Specifically, we found that, for both views, under conditions of perspective projection, participants more often correctly identified the shape category and the shape orientation when the surface was textured with the pattern that contained oriented energy along both the first and second principal directions only than in the case of any other texture condition. Patterns containing markings following only one of the principal directions, or containing information along other directions in addition to the principal directions yielded poorer performance overall.","article_number":"1249022","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1249022","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249022/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249022/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization 2003 (IEEE Cat.

Data sets might be distinguished according to volume, variable types and distribution, and each of these characteristics imposes constraints upon the choice of applicable algorithms for their visualization. Previous work has shown that a hybrid algorithmic approach can be successful in addressing the impact of data volume on the feasibility of multidimensional scaling (MDS). This suggests that hybrid combinations of appropriate algorithms might also successfully address other characteristics of data. This paper presents a system and framework in which a user can easily explore hybrid algorithms and the data flowing through them. Visual programming and a novel algorithmic architecture let the user semi-automatically define data flows and the co-ordination of multiple views.","article_number":"1249013","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1249013","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249013/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249013/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization 2003 (IEEE Cat.
