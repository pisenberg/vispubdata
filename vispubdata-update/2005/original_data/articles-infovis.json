The advantage of flow maps is that they reduce visual clutter by merging edges. Most flow maps are drawn by hand and there are few computer algorithms available. We present a method for generating flow maps using hierarchical clustering given a set of nodes, positions, and flow data between the nodes. Our techniques are inspired by graph layout algorithms that minimize edge crossings and distort node positions while maintaining their relative position to one another. We demonstrate our technique by producing flow maps for network traffic, census data, and trade data.","article_number":"1532150","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532150","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1532150/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1532150/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization, 2005.

For visualization of a large scale dataset, user interaction is indispensable for selecting focus areas in the dataset. However, excessive switching of the visualized image makes it difficult for the user to recognize overview/ detail and detail/ detail relationships. The goal of this research is to develop techniques for visualizing details as precisely as possible in overview display. In this paper, visualization of a one-dimensional but very large dataset is considered. The proposed method is based on pseudo coloring, however, each scalar value corresponds to two discrete colors. By painting with two colors at each value, users can read out the value precisely. This method has many advantages: it requires little image space for visualization; both the overview and details of the dataset are visible in one image without distortion; and implementation is very simple. Several application examples, such as meteorological observation data and train convenience evaluation data, show the effectiveness of the method.","article_number":"1532144","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532144","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1532144/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1532144/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization, 2005.

We present a set of ten low level analysis tasks that largely capture people's activities while employing information visualization tools for understanding data. To help develop these tasks, we collected nearly 200 sample questions from students about how they would analyze five particular data sets from different domains. The questions, while not being totally comprehensive, illustrated the sheer variety of analytic questions typically posed by users when employing information visualization systems. We hope that the presented set of tasks is useful for information visualization system designers as a kind of common substrate to discuss the relative analytic capabilities of the systems. Further, the tasks may provide a form of checklist for system designers.","article_number":"1532136","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532136","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1532136/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1532136/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization, 2005.

Parallel coordinates is an excellent tool for visualizing this type of data but has its limitations. This paper deals with one of its main limitations - how to visualize a large number of data items without hiding the inherent structure they constitute. We solve this problem by constructing clusters and using high precision textures to represent them. We also use transfer functions that operate on the high precision textures in order to highlight different aspects of the cluster characteristics. Providing predefined transfer functions as well as the support to draw customized transfer functions makes it possible to extract different aspects of the data.

Methods that work very well for continuous data are often hardly usable with categorical dimensions. Only few methods deal properly with such data, mostly because of the discrete nature of categorical data, which does not translate well into the continuous domains of space and color. Parallel sets is a new visualization method that adopts the layout of parallel coordinates, but substitutes the individual data points by a frequency based representation. This abstracted view, combined with a set of carefully designed interactions, supports visual data analysis of large and complex data sets. The technique allows efficient work with meta data, which is particularly important when dealing with categorical datasets. By creating new dimensions from existing ones, for example, the user can filter the data according to his or her current needs. We also present the results from an interactive analysis of CRM data using parallel sets. We demonstrate how the flexible layout eases the process of knowledge crystallization, especially when combined with a sophisticated interaction scheme.","article_number":"1532139","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532139","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1532139/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1532139/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization, 2005.

Situational awareness is the continuous extraction of environmental information, its integration with previous knowledge to form a coherent mental picture, and the use of that picture in anticipating future events. In this paper we build on our previous work on visualization for network intrusion detection and show how that approach can be generalized to encompass a much broader class of SA systems. We first propose a generalization that is based on what we term, the w/sup 3/ premise, namely that each event must have at least the what, when and where attributes. We also present a second generalization, which increases flexibility and facilitates complex visual correlations. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of our approaches by applying our visualization paradigm in a collection of diverse SA areas.","article_number":"1532134","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532134","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1532134/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1532134/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization, 2005.

Alternatively, data from all the timepoints can be overlaid simultaneously by embedding small charts into graph vertices. These graph visualizations may also be linked to other visualizations (e.g., parallel co-ordinates) using brushing and linking. This paper describes a study performed to evaluate and rank graph+timeseries visualization options based on users' performance time and accuracy of responses on predefined tasks. The results suggest that overlaying data on graph vertices one timepoint at a time may lead to more accurate performance for tasks involving analysis of a graph at a single timepoint, and comparisons between graph vertices for two distinct timepoints. Overlaying data simultaneously for all the timepoints on graph vertices may lead to more accurate and faster performance for tasks involving searching for outlier vertices displaying different behavior than the rest of the graph vertices for all timepoints. Single views have advantage over multiple views on tasks that require topological information. Also, the number of attributes displayed on nodes has a non trivial influence on accuracy of responses, whereas the number of visualizations affect the performance time.","article_number":"1532151","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532151","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1532151/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1532151/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization, 2005.

Often a large number of time series have to be monitored and analyzed in parallel. Sets of time series may show intrinsic hierarchical relationships and varying degrees of importance among the individual time series. Effective techniques for visually analyzing large sets of time series should encode the relative importance and hierarchical ordering of the time series data by size and position, and should also provide a high degree of regularity in order to support comparability by the analyst. In this paper, we present a framework for visualizing large sets of time series. Based on the notion of inter time series importance relationships, we define a set of objective functions that space-filling layout schemes for time series data should obey. We develop an efficient algorithm addressing the identified problems by generating layouts that reflect hierarchy and importance based relationships in a regular layout with favorable aspect ratios. We apply our technique to a number of real world data sets including sales and stock data, and we compare our technique with an aspect ratio aware variant of the well known TreeMap algorithm. The examples show the advantages and practical usefulness of our layout algorithm.","article_number":"1532148","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532148","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1532148/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1532148/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization, 2005.

The method combines constraint programming techniques with a high performance force directed placement (FDP) algorithm so that the directed nature of the graph is highlighted while useful properties of FDP - such as emphasis of symmetries and preservation of proximity relations - are retained. Our algorithm automatically identifies those parts of the digraph that contain hierarchical information and draws them accordingly. Additionally, those parts that do not contain hierarchy are drawn at the same quality expected from a nonhierarchical, undirected layout algorithm. An interesting application of our algorithm is directional multidimensional scaling (DMDS). DMDS deals with low dimensional embedding of multivariate data where we want to emphasize the overall flow in the data (e.g. chronological progress) along one of the axes.","article_number":"1532130","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532130","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1532130/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1532130/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization, 2005.

The evolution view looks at different versions in a project lifetime of a number of selected source files. The views share one code model, which combines hierarchical syntax based and line based information from multiple source files versions. We render this code model using a visual model that extends the pixel-filling, space partitioning properties of shaded cushion treemaps with novel techniques.

The motivation behind the distortion approach is for assisting users to rapidly browse information displayed in the TreeMap without opening successive layers of the hierarchy. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the new approach. In the first experiment (N=20) the distortion approach is compared to the drill down method. Results show that subjects are quicker and more accurate in locating targets of interest using the distortion method. The second experiment (N=12) evaluates the effectiveness of the two approaches in a task requiring context, we define as the context browsing task. The results show that subjects are quicker and more accurate in locating targets with the distortion technique in the context browsing task.","article_number":"1532132","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532132","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1532132/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1532132/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization, 2005.

Cognitive walkthrough (CW) is a well known usability inspection method that focuses on how easily users can learn software through exploration. Typical applications of CW follow structured tasks where user goals and action sequences that lead to achievement of the goals are well defined. KDViz and other information visualization tools, however, are typically designed for users to explore data and user goals and actions are less well understood. In this paper, we describe how the traditional CW method may be adapted for assessing the usability of these systems. We apply the adapted version of CW to CiteSpace, a KDViz tool that uses bibliometric analyses to create visualizations of scientific literatures. We describe usability issues identified by the adapted CW and discuss how CiteSpace supported the completion of tasks, such as identifying research fronts, and the achievement of goals. Finally, we discuss improvements to the adapted CW and issues to be addressed before applying it to a wider range of KDViz tools.","article_number":"1532147","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532147","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1532147/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1532147/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization, 2005.

These properties are best characterized as being invariant over affine but not Euclidean transformations. They are related, but not identical to, the non-accidental properties (NAPs) described by Lowe in \"perceptual organization and visual recognition\" (1984) on which the notion of geons is based in \"recognition by components - a theory of image understanding\" by I. Biederman (1987). A large number of possible 3D glyphs for the visualization of spatial data can be constructed using such properties. One group is based on the local sign of surface curvature.

We propose a distribution glyph, in both two- and three-dimensional forms, which specifically addresses the concept of how the aggregated data is distributed over the possible range of values. It is capable of displaying distribution, variability and extent information for up to four attributes at a time of multivariate, clustered data. User studies validate the concept, showing that both glyphs are just as good as raw data and the 3D glyph is better for answering some questions.","article_number":"1532140","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532140","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1532140/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1532140/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization, 2005.

Partitioning of spatial data is a complex process that depends on numerous factors such as population, costs incurred in deploying or utilizing resources and target capacity of a resource. Moreover, complex data such as population distributions are dynamic i.e. they may change over time. Simple animation may not effectively show temporal changes in spatial data. We propose the use of three temporal visualization techniques -wedges, rings and time slices - to display the nature of change in temporal data in a single view. Along with maximizing resource utilization and minimizing utilization costs, a partition should also ensure the long term effectiveness of the plan. We use multi-attribute visualization techniques to highlight the strengths and identify the weaknesses of a partition. Comparative visualization techniques allow multiple partitions to be viewed simultaneously. Users can make informed decisions about how to partition geo spatial data by using a combination of our techniques for multi-attribute visualization, temporal visualization and comparative visualization.","article_number":"1532149","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532149","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1532149/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1532149/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization, 2005.

To tailor to diverse user queries introduced during a conversation, we automate the generation of system responses, including both spoken and visual outputs. In this paper, we focus on the problem of visual context management, a process that dynamically updates an existing visual display to effectively incorporate new information requested by subsequent user queries. Specifically, we develop an optimization based approach to visual context management. Compared to existing approaches, which normally handle predictable visual context updates, our work offers two unique contributions. First, we provide a general computational framework that can effectively manage a visual context for diverse, unanticipated situations encountered in a user system conversation. Moreover, we optimize the satisfaction of both semantic and visual constraints, which otherwise are difficult to balance using simple heuristics. Second, we present an extensible representation model that uses feature based metrics to uniformly define all constraints. We have applied our work to two different applications and our evaluation has shown the promise of this work.","article_number":"1532146","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532146","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1532146/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1532146/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization, 2005.

In the last decades, archaeologists have found evidence of even older building structures buried in the soil, with doorways that also appear to have distinct orientations. This paper presents a novel diagram combining archaeological maps with a folded-apart, flattened view of the whole sky, showing the local horizon and the daily paths of Sun, Moon and brighter stars. By use of this diagram, interesting groupings of astronomical orientation directions, e.g. to certain Sunrise and Sunset points could be identified, which were evidently used to mark certain days of the year.

Our new rendering algorithms are based on the partitioning of screen space, which allows us to handle dense dataset regions correctly. The algorithms in previous work led to incorrect visual representations because of overculling, and to inefficiencies due to overdrawing multiple items in the same region. Our pixel based drawing infrastructure guarantees correctness by eliminating overculling, and improves rendering performance with tight bounds on overdrawing. PRITree and PRISeq are applications built on PRISAD, with the feature sets of TreeJuxtaposer and SequenceJuxtaposer, respectively. We describe our PRITree and PRISeq dataset traversal algorithms, which are used for efficient rendering, culling, and layout of datasets within the PRISAD framework. We also discuss PRITree node marking techniques, which offer order-of-magnitude improvements to both memory and time performance versus previous range storage and retrieval techniques. Our PRITree implementation features a five fold increase in rendering speed for nontrivial tree structures, and also reduces memory requirements in some real world datasets by up to eight times, so we are able to handle trees of several million nodes. PRISeq renders fifteen times faster and handles datasets twenty times larger than previous work.","article_number":"1532127","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532127","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1532127/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1532127/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization, 2005.
