This approach has gained popularity in recent years, and researchers have demonstrated prompts that achieve strong accuracy on specific NLP tasks. However, finding a prompt for new tasks requires experimentation. Different prompt templates with different wording choices lead to significant accuracy differences. PromptIDE allows users to experiment with prompt variations, visualize prompt performance, and iteratively optimize prompts. We developed a workflow that allows users to first focus on model feedback using small data before moving on to a large data regime that allows empirical grounding of promising prompts using quantitative measures of the task. The tool then allows easy deployment of the newly created ad-hoc models. We demonstrate the utility of PromptIDE (demo: http://prompt.vizhub.ai) and our workflow using several real-world use cases.","article_number":"9908590","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9908590","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9908590/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9908590/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"1146","end_page":"1156","citing_paper_count":20,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":3637,"insert_date":"20221003","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Task analysis","Visualization","Analytical models","Training","Natural language processing","Transformers","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Natural language processing","language modeling","zero-shot models"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Language Model","Large Language Models","Ad Hoc Task","Prompt Engineering","Specific Tasks","Natural Language Processing Tasks","Neural Language Models","Real-world Use Cases","Real World Use Cases","Business","Large Datasets","Large Data Sets","Rational Design","Design Principles","Natural Language","Confusion Matrix","Confusion Matrices","Domain Experts","Early Stopping","Early-stopping","Reading Comprehension","Entailment","Logical Consequence","Decision Logic","Logical Conclusion","Text Classification","Text Categorization","Document Classification","Correct Label","Answer Choices","Natural Language Processing Models","Large Test Set","CSV File","Piece Of Text","Visual Encoding","JSON File","Labeling Task","Pre-trained Language Models","Average Rank"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209448","title":"Dashboard Design Patterns","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":2,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Edinburgh, Scotland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085687578","id":37085687578,"full_name":"Benjamin Bach","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Edinburgh, Scotland"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Glasgow, Scotland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086962297","id":37086962297,"full_name":"Euan Freeman","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Glasgow, Scotland"]}},{"affiliation":"King's College London, England","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489317800","id":38489317800,"full_name":"Alfie Abdul-Rahman","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["King's College London, England"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Warwick, England","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37567685600","id":37567685600,"full_name":"Cagatay Turkay","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Warwick, England"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Oxford, England","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089207753","id":37089207753,"full_name":"Saiful Khan","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Oxford, England"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Oxford, England","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089642755","id":37089642755,"full_name":"Yulei Fan","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Oxford, England"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Oxford, England","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37280982800","id":37280982800,"full_name":"Min Chen","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Oxford, England"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"This paper introduces design patterns for dashboards to inform dashboard design processes. Despite a growing number of public examples, case studies, and general guidelines there is surprisingly little design guidance for dashboards. Such guidance is necessary to inspire designs and discuss tradeoffs in, e.g., screenspace, interaction, or information shown. Based on a systematic review of 144 dashboards, we report on eight groups of design patterns that provide common solutions in dashboard design. We discuss combinations of these patterns in “dashboard genres” such as narrative, analytical, or embedded dashboard. We ran a 2-week dashboard design workshop with 23 participants of varying expertise working on their own data and dashboards. We discuss the application of patterns for the dashboard design processes, as well as general design tradeoffs and common challenges. Our work complements previous surveys and aims to support dashboard designers and researchers in co-creation, structured design decisions, as well as future user evaluations about dashboard design guidelines.

the time-frequency distribution of radio signals and analyzing their time-varying patterns of communication states in radio monitoring and management. While it excels when performing short-term signal analyses, it becomes inadaptable for long-term signal analyses because it cannot adequately depict signal time-varying patterns in a large time span on a space-limited screen. This research thus presents an abstract signal time-frequency (ASTF) diagram to address this problem. In the diagram design, a visual abstraction method is proposed to visually encode signal communication state changes in time slices. A time segmentation algorithm is proposed to divide a large time span into time slices. Three new quantified metrics and a loss function are defined to ensure the preservation of important time-varying information in the time segmentation. An algorithm performance experiment and a user study are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the diagram for long-term signal analyses.","article_number":"9904890","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904890","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904890/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904890/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"214","end_page":"224","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":759,"insert_date":"20220928","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Time-frequency analysis","Signal analysis","Image color analysis","Data processing","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Radio signal","visual abstraction","time-oriented data","binary sequence"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Radio Waves","Time-varying Patterns","Visual Abstract","Loss Function","Time Span","Signal Analysis","User Study","Visual Methods","Statistical Patterns","Long-term Analysis","Time Segments","Time Slice","Large Span","Short-term Analysis","Visual Encoding","Time Cost","Exact Location","Data Space","Supplementary Materials For Details","Anomaly Detection","Bitstream","Visual Space","Rising Edge","Sliding Window","R1 Group","Duty Ratio","Candidate Locations","Short Communication","Signal Bandwidth","Signal State"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209435","title":"Extending the Nested Model for User-Centric XAI: A Design Study on GNN-based Drug Repurposing","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":4,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Harvard University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543277","id":37086543277,"full_name":"Qianwen Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Stanford University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089644074","id":37089644074,"full_name":"Kexin Huang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Stanford University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089644977","id":37089644977,"full_name":"Payal Chandak","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085593192","id":37085593192,"full_name":"Marinka Zitnik","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37972937500","id":37972937500,"full_name":"Nils Gehlenborg","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"CCBY - IEEE is not the copyright holder of this material.

While many techniques exist to generate explanations, it remains unclear how to select and visually present AI explanations based on the characteristics of domain users. This paper aims to understand this question through a multidisciplinary design study for a specific problem: explaining graph neural network (GNN) predictions to domain experts in drug repurposing, i.e., reuse of existing drugs for new diseases. Building on the nested design model of visualization, we incorporate XAI design considerations from a literature review and from our collaborators' feedback into the design process. Specifically, we discuss XAI-related design considerations for usable visual explanations at each design layer: target user, usage context, domain explanation, and XAI goal at the domain layer; format, granularity, and operation of explanations at the abstraction layer; encodings and interactions at the visualization layer; and XAI and rendering algorithm at the algorithm layer. We present how the extended nested model motivates and informs the design of DrugExplorer, an XAI tool for drug repurposing. Based on our domain characterization, DrugExplorer provides path-based explanations and presents them both as individual paths and meta-paths for two key XAI operations, why and what else. DrugExplorer offers a novel visualization design called MetaMatrix with a set of interactions to help domain users organize and compare explanation paths at different levels of granularity to generate domain-meaningful insights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the selected visual presentation and DrugExplorer as a whole via a usage scenario, a user study, and expert interviews. From these evaluations, we derive insightful observations and reflections that can inform the design of XAI visualizations for other scientific applications.","article_number":"9916585","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9916585","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9916585/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9916585/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"1266","end_page":"1276","citing_paper_count":14,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":3283,"insert_date":"20221012","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Artificial intelligence","Drugs","Visualization","Diseases","Guidelines","Data visualization","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual Explanation","XAI","Graph Neural Network","Visualization Design Model","Drug Repurposing"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Nested Models","Drug Repurposing","Drug Repositioning","Design Process","User Study","Design Considerations","Domain Experts","Visual Presentation","Visual Demonstration","Target Domain","Level Of Granularity","US Context","Graph Neural Networks","Expert Interviews","Target User","Visual Design","Usage Scenarios","Individual Paths","Abstraction Layer","Different Levels Of Granularity","Visual Explanation","Medical Students","Graph Neural Network Model","Visualization Tool","Post-hoc Method","Post-hoc Methods","Treatment Of Type 2 Diabetes","Treatment Of Type-2 Diabetes","Interactive Visualization","Human Experts","Local Explanations","Arachidonic Acid Pathway","Repaglinide","Mental Models"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209360","title":"In Defence of Visual Analytics Systems: Replies to Critics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":5,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086808853","id":37086808853,"full_name":"Aoyu Wu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086544875","id":37086544875,"full_name":"Dazhen Deng","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100335","id":37087100335,"full_name":"Furui Cheng","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","id":37407308300,"full_name":"Yingcai Wu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Software, Tsinghua University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406039100","id":37406039100,"full_name":"Shixia Liu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Software, Tsinghua University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The last decade has witnessed many visual analytics (VA) systems that make successful applications to wide-ranging domains like urban analytics and explainable AI.

Although dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional data is widely used in visual cluster analysis in conjunction with scatterplots, there are several limitations on effective visual cluster analysis. First, it is non-trivial for an embedding to present clear visual cluster separation when keeping neighborhood structures. Second, as cluster analysis is a subjective task, user steering is required. However, it is also non-trivial to enable interactions in dimensionality reduction. To tackle these problems, we introduce contrastive learning into dimensionality reduction for high-quality embedding. We then redefine the gradient of the loss function to the negative pairs to enhance the visual cluster separation of embedding results. Based on the contrastive learning scheme, we employ link-based interactions to steer embeddings. After that, we implement a prototype visual interface that integrates the proposed algorithms and a set of visualizations. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that CDR outperforms existing techniques in terms of preserving correct neighborhood structures and improving visual cluster separation. The ablation experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of gradient redefinition. The user study verifies that CDR outperforms t-SNE and UMAP in the task of cluster identification. We also showcase two use cases on real-world datasets to present the effectiveness of link-based interactions.","article_number":"9904480","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904480","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904480/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904480/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"734","end_page":"744","citing_paper_count":12,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1384,"insert_date":"20220927","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Dimensionality reduction","Task analysis","Data models","Space heating","Clustering algorithms","Prototypes"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Dimensionality reduction","visual cluster analysis","contrastive learning"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interaction Analysis","Dimensionality Reduction","Visual Analysis","Clustering Visualization","Interactive Visual Analysis","Visual Cluster Analysis","High-dimensional","High-dimensional Space","User Study","Real-world Datasets","Real-world Data Sets","Ablation Experiments","Self-supervised Learning","Contrastive Learning","Neighborhood Structure","Neighbourhood Structure","Neighboring Structures","Visual Interface","Similarity Measure","Similarity Metrics","K-nearest Neighbor","Class Labels","Butterfly","Precision And Recall","Clustering Results","Clustering Patterns","Latent Space","Embedding Space","Non-parametric Technique","Parallel Coordinates","Clusters Of Points","Well-separated Clusters","Latin Square","Silhouette Coefficient","Top Left Corner","Low-dimensional Space","Lower-dimensional Space","ReLU Activation Function"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209465","title":"SliceTeller: A Data Slice-Driven Approach for Machine Learning Model Validation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":7,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"UC Davis, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089612987","id":37089612987,"full_name":"Xiaoyu Zhang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UC Davis, USA","Bosch Research, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center, USA - Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085831490","id":37085831490,"full_name":"Jorge Piazentin Ono","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center, USA - Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center, USA - Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085818815","id":37085818815,"full_name":"Huan Song","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center, USA - Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center, USA - Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37075500200","id":37075500200,"full_name":"Liang Gou","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center, USA - Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"UC Davis, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275869400","id":37275869400,"full_name":"Kwan-Liu Ma","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UC Davis, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center, USA - Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086048784","id":37086048784,"full_name":"Liu Ren","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center, USA - Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Real-world machine learning applications need to be thoroughly evaluated to meet critical product requirements for model release, to ensure fairness for different groups or individuals, and to achieve a consistent performance in various scenarios. For example, in autonomous driving, an object classification model should achieve high detection rates under different conditions of weather, distance, etc. Similarly, in the financial setting, credit-scoring models must not discriminate against minority groups. These conditions or groups are called as “Data Slices”. In product MLOps cycles, product developers must identify such critical data slices and adapt models to mitigate data slice problems. Discovering where models fail, understanding why they fail, and mitigating these problems, are therefore essential tasks in the MLOps life-cycle. In this paper, we present SliceTeller, a novel tool that allows users to debug, compare and improve machine learning models driven by critical data slices. SliceTeller automatically discovers problematic slices in the data, helps the user understand why models fail. More importantly, we present an efficient algorithm, SliceBoosting, to estimate trade-offs when prioritizing the optimization over certain slices. Furthermore, our system empowers model developers to compare and analyze different model versions during model iterations, allowing them to choose the model version best suitable for their applications. We evaluate our system with three use cases, including two real-world use cases of product development, to demonstrate the power of SliceTeller in the debugging and improvement of product-quality ML models.","article_number":"9906903","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9906903","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9906903/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9906903/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"842","end_page":"852","citing_paper_count":12,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2038,"insert_date":"20220930","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data models","Analytical models","Computational modeling","Training","Optimization","Adaptation models","Predictive models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Model Validation","Data Slicing","Data Validation","Model Evaluation","Data-Centric AI","Human-in-the-loop"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Machine Learning","Machine-learning","Model Validation","Machine Learning Models","Ethnic Minority","Minority Groups","Racial Minorities","Real-world Applications","Autonomous Vehicles","Autonomous Driving","Iterative Model","Real-world Use Cases","Real World Use Cases","Model Performance","Training Data","Validation Data","Valid Data","Deep Neural Network","Optimal Model","Model Comparison","Joint Effect","Spurious Correlations","Real Effect","Real Events","Real Consequences","Exhaustive Search","Brute-force Search","Example Of Analysis","Importance Weights","Self-supervised Learning","Contrastive Learning","Shallow Model","Boosting Models","End Of The Video","End Of Each Video","Graying","Hair Greying","Hair Graying","Object Height","Fire Detection","Image-based Detection","Imaging-based Detection","Expert Working","Ultrasonic Sensors","Ultrasonic Detection","Constraint Satisfaction Problem","Constraint Solver"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209353","title":"The Quest for Omnioculars: Embedded Visualization for Augmenting Basketball Game Viewing Experiences","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":8,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"John A.

While numerous visual analytics systems have been developed for sports analysts to derive insights, few tools target fans to improve their understanding and engagement of sports data during live games. By presenting extra data in the actual game views, embedded visualization has the potential to enhance fans' game-viewing experience. However, little is known about how to design such kinds of visualizations embedded into live games. In this work, we present a user-centered design study of developing interactive embedded visualizations for basketball fans to improve their live game-watching experiences. We first conducted a formative study to characterize basketball fans' in-game analysis behaviors and tasks. Based on our findings, we propose a design framework to inform the design of embedded visualizations based on specific data-seeking contexts. Following the design framework, we present five novel embedded visualization designs targeting five representative contexts identified by the fans, including shooting, offense, defense, player evaluation, and team comparison. We then developed Omnioculars, an interactive basketball game-viewing prototype that features the proposed embedded visualizations for fans' in-game data analysis. We evaluated Omnioculars in a simulated basketball game with basketball fans. The study results suggest that our design supports personalized in-game data analysis and enhances game understanding and engagement.","article_number":"9903338","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9903338","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903338/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903338/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"962","end_page":"972","citing_paper_count":11,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":989,"insert_date":"20220926","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Games","Sports","Fans","Videos","Data analysis","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Sports Analytics","Embedded Visualization","Data Visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Basketball Game","Athletes","Visual System","Design Framework","Identification Framework","User-centered","Human-centered Design","User-centered Design","Exergames","Active Games","Player Performance","Visual Design","Simulation Games","Present Data","Video Games","Computer Games","User Study","Speech Recognition","Speech Understanding","Tracking Data","Domain Experts","Design Space","Defense Strategy","Live Streaming","Computer Vision Techniques","Game Performance","Game Context","Box Score","Offensive Strategy","Design Space Exploration","Game Events","Digital Radio","Digital Wireless","Dynamic Labeling","Digital Audio Broadcasting","Player Movement","Separate Screen","Defensive Players","Players In Defense","Context Switching"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209347","title":"HetVis: A Visual Analysis Approach for Identifying Data Heterogeneity in Horizontal Federated Learning","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":9,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"TMCC, CS, Nankai University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086258030","id":37086258030,"full_name":"Xumeng Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TMCC, CS, Nankai University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37291847800","id":37291847800,"full_name":"Wei Chen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","Laboratory of Art and Archaeology Image, Ministry of Education, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37531405500","id":37531405500,"full_name":"Jiazhi Xia","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089640358","id":37089640358,"full_name":"Zhen Wen","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641498","id":37089641498,"full_name":"Rongchen Zhu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Graz University of Technology, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282557600","id":37282557600,"full_name":"Tobias Schreck","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Graz University of Technology, Austria"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Horizontal federated learning (HFL) enables distributed clients to train a shared model and keep their data privacy. In training high-quality HFL models, the data heterogeneity among clients is one of the major concerns. However, due to the security issue and the complexity of deep learning models, it is challenging to investigate data heterogeneity across different clients. To address this issue, based on a requirement analysis we developed a visual analytics tool, HetVis, for participating clients to explore data heterogeneity. We identify data heterogeneity through comparing prediction behaviors of the global federated model and the stand-alone model trained with local data. Then, a context-aware clustering of the inconsistent records is done, to provide a summary of data heterogeneity. Combining with the proposed comparison techniques, we develop a novel set of visualizations to identify heterogeneity issues in HFL. We designed three case studies to introduce how HetVis can assist client analysts in understanding different types of heterogeneity issues. Expert reviews and a comparative study demonstrate the effectiveness of HetVis.","article_number":"9912364","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9912364","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9912364/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9912364/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"310","end_page":"319","citing_paper_count":11,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":984,"insert_date":"20221005","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data models","Analytical models","Distributed databases","Training","Federated learning","Data visualization","Convergence"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Federated learning","data heterogeneity","cluster analysis","visual analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Heterogeneous Data","Data Heterogeneity","Federated Learning","Visual Analytics Approach","Horizontal Federated Learning","Local Data","Expert Review","Issue Of Heterogeneity","Stand-alone Model","Neural Network","Statistical Results","Global Model","Long Short-term Memory","Long Short Term Memory","LSTM","Global Data","Convolutional Neural Network Model","Clustering Approach","Statistical Heterogeneity","Data Space","Convex Hull","Ground Truth Labels","Communication Rounds","Local Clients","Face Masks","Distance-based Approach","Fluctuations In Performance","Local Updates","Polyline","Significance Of Heterogeneity","Projection Views","Aggregation Algorithm"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209357","title":"Towards Natural Language-Based Visualization Authoring","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":10,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086545328","id":37086545328,"full_name":"Yun Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), China"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641266","id":37089641266,"full_name":"Zhitao Hou","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), China"]}},{"affiliation":"Tsinghua University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641322","id":37089641322,"full_name":"Leixian Shen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tsinghua University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Carnegie Mellon University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089640380","id":37089640380,"full_name":"Tongshuang Wu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Oxford University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089643061","id":37089643061,"full_name":"Jiaqi Wang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oxford University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101935","id":37087101935,"full_name":"He Huang","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), China"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073639100","id":37073639100,"full_name":"Haidong Zhang","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), China"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37963085000","id":37963085000,"full_name":"Dongmei Zhang","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"A key challenge to visualization authoring is the process of getting familiar with the complex user interfaces of authoring tools. Natural Language Interface (NLI) presents promising benefits due to its learnability and usability. However, supporting NLIs for authoring tools requires expertise in natural language processing, while existing NLIs are mostly designed for visual analytic workflow. In this paper, we propose an authoring-oriented NLI pipeline by introducing a structured representation of users' visualization editing intents, called editing actions, based on a formative study and an extensive survey on visualization construction tools. The editing actions are executable, and thus decouple natural language interpretation and visualization applications as an intermediate layer. We implement a deep learning-based NL interpreter to translate NL utterances into editing actions. The interpreter is reusable and extensible across authoring tools. The authoring tools only need to map the editing actions into tool-specific operations. To illustrate the usages of the NL interpreter, we implement an Excel chart editor and a proof-of-concept authoring tool, VisTalk. We conduct a user study with VisTalk to understand the usage patterns of NL-based authoring systems. Finally, we discuss observations on how users author charts with natural language, as well as implications for future research.","article_number":"9912366","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9912366","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9912366/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9912366/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"1222","end_page":"1232","citing_paper_count":11,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1174,"insert_date":"20221005","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Natural languages","Authoring systems","Pipelines","Task analysis","Metadata","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization authoring","Natural language interface","Natural language understanding"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Natural Language","User Study","Vision Applications","Visual Construction","Color Change","Colour Change","Field Data","Visual System","Deep Learning Models","Sequence Of Actions","Visualization Tool","Bar Charts","User Input","Conditional Random Field","Object Naming","Named Entity Recognition","Entity Extraction","Named-entity Recognition","Visual Design","Simple Sentences","Standard Chart","Visual Chart","Chart Types","Column Chart","Multimodal Interaction","Multimodal Interface","Edit Operations","Data Entry","Mean Length Of Utterance","Word Predictability","Autocomplete","Trend Line","Text Annotation","Pictograms","Pictographs"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209500","title":"Affective Learning Objectives for Communicative Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":11,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Michigan, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089208600","id":37089208600,"full_name":"Elsie Lee-Robbins","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Michigan, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Michigan, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37331417100","id":37331417100,"full_name":"Eytan Adar","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Michigan, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"When designing communicative visualizations, we often focus on goals that seek to convey patterns, relations, or comparisons (cognitive learning objectives). We pay less attention to affective intents–those that seek to influence or leverage the audience's opinions, attitudes, or values in some way. Affective objectives may range in outcomes from making the viewer care about the subject, strengthening a stance on an opinion, or leading them to take further action. Because such goals are often considered a violation of perceived ‘neutrality’ or are ‘political,’ designers may resist or be unable to describe these intents, let alone formalize them as learning objectives. While there are notable exceptions–such as advocacy visualizations or persuasive cartography–we find that visualization designers rarely acknowledge or formalize affective objectives. Through interviews with visualization designers, we expand on prior work on using learning objectives as a framework for describing and assessing communicative intent. Specifically, we extend and revise the framework to include a set of affective learning objectives. This structured taxonomy can help designers identify and declare their goals and compare and assess designs in a more principled way. Additionally, the taxonomy can enable external critique and analysis of visualizations.

To alleviate this problem, we propose D-BIAS, a visual interactive tool that embodies human-in-the-loop AI approach for auditing and mitigating social biases from tabular datasets. It uses a graphical causal model to represent causal relationships among different features in the dataset and as a medium to inject domain knowledge. A user can detect the presence of bias against a group, say females, or a subgroup, say black females, by identifying unfair causal relationships in the causal network and using an array of fairness metrics. Thereafter, the user can mitigate bias by refining the causal model and acting on the unfair causal edges. For each interaction, say weakening/deleting a biased causal edge, the system uses a novel method to simulate a new (debiased) dataset based on the current causal model while ensuring a minimal change from the original dataset. Users can visually assess the impact of their interactions on different fairness metrics, utility metrics, data distortion, and the underlying data distribution. Once satisfied, they can download the debiased dataset and use it for any downstream application for fairer predictions. We evaluate D-BIAS by conducting experiments on 3 datasets and also a formal user study. We found that D-BIAS helps reduce bias significantly compared to the baseline debiasing approach across different fairness metrics while incurring little data distortion and a small loss in utility. Moreover, our human-in-the-loop based approach significantly outperforms an automated approach on trust, interpretability and accountability.","article_number":"9903601","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9903601","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903601/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903601/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"473","end_page":"482","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":901,"insert_date":"20220926","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Measurement","Visualization","Mathematical models","Human in the loop","Distortion","Data models","Machine learning algorithms"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Algorithmic Fairness","Causality","Debiasing","Human-in-the-loop","Visual Analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Algorithmic Bias","Algorithmic Discrimination","Face Recognition Bias","Algorithmic Biases","Learning Algorithms","Machine Learning Algorithms","Cognitive Domains","Domain Knowledge","Social Bias","Social Biases","User Study","Visualization Tool","Dataset Characteristics","Dataset Features","Causal Model","Causal Network","Data Distortion","Black Females","Utility Loss","Marital Status","Structural Equation Modeling","Machine Learning Models","Working Class","Root Node","Parent Node","Beta Coefficients","Beta-coefficients","Directed Graph","Directed Edge","Sensitive Attributes","Sensitivity Properties","Causal Graph","Set Of Metrics","Target Node","Causal Path","Output Label","Original Distribution","Bayesian Information Criterion Score","Capital Gains","Drop-down Menu","Drop-down Menus"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209447","title":"MetaGlyph: Automatic Generation of Metaphoric Glyph-based Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":13,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088769622","id":37088769622,"full_name":"Lu Ying","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086245904","id":37086245904,"full_name":"Xinhuan Shu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086544875","id":37086544875,"full_name":"Dazhen Deng","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089642708","id":37089642708,"full_name":"Yuchen Yang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Art and Archaeology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543321","id":37086543321,"full_name":"Tan Tang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Art and Archaeology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computing, Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593898200","id":37593898200,"full_name":"Lingyun Yu","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computing, Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","id":37407308300,"full_name":"Yingcai Wu","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","Alibaba-Zhejiang University Joint Research Institute of Frontier Technologies, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Glyph-based visualization achieves an impressive graphic design when associated with comprehensive visual metaphors, which help audiences effectively grasp the conveyed information through revealing data semantics. However, creating such metaphoric glyph-based visualization (MGV) is not an easy task, as it requires not only a deep understanding of data but also professional design skills. This paper proposes MetaGlyph, an automatic system for generating MGVs from a spreadsheet. To develop MetaGlyph, we first conduct a qualitative analysis to understand the design of current MGVs from the perspectives of metaphor embodiment and glyph design. Based on the results, we introduce a novel framework for generating MGVs by metaphoric image selection and an MGV construction. Specifically, MetaGlyph automatically selects metaphors with corresponding images from online resources based on the input data semantics. We then integrate a Monte Carlo tree search algorithm that explores the design of an MGV by associating visual elements with data dimensions given the data importance, semantic relevance, and glyph non-overlap. The system also provides editing feedback that allows users to customize the MGVs according to their design preferences. We demonstrate the use of MetaGlyph through a set of examples, one usage scenario, and validate its effectiveness through a series of expert interviews.","article_number":"9906974","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9906974","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9906974/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9906974/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"331","end_page":"341","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":814,"insert_date":"20220930","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Semantics","Layout","Authoring systems","Task analysis","Shape"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Glyph-based visualization","metaphor","machine learning","automatic visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Automatic Generation","Glyph-based Visualization","Spreadsheet","Dimensional Data","Visual Elements","Expert Interviews","Series Of Interviews","Usage Scenarios","Visual Metaphors","Monte Carlo Tree Search","Monte-Carlo Tree Search","Present Data","Numerical Data","Numerous Data","Multivariate Data","Multivariate Statistics","Creative Process","Diatoms","Black Arrows","Pie Chart","Reward Function","Specific Order","Importance Scores","Radar Chart","Radar Graph","Space Mapping","Group Dimension","Prominent Element","Radial Structure","Professional Tool","Visual Design","Visual Encoding","Online Sources","Highest Reward"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209405","title":"Seeing What You Believe or Believing What You See?

Therefore, one bedrock principle of science is to minimize that bias by testing the predictions of one's belief against objective data. But interpreting visualized data is a complex perceptual and cognitive process. Through two crowdsourced experiments, we demonstrate that supposedly objective assessments of the strength of a correlational relationship can be influenced by how strongly a viewer believes in the existence of that relationship. Participants viewed scatterplots depicting a relationship between meaningful variable pairs (e.g., number of environmental regulations and air quality) and estimated their correlations. They also estimated the correlation of the same scatterplots labeled instead with generic ‘X’ and ‘Y’ axes. In a separate section, they also reported how strongly they believed there to be a correlation between the meaningful variable pairs. Participants estimated correlations more accurately when they viewed scatterplots labeled with generic axes compared to scatterplots labeled with meaningful variable pairs. Furthermore, when viewers believed that two variables should have a strong relationship, they overestimated correlations between those variables by an r-value of about 0.1. When they believed that the variables should be unrelated, they underestimated the correlations by an r-value of about 0.1. While data visualizations are typically thought to present objective truths to the viewer, these results suggest that existing personal beliefs can bias even objective statistical values people extract from data.","article_number":"9904491","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904491","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904491/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904491/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"493","end_page":"503","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":752,"insert_date":"20220927","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Correlation","Data visualization","Task analysis","Regulation","Estimation","Air quality","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data Visualization","Visual Analysis","Data Interpretation","Perception","Cognition","Beliefs","Motivated Perception"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Relative Strength","Relative Strengths","Air Quality","Environmental Regulation","Environmental Law","Pairs Of Variables","Air Environment","Belief In The Existence","Level Of Agreement","Number Of Trees","Participants In Experiment","Differences In Participants","Correlation Estimates","Violent Crime","Form Of Bias","Verbal Scale","Scale Expression","Effect Of Beliefs","People's Beliefs","Just Noticeable Difference","Just-noticeable-difference","Distractor Task","Significant Differences In Participants","Belief Updating","Experiment 1a","Experiment 1b","Strength Of Belief","Gun Ownership","Firearm Ownership","Correlation Scatter Plots","Correlation Scatterplots","Posterior Beliefs","Annual Rainfall","Strong Prior","Upper Range"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209457","title":"Multiple Forecast Visualizations (MFVs): Trade-offs in Trust and Performance in Multiple COVID-19 Forecast Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":15,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of California Merced, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085907327","id":37085907327,"full_name":"Lace Padilla","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California Merced, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"New York University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089642587","id":37089642587,"full_name":"Racquel Fygenson","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California Merced, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102380","id":37087102380,"full_name":"Spencer C.

However, no work has empirically tested how multiple forecast visualization choices impact trust and task-based performance. The three studies presented in this paper ($N=1299$) examine how visualization choices impact trust in COVID-19 mortality forecasts and how they influence performance in a trend prediction task. These studies focus on line charts populated with real-time COVID-19 data that varied the number and color encoding of the forecasts and the presence of best/worst-case forecasts. The studies reveal that trust in COVID-19 forecast visualizations initially increases with the number of forecasts and then plateaus after 6–9 forecasts. However, participants were most trusting of visualizations that showed less visual information, including a 95% confidence interval, single forecast, and grayscale encoded forecasts. Participants maintained high trust in intervals labeled with 50% and 25% and did not proportionally scale their trust to the indicated interval size. Despite the high trust, the 95% CI condition was the most likely to evoke predictions that did not correspond with the actual COVID-19 trend. Qualitative analysis of participants' strategies confirmed that many participants trusted both the simplistic visualizations and those with numerous forecasts. This work provides practical guides for how COVID-19 forecast visualizations influence trust, including recommendations for identifying the range where forecasts balance trade-offs between trust and task-based performance.","article_number":"9904455","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904455","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904455/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904455/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"12","end_page":"22","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2098,"insert_date":"20220927","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["COVID-19","Uncertainty","Data visualization","Predictive models","Pandemics","Visualization","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["COVID-19","multiple forecast visualizations","uncertainty visualization","line charts","time-series data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["COVID-19 Forecast","Confidence Interval","Task Performance","Grayscale","Greyscale","Gray Level","Visual Information","Risk Communication","COVID-19 Mortality","COVID-19 Mortality Rates","Interval Size","High Trust","Line Chart","Trend Prediction","Active COVID-19","Participants In Group","End Of The Experiment","Most Parsimonious","Parsimony Analysis","Parsimonious Trees","Most Parsimonious Trees","Parsimonious Model","Model Parsimony","Ecological Validity","Ecologically Valid","Design Choices","Correct Predictions","COVID-19 Deaths","COVID-19 Death","Deaths In The US","Death In The US","Definition Of Trust","Differences In Trust","Manipulation Check","Ensemble Forecasts","Omnibus Analysis","Forecasting Model","Preregistered","Line Graph"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209490","title":"Understanding how Designers Find and Use Data Visualization Examples","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":16,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Maryland, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089638384","id":37089638384,"full_name":"Hannah K.

Current tools offer considerable support for creating individual visualizations but provide limited support for discovering groups of visualizations that can be collectively useful for composing analytic dashboards. To address this problem, we present Medley, a mixed-initiative interface that assists in dashboard composition by recommending dashboard collections (i.e., a logically grouped set of views and filtering widgets) that map to specific analytical intents. Users can specify dashboard intents (namely, measure analysis, change analysis, category analysis, or distribution analysis) explicitly through an input panel in the interface or implicitly by selecting data attributes and views of interest. The system recommends collections based on these analytic intents, and views and widgets can be selected to compose a variety of dashboards. Medley also provides a lightweight direct manipulation interface to configure interactions between views in a dashboard. Based on a study with 13 participants performing both targeted and open-ended tasks, we discuss how Medley's recommendations guide dashboard composition and facilitate different user workflows. Observations from the study identify potential directions for future work, including combining manual view specification with dashboard recommendations and designing natural language interfaces for dashboard authoring.","article_number":"9911200","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9911200","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9911200/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9911200/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"1135","end_page":"1145","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1038,"insert_date":"20221004","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Task analysis","Data visualization","Visualization","Recommender systems","Correlation","Medical services","Market research"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Dashboards","intent","recommendations","direct manipulation","multi-view coordination"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Set Of Views","Interactive","Visual System","Interesting Properties","Objective Analysis","Bar Charts","Analysis Tasks","Examples Of Systems","Recommender Systems","Design Goals","Start Of Session","Start Of Each Session","Statistical Metrics","Quantitative Properties","Quantitative Dimensions","Quantitative Attributes","Visual Design","Geographical Dimension","Geographical Attributes","Categorical Attributes","Classification Properties","Attribute Classification","Change In Sales","Changes In Profitability","Prior Recommendations","Onboarding","User Study","Chart Types","Choropleth Maps","Mailing Lists","Usage Scenarios","Company Performance","Line Chart","Visualization Tool"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209498","title":"FoVolNet: Fast Volume Rendering using Foveated Deep Neural Networks","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":19,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of California at Davis, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089013553","id":37089013553,"full_name":"David Bauer","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California at Davis, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California at Davis, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088599212","id":37088599212,"full_name":"Qi Wu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California at Davis, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California at Davis, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275869400","id":37275869400,"full_name":"Kwan-Liu Ma","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California at Davis, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Volume data is found in many important scientific and engineering applications. Rendering this data for visualization at high quality and interactive rates for demanding applications such as virtual reality is still not easily achievable even using professional-grade hardware. We introduce FoVolNet—a method to significantly increase the performance of volume data visualization. We develop a cost-effective foveated rendering pipeline that sparsely samples a volume around a focal point and reconstructs the full-frame using a deep neural network. Foveated rendering is a technique that prioritizes rendering computations around the user's focal point. This approach leverages properties of the human visual system, thereby saving computational resources when rendering data in the periphery of the user's field of vision. Our reconstruction network combines direct and kernel prediction methods to produce fast, stable, and perceptually convincing output. With a slim design and the use of quantization, our method outperforms state-of-the-art neural reconstruction techniques in both end-to-end frame times and visual quality. We conduct extensive evaluations of the system's rendering performance, inference speed, and perceptual properties, and we provide comparisons to competing neural image reconstruction techniques. Our test results show that FoVolNet consistently achieves significant time saving over conventional rendering while preserving perceptual quality.","article_number":"9903564","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9903564","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903564/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903564/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"515","end_page":"525","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":922,"insert_date":"20220926","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Image reconstruction","Visualization","Data visualization","Kernel","Image quality","Deep learning"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Volume data","volume visualization","deep learning","foveated rendering","neural reconstruction"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Neural Network","Deep Neural Network","Volume Rendering","Volumetric Rendering","Volume-rendering","Data Visualization","Image Reconstruction","Iterative Reconstruction","Tomographic Reconstruction","Visual Quality","Network Reconstruction","Direct Prediction","Human Visual System","Inference Speed","Deep Learning","Training Dataset","Training Data Set","Image Quality","Denoising","Noise Reduction","Optical Flow","Temporal Stability","Sequence Of Frames","Fast Movements","Current Frame","Compression Rate","Noise Patterns","Sparse Imaging","Regeneration Buffer","Framebuffer","Frame Buffer","Display Memory","Naive Approach","Recurrent Connections","Noise Map","Screen Space","Decoder Block","Encoding Stage","Temporal Loss"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209460","title":"No Grammar to Rule Them All: A Survey of JSON-style DSLs for Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":20,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Chicago, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088599263","id":37088599263,"full_name":"Andrew M.

We identify tensions throughout these areas, such as between formal and colloquial specifications, among types of users, and within the composition of languages.

In contrast to alternate approaches for specifying animated visualizations, which prize a highly expressive design space, Animated Vega-Lite prioritizes unifying animation with the language's existing abstractions for static and interactive visualizations to enable authors to smoothly move between or combine these modalities. Thus, to compose animation with static visualizations, we represent time as an encoding channel. Time encodings map a data field to animation keyframes, providing a lightweight specification for animations without interaction. To compose animation and interaction, we also represent time as an event stream; Vega-Lite selections, which provide dynamic data queries, are now driven not only by input events but by timer ticks as well. We evaluate the expressiveness of our approach through a gallery of diverse examples that demonstrate coverage over taxonomies of both interaction and animation. We also critically reflect on the conceptual affordances and limitations of our contribution by interviewing five expert developers of existing animation grammars. These reflections highlight the key motivating role of in-the-wild examples, and identify three central tradeoffs: the language design process, the types of animated transitions supported, and how the systems model keyframes.","article_number":"9914804","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9914804","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9914804/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9914804/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"149","end_page":"159","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":533,"insert_date":"20221010","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Animation","Data visualization","Encoding","Grammar","Taxonomy","Switches","Facial animation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Information visualization","Animation","Interaction","Toolkits","Systems","Declarative Specification"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Grammar Of Graphics","Critical Thinking","Critical Analysis","Critical Reflection","Critical Appraisal","Design Process","Affordances","Interactive Visualization","Query Data","Event Stream","Input Events","Subset Of Data","Bird Species","Data Transformation","Top View","Mental Models","Transition Function","Annual Dataset","Dataset For The Year","Annual Data Set","Interaction Techniques","Different Levels Of Detail","Language Constructs","Key Fields","Visual Encoding","Bottom View"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209444","title":"ChartWalk: Navigating large collections of text notes in electronic health records for clinical chart review","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":22,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Toronto, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085760573","id":37085760573,"full_name":"Nicole Sultanum","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Toronto, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641418","id":37089641418,"full_name":"Farooq Naeem","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Toronto, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085722488","id":37085722488,"full_name":"Michael Brudno","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Toronto, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Toronto, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37395495900","id":37395495900,"full_name":"Fanny Chevalier","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Toronto, Canada"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Before seeing a patient for the first time, healthcare workers will typically conduct a comprehensive clinical chart review of the patient's electronic health record (EHR).

However, most work in DVL for children relies on a more formal educational context (i.e., a teacher-led approach) that limits children's engagement with data to classroom-based environments and, consequently, children's ability to ask questions about and explore data on topics they find personally meaningful. We explore how a curiosity-driven, child-led approach can provide more agency to children when they are authoring data visualizations. This paper explores how informal learning with crafting physicalizations through play and curiosity may foster increased literacy and engagement with data. Employing a constructionist approach, we designed a do-it-yourself toolkit made out of everyday materials (e.g., paper, cardboard, mirrors) that enables children to create, customize, and personalize three different interactive visualizations (bar, line, pie). We used the toolkit as a design probe in a series of in-person workshops with 5 children (6 to 11-year-olds) and interviews with 5 educators. Our observations reveal that the toolkit helped children creatively engage and interact with visualizations. Children with prior knowledge of data visualization reported the toolkit serving as more of an authoring tool that they envision using in their daily lives, while children with little to no experience found the toolkit as an engaging introduction to data visualization. Our study demonstrates the potential of using the constructionist approach to cultivate children's DVL through curiosity and play.","article_number":"9903547","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9903547","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903547/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903547/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"257","end_page":"267","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":814,"insert_date":"20220926","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Education","Bars","Prototypes","Cognition","Visualization","Pediatrics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization literacy","children","constructionism","informal learning"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Curiosity","Curious","Visual Literacy","Data Visualization","Series Of Workshops","Child Engagement","Children's Engagement","Physicalism","Everyday Material","Everyday Fabric","Prototype","3D Printing","Number Of Data Points","Bar Charts","Pie Chart","Sense Of Ownership","Design Goals","Interests Of The Child","Interest In Children","Visual Components","Smartphone Camera","Phone Camera","Fiducial Markers","After-school Programs","After-school Care","After-school Activities","Line Chart","Paper Strips","Informal Spaces","Smartphone","End Of The Workshop","End Of Each Workshop","University Of Colorado Boulder","CU Boulder","University Of Colorado At Boulder","Foster Children","Foster Child","Workshop Group","Creativity","Creative Thinking","Digital Representation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209390","title":"BeauVis: A Validated Scale for Measuring the Aesthetic Pleasure of Visual Representations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":24,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LISN, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641957","id":37089641957,"full_name":"Tingying He","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LISN, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LISN, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591317800","id":37591317800,"full_name":"Petra Isenberg","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LISN, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Technische Universität Dresden, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37313321900","id":37313321900,"full_name":"Raimund Dachselt","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technische Universität Dresden, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LISN, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37297057400","id":37297057400,"full_name":"Tobias Isenberg","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LISN, France"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We developed and validated a rating scale to assess the aesthetic pleasure (or beauty) of a visual data representation: the BeauVis scale.

Analyzing the movements of off-ball players can thus facilitate the development of effective strategies for coaches. However, common basketball statistics (e.g., points and assists) primarily focus on what happens around the ball and are mostly result-oriented, making it challenging to objectively assess and fully understand the contributions of off-ball movements. To address these challenges, we collaborate closely with domain experts and summarize the multi-level requirements for off-ball movement analysis in basketball. We first establish an assessment model to quantitatively evaluate the offensive contribution of an off-ball movement considering both the position of players and the team cooperation. Based on the model, we design and develop a visual analytics system called OBTracker to support the multifaceted analysis of off-ball movements. OBTracker enables users to identify the frequency and effectiveness of off-ball movement patterns and learn the performance of different off-ball players. A tailored visualization based on the Voronoi diagram is proposed to help users interpret the contribution of off-ball movements from a temporal perspective. We conduct two case studies based on the tracking data from NBA games and demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of OBTracker through expert feedback.","article_number":"9904482","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904482","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904482/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904482/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"929","end_page":"939","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":974,"insert_date":"20220927","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Sports","Games","Tracking","Visual analytics","Interviews","Data visualization","Data models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Sports visualization","basketball tracking data","off-ball movement analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Visual System","Movement Patterns","Tracking Data","Domain Experts","Movement Analysis","Voronoi Diagram","Voronoi Tessellation","Voronoi Cell","Player Performance","Basketball Players","Player Position","Ball Possession","Team Cooperation","Player Movement","Grid Cells","Team Sports","Teammates","Model Interpretation","Movement Speed","Smooth Curve","Pie Chart","Type Of Movement","Continuous Interaction","Continued Interaction","Game Situations","Game Context","Panel Selection","Basketball Game","Different Levels Of Detail","Number Of Movements","Strong Side","Movement Flow","Rows Of Cells"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209475","title":"Effects of View Layout on Situated Analytics for Multiple-View Representations in Immersive Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":27,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089640358","id":37089640358,"full_name":"Zhen Wen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101788","id":37087101788,"full_name":"Wei Zeng","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), China","The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089640733","id":37089640733,"full_name":"Luoxuan Weng","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089643111","id":37089643111,"full_name":"Yihan Liu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Zhengzhou University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396970400","id":37396970400,"full_name":"Mingliang Xu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhengzhou University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37291847800","id":37291847800,"full_name":"Wei Chen","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","Laboratory of Art and Archaeology Image, Ministry of Education, Zhejiang University, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Multiple-view (MV) representations enabling multi-perspective exploration of large and complex data are often employed on 2D displays. The technique also shows great potential in addressing complex analytic tasks in immersive visualization. However, although useful, the design space of MV representations in immersive visualization lacks in deep exploration. In this paper, we propose a new perspective to this line of research, by examining the effects of view layout for MV representations on situated analytics. Specifically, we disentangle situated analytics in perspectives of situatedness regarding spatial relationship between visual representations and physical referents, and analytics regarding cross-view data analysis including filtering, refocusing, and connecting tasks. Through an in-depth analysis of existing layout paradigms, we summarize design trade-offs for achieving high situatedness and effective analytics simultaneously. We then distill a list of design requirements for a desired layout that balances situatedness and analytics, and develop a prototype system with an automatic layout adaptation method to fulfill the requirements. The method mainly includes a cylindrical paradigm for egocentric reference frame, and a force-directed method for proper view-view, view-user, and view-referent proximities and high view visibility. We conducted a formal user study that compares layouts by our method with linked and embedded layouts. Quantitative results show that participants finished filtering- and connecting-centered tasks significantly faster with our layouts, and user feedback confirms high usability of the prototype system.","article_number":"9904883","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904883","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904883/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904883/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"440","end_page":"450","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1320,"insert_date":"20220928","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Layout","Data visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Visualization","Task analysis","Data analysis","Prototypes"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Situated analytics","multiple-view representations","view layout","immersive visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Immersive Visualization","View Layout","Reference Frame","Visual Representation","User Study","Exploratory Data","Design Space","User Feedback","Prototype System","List Of Requirements","Complex Analytic","Complex Analytes","Egocentric Reference Frame","Body Movements","Physical Space","3D Space","3-dimensional Space","Design Considerations","Vertical Position","Vertical Location","Physical World","3D Visualization","3D Environment","Automatic Alignment","Layout Design","Cylindrical Surface","Elliptical Cylinder","Visual Design","Perspective Distortion","Automatic Approach","Board Games","Head-mounted Display","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Lack Of Exploration"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209382","title":"Incorporation of Human Knowledge into Data Embeddings to Improve Pattern Significance and Interpretability","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":28,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085431300","id":37085431300,"full_name":"Jie Li","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089642579","id":37089642579,"full_name":"Chun-qi Zhou","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Embedding is a common technique for analyzing multi-dimensional data.

The approach pulls samples of the same class with similar data features closer in the projection, leading to more compact (significant) and class-consistent (interpretable) visual structures. We give an embedding network with a customized classification loss to implement the idea and integrate the network into a visualization system to form a workflow that supports flexible class creation and pattern exploration.

Collaborating with domain experts, we design a visual analytics system, AttnAnalyzer, that enables users to explore how DL models make predictions by allowing effective spatio-temporal dependency analysis. The system incorporates dynamic time warping (DTW) and Granger causality tests for computational spatio-temporal dependency analysis while providing map, table, line chart, and pixel views to assist user to perform dependency and model behavior analysis. For the evaluation, we present three case studies showing how AttnAnalyzer can effectively explore model behaviors and improve model performance in two different road networks.

This paper is the first to provide a structured approach to mapping possible actions with the paper to interaction commands. This design space and the findings of a controlled user study have implications for future designs of augmented reality systems involving paper sheets and visualizations. Through workshops ($\\mathrm{N}=20$) and ideation, we identified 81 interactions that we classify in three dimensions: 1) commands that can be supported by an interaction, 2) the specific parameters provided by an (inter)action with paper, and 3) the number of paper sheets involved in an interaction. We tested user preference and viability of 11 of these interactions with a prototype implementation in a controlled study ($\\mathrm{N}=12$, HoloLens 2) and found that most of the interactions are intuitive and engaging to use. We summarized interactions (e.g., tilt to pan) that have strong affordance to complement “point” for data exploration, physical limitations and properties of paper as a medium, cases requiring redundancy and shortcuts, and other implications for design.","article_number":"9904446","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904446","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904446/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904446/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"27 Jan. 2023","start_page":"418","end_page":"428","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1055,"insert_date":"20220927","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Task analysis","Augmented reality","Affordances","Three-dimensional displays","Navigation","Human computer interaction"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Interaction design","augmented reality","paper interaction","tangible user interface","printed data visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Visualization","User Study","Exploratory Data","Design Space","Sheet Of Paper","Interaction Techniques","Properties Of Paper","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Freedom Of Expression","Free Expression","Public Expression","Bar Charts","Piece Of Paper","Meaningful Interactions","Pie Chart","3D Visualization","Interactive Visualization","Brainstorming","Head-mounted Display","Visual Markers","Hand Gestures","Degree Of Information","Line Chart","Multiple Papers","Multiple Documents","Interaction Design","Hand Tracking","Finger Tracking","Paper Cards","Mixed Reality","Metaphor","High-level Tasks","Higher-level Tasks","Visual Fatigue","Eye Fatigue","Asthenopia","Eye Strain"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209425","title":"DendroMap: Visual Exploration of Large-Scale Image Datasets for Machine Learning with Treemaps","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":31,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Oregon State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641345","id":37089641345,"full_name":"Donald Bertucci","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oregon State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Oregon State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089642225","id":37089642225,"full_name":"Md Montaser Hamid","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oregon State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Oregon State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641126","id":37089641126,"full_name":"Yashwanthi Anand","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oregon State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Oregon State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089174035","id":37089174035,"full_name":"Anita Ruangrotsakun","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oregon State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Oregon State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089169178","id":37089169178,"full_name":"Delyar Tabatabai","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oregon State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Oregon State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641831","id":37089641831,"full_name":"Melissa Perez","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oregon State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Oregon State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085451248","id":37085451248,"full_name":"Minsuk Kahng","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oregon State University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this paper, we present DendroMap, a novel approach to interactively exploring large-scale image datasets for machine learning (ML).

However, neither approach effectively scales to large datasets because images are ineffectively organized and interactions are insufficiently supported. To address these challenges, we develop DendroMap by adapting Treemaps, a well-known visualization technique. DendroMap effectively organizes images by extracting hierarchical cluster structures from high-dimensional representations of images. It enables users to make sense of the overall distributions of datasets and interactively zoom into specific areas of interests at multiple levels of abstraction. Our case studies with widely-used image datasets for deep learning demonstrate that users can discover insights about datasets and trained models by examining the diversity of images, identifying underperforming subgroups, and analyzing classification errors.

The efficacy of different promotion strategies can help sellers adapt their offering to customer demand in order to survive and thrive. Current approaches to designing promotion strategies are either based on econometrics, which may not scale to large amounts of sales data, or are spontaneous and provide little explanation of sales volume. Moreover, accurately measuring the effects of promotion designs and making bootstrappable adjustments accordingly remains a challenge due to the incompleteness and complexity of the information describing promotion strategies and their market environments. We present PromotionLens, a visual analytics system for exploring, comparing, and modeling the impact of various promotion strategies. Our approach combines representative multivariant time-series forecasting models and well-designed visualizations to demonstrate and explain the impact of sales and promotional factors, and to support “what-if” analysis of promotions. Two case studies, expert feedback, and a qualitative user study demonstrate the efficacy of PromotionLens.","article_number":"9903289","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9903289","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903289/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903289/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"767","end_page":"777","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":897,"insert_date":"20220926","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Electronic commerce","Time series analysis","Predictive models","Data visualization","Analytical models","Visual analytics","Correlation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["E-commerce","promotion strategy","time-series prediction","“what-if” analysis","visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Promotion Strategies","Online E-commerce","Time Series","Time-series","Visual System","User Study","Forecasting Model","Time Series Prediction","Time-series Prediction","Time-series Forecasting","Time Series Forecasting","Sales Volume","Sales Data","Representative Time Series","Prediction Model","Convolutional Neural Network","Machine Learning Models","Time Series Data","Time-series Data","Product Categories","Domain Experts","Time Series Models","Time-series Regression","Time-series Models","Time Series Regression","Online Shopping","Online Store","Online Retailer","Mean Absolute Percentage Error","MAPE","End Of Month","End Of Each Month","Price Elasticity","Performance Of Different Models","Enterprise Resource Planning","ERP System","Beginning Of Each Month","Beginning Of The Month","Visual Design","Shapley Value","SHAP Values","Product Name","Sneakers","Running Shoes","Trainers","TraB","Promotion Policies","Machine Learning Models For Prediction"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209483","title":"CohortVA: A Visual Analytic System for Interactive Exploration of Cohorts based on Historical Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":33,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089642680","id":37089642680,"full_name":"Wei Zhang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641965","id":37089641965,"full_name":"Jason K.

However, these studies mainly focused on visualizations with a single view to a small number of views, and there are still unresolved questions about how to design responsive multi-view visualizations. In this paper, we present a reusable and generalizable framework for designing responsive multi-view visualizations focused on genomics data. To gain a better understanding of existing design challenges, we review web-based genomics visualization tools in the wild. By characterizing tools based on a taxonomy of responsive designs, we find that responsiveness is rarely supported in existing tools. To distill insights from the survey results in a systematic way, we classify typical view composition patterns, such as “vertically long,” “horizontally wide,” “circular,” and “cross-shaped” compositions. We then identify their usability issues in different resolutions that stem from the composition patterns, as well as discussing approaches to address the issues and to make genomics visualizations responsive. By extending the Gosling visualization grammar to support responsive constructs, we show how these approaches can be supported. A valuable follow-up study would be taking different input modalities into account, such as mouse and touch interactions, which was not considered in our study.","article_number":"9904451","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904451","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904451/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904451/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"559","end_page":"569","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1408,"insert_date":"20220927","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Genomics","Bioinformatics","Usability","Grammar","Design methodology","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Responsive visualization","multi-view visualization","genomics","visualization grammar"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Genomic Data","Design Patterns","Multi-view Design","Survey Results","Composition Patterns","Input Modalities","Usability Issues","Series Of Recent Studies","Web-based Visualization","Scalable","Visual Representation","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Bar Charts","Design Space","Single Tracking","Small Screen","Visual Design","Line Chart","Comparison Task","Multiple Tracking","Number Of Tracks","Type Of Visualization","Majority Of Tools","Majority Of These Tools","Track Types","Categories Of Tools","High-level Categories","Higher-level Categories","Multiple Genomic Loci","Circular Layout","Screen Space"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209451","title":"Data Hunches: Incorporating Personal Knowledge into Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":35,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Utah, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089649929","id":37089649929,"full_name":"Haihan Lin","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Utah, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Utah, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089649641","id":37089649641,"full_name":"Derya Akbaba","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Utah, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Linköping University, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564728700","id":37564728700,"full_name":"Miriah Meyer","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Linköping University, Sweden"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Utah, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37395933400","id":37395933400,"full_name":"Alexander Lex","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Utah, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The trouble with data is that it frequently provides only an imperfect representation of a phenomenon of interest.

However, personal knowledge about the caveats of a dataset is typically not incorporated in a structured way, which is problematic if others who lack that knowledge interpret the data. In this work, we define such analysts' knowledge about datasets as data hunches. We differentiate data hunches from uncertainty and discuss types of hunches. We then explore ways of recording data hunches, and, based on a prototypical design, develop recommendations for designing visualizations that support data hunches. We conclude by discussing various challenges associated with data hunches, including the potential for harm and challenges for trust and privacy. We envision that data hunches will empower analysts to externalize their knowledge, facilitate collaboration and communication, and support the ability to learn from others' data hunches.","article_number":"9903288","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9903288","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903288/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903288/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"504","end_page":"514","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":662,"insert_date":"20220926","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty","Data visualization","Visualization","Recording","Data analysis","Data models","Blood"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data Visualization","Uncertainty","Data Hunches"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209474","title":"A Comparison of Spatiotemporal Visualizations for 3D Urban Analytics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":36,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Calgary, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085638005","id":37085638005,"full_name":"Roberta Mota","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Brazil","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38018628600","id":38018628600,"full_name":"Nivan Ferreira","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Brazil"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085898404","id":37085898404,"full_name":"Julio Daniel Silva","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Illinois at Chicago, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089642033","id":37089642033,"full_name":"Marius Horga","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Illinois at Chicago, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Universidade Federal Fluminense, Brazil","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37721747800","id":37721747800,"full_name":"Marcos Lage","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universidade Federal Fluminense, Brazil"]}},{"affiliation":"New York University, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641937","id":37089641937,"full_name":"Luis Ceferino","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085906267","id":37085906267,"full_name":"Usman Alim","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300925900","id":37300925900,"full_name":"Ehud Sharlin","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Illinois at Chicago, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085886059","id":37085886059,"full_name":"Fabio Miranda","author_order":9,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Illinois at Chicago, United States"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Recent technological innovations have led to an increase in the availability of 3D urban data, such as shadow, noise, solar potential, and earthquake simulations. These spatiotemporal datasets create opportunities for new visualizations to engage experts from different domains to study the dynamic behavior of urban spaces in this under explored dimension. However, designing 3D spatiotemporal urban visualizations is challenging, as it requires visual strategies to support analysis of time-varying data referent to the city geometry. Although different visual strategies have been used in 3D urban visual analytics, the question of how effective these visual designs are at supporting spatiotemporal analysis on building surfaces remains open. To investigate this, in this paper we first contribute a series of analytical tasks elicited after interviews with practitioners from three urban domains. We also contribute a quantitative user study comparing the effectiveness of four representative visual designs used to visualize 3D spatiotemporal urban data: spatial juxtaposition, temporal juxtaposition, linked view, and embedded view. Participants performed a series of tasks that required them to identify extreme values on building surfaces over time. Tasks varied in granularity for both space and time dimensions. Our results demonstrate that participants were more accurate using plot-based visualizations (linked view, embedded view) but faster using color-coded visualizations (spatial juxtaposition, temporal juxtaposition). Our results also show that, with increasing task complexity, plot-based visualizations perform better in preserving efficiency (time, accuracy) compared to color-coded visualizations. Based on our findings, we present a set of takeaways with design recommendations for 3D spatiotemporal urban visualizations for researchers and practitioners. Lastly, we report on a series of interviews with four practitioners, and their feedback and suggestions for further work on the visualizations to support 3D spatiotemporal urban data analysis.","article_number":"9904453","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904453","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904453/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904453/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"1277","end_page":"1287","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":540,"insert_date":"20220927","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Urban areas","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Task analysis","Buildings","Spatial databases"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","urban analytics","urban data","spatiotemporal data","empirical evaluation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209458","title":"Visual Comparison of Language Model Adaptation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":37,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086240969","id":37086240969,"full_name":"Rita Sevastjanova","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087002703","id":37087002703,"full_name":"Eren Cakmak","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Bar-Ilan University, Israel","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089642944","id":37089642944,"full_name":"Shauli Ravfogel","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Bar-Ilan University, Israel"]}},{"affiliation":"ETH, Israel","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089642995","id":37089642995,"full_name":"Ryan Cotterell","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["ETH, Israel"]}},{"affiliation":"ETH, AI Center, Israel","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086235941","id":37086235941,"full_name":"Mennatallah El-Assady","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["ETH, AI Center, Israel"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Neural language models are widely used; however, their model parameters often need to be adapted to the specific domains and tasks of an application, which is time- and resource-consuming. Thus, adapters have recently been introduced as a lightweight alternative for model adaptation. They consist of a small set of task-specific parameters with a reduced training time and simple parameter composition. The simplicity of adapter training and composition comes along with new challenges, such as maintaining an overview of adapter properties and effectively comparing their produced embedding spaces. To help developers overcome these challenges, we provide a twofold contribution. First, in close collaboration with NLP researchers, we conducted a requirement analysis for an approach supporting adapter evaluation and detected, among others, the need for both intrinsic (i.e., embedding similarity-based) and extrinsic (i.e., prediction-based) explanation methods. Second, motivated by the gathered requirements, we designed a flexible visual analytics workspace that enables the comparison of adapter properties. In this paper, we discuss several design iterations and alternatives for interactive, comparative visual explanation methods. Our comparative visualizations show the differences in the adapted embedding vectors and prediction outcomes for diverse human-interpretable concepts (e.g., person names, human qualities). We evaluate our workspace through case studies and show that, for instance, an adapter trained on the language debiasing task according to context-0 (decontextualized) embeddings introduces a new type of bias where words (even gender-independent words such as countries) become more similar to female- than male pronouns. We demonstrate that these are artifacts of context-0 embeddings, and the adapter effectively eliminates the gender information from the contextualized word representations.","article_number":"9904461","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904461","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904461/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904461/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"1178","end_page":"1188","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":592,"insert_date":"20220927","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Adaptation models","Task analysis","Analytical models","Training","Visual analytics","Data models","Transformers"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Language Model Adaptation","Adapter","Word Embeddings","Sequence Classification","Visual Analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Comparison","Language Model","Visual Analysis","Workspace","Latent Space","Embedding Space","Alternative Designs","Alternative Names","Exploratory Methods","Exploratory Method","Type Of Bias","Types Of Biases","Embedding Vectors","Concept Of Diversity","Personal Names","Visual Explanation","Design Process","Model Comparison","Representation Of Space","Analysis Tasks","Word List","Word Embedding","Word Vectors","Source Model","Target Model","Comparison Task","Similar Words","Named Entity Recognition","Entity Extraction","Named-entity Recognition","Natural Language Processing Tasks","Masked Language Model","Sentiment Analysis","Sentiment Classification","Country Names","Similar Embeddings","2D Space","Fine-tuned Model"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209493","title":"Visualization Design Practices in a Crisis: Behind the Scenes with COVID-19 Dashboard Creators","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":38,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"The Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086544588","id":37086544588,"full_name":"Yixuan Zhang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"The College of William & Mary, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085791934","id":37085791934,"full_name":"Yifan Sun","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The College of William & Mary, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"The Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089642195","id":37089642195,"full_name":"Joseph D.

Data dashboards, a form of information dissemination used during the pandemic, have facilitated this process by visualizing statistics regarding the number of COVID-19 cases over time. Prior work on COVID-19 visualizations has primarily focused on the design and evaluation of specific visualization systems from technology-centered perspectives. However, little is known about what occurs behind the scenes during the visualization creation processes, given the complex sociotechnical contexts in which they are embedded. Yet, such ecological knowledge is necessary to help characterize the nuances and trajectories of visualization design practices in the wild, as well as generate insights into how creators come to understand and approach visualization design on their own terms and for their own situated purposes. In this research, we conducted a qualitative interview study among dashboard creators from federal agencies, state health departments, mainstream news media outlets, and other organizations that created (often widely-used) COVID-19 dashboards to answer the following questions: how did visualization creators engage in COVID-19 dashboard design, and what tensions, conflicts, and challenges arose during this process? Our findings detail the trajectory of design practices—from creation to expansion, maintenance, and termination—that are shaped by the complex interplay between design goals, tools and technologies, labor, emerging crisis contexts, and public engagement. We particularly examined the tensions between designers and the general public involved in these processes. These conflicts, which often materialized due to a divergence between public demands and standing policies, centered around the type and amount of information to be visualized, how public perceptions shape and are shaped by visualization design, and the strategies utilized to deal with (potential) misinterpretations and misuse of visualizations. Our findings and lessons learned shed light on new ways of thinking in visualization design, focusing on the bundled activities that are invariably involved in human and nonhuman participation throughout the entire trajectory of design practice.","article_number":"9904866","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904866","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904866/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904866/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"1037","end_page":"1047","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":892,"insert_date":"20220928","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","COVID-19","Visualization","Pandemics","Trajectory","Production","Interviews"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Design practices","data visualization","COVID-19","qualitative research","general public","public health","crisis","dashboard"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Practical Design","Visual Design","COVID-19 Dashboard","Public Opinion","Public Perception","Data Visualization","Shed Light","Mainstream Media","Public Engagement","Design Goals","Public Demand","Geographic Information System","Visualization Tool","Times Of Crisis","Production Practices","Pandemic Situation","Performance Issues","Operational Issues","Design Decisions","Expansion Phase","Granular Data","Coarse Data","Terminal Phase","Boundary Objects","COVID-19 Data","Negotiation Outcomes","Result Of Negotiations","Crisis Communication","Misuse Of Data","Information Infrastructure","Public Health Knowledge","Reactions Of People","Design Team","Potential Future Changes"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209456","title":"Comparison Conundrum and the Chamber of Visualizations: An Exploration of How Language Influences Visual Design","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":39,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"UMass Amherst, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089636477","id":37089636477,"full_name":"Aimen Gaba","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UMass Amherst, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Tableau Research, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37392286200","id":37392286200,"full_name":"Vidya Setlur","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tableau Research, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Tableau Research, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086239144","id":37086239144,"full_name":"Arjun Srinivasan","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tableau Research, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Adobe Research, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085728980","id":37085728980,"full_name":"Jane Hoffswell","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Adobe Research, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"UMass Amherst, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102197","id":37087102197,"full_name":"Cindy Xiong","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UMass Amherst, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The language for expressing comparisons is often complex and nuanced, making supporting natural language-based visual comparison a non-trivial task. To better understand how people reason about comparisons in natural language, we explore a design space of utterances for comparing data entities. We identified different parameters of comparison utterances that indicate what is being compared (i.e., data variables and attributes) as well as how these parameters are specified (i.e., explicitly or implicitly). We conducted a user study with sixteen data visualization experts and non-experts to investigate how they designed visualizations for comparisons in our design space. Based on the rich set of visualization techniques observed, we extracted key design features from the visualizations and synthesized them into a subset of sixteen representative visualization designs. We then conducted a follow-up study to validate user preferences for the sixteen representative visualizations corresponding to utterances in our design space. Findings from these studies suggest guidelines and future directions for designing natural language interfaces and recommendation tools to better support natural language comparisons in visual analytics.","article_number":"9903602","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9903602","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903602/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903602/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"1211","end_page":"1221","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":408,"insert_date":"20220926","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Task analysis","Natural languages","Bars","Semantics","Computational linguistics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Comparative constructions","cardinality","explicit and implicit comparisons","natural language","intent","visual analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Design","Data Visualization","Natural Language","Utterances","Visual Analysis","Visual Comparison","Design Space","User Preferences","Athletes","Cardinality","Set Size","Differences In Preferences","Differences In Orientation","Bar Charts","Recommender Systems","Participant Preference","Participants Preferred","Horizontal Orientation","Line Chart","Comparison Task","Explicit Data","Explicit Values","Box Office","Implicit Values","Concrete Level","Computational Linguistics","Preference Ranking","Small Bars","Vague Concept","Significant Difference In Preference","Significant Differences In Orientation","Chart Types","Series Of Interviews","Dot Plots"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209443","title":"Unifying Effects of Direct and Relational Associations for Visual Communication","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":40,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Psychology and Wisconsin Institute for Discovery, University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641297","id":37089641297,"full_name":"Melissa A.

Traditionally, studies on these expectations (inferred mappings) distinguished distinct factors relevant for visualizations of categorical vs. continuous information. Studies on categorical information focused on direct associations (e.g., mangos are associated with yellows) whereas studies on continuous information focused on relational associations (e.g., darker colors map to larger quantities; dark-is-more bias). We unite these two areas within a single framework of assignment inference. Assignment inference is the process by which people infer mappings between perceptual features and concepts represented in encoding systems. Observers infer globally optimal assignments by maximizing the “merit,” or “goodness,” of each possible assignment. Previous work on assignment inference focused on visualizations of categorical information. We extend this approach to visualizations of continuous data by (a) broadening the notion of merit to include relational associations and (b) developing a method for combining multiple (sometimes conflicting) sources of merit to predict people's inferred mappings. We developed and tested our model on data from experiments in which participants interpreted colormap data visualizations, representing fictitious data about environmental concepts (sunshine, shade, wild fire, ocean water, glacial ice). We found both direct and relational associations contribute independently to inferred mappings. These results can be used to optimize visualization design to facilitate visual communication.","article_number":"9905997","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9905997","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9905997/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9905997/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"385","end_page":"395","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":372,"insert_date":"20220929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image color analysis","Data visualization","Semantics","Encoding","Visualization","Color","Observers"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual reasoning","information visualization","colormap data visualizations","visual encoding","color cognition"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Effect Of Association","Effect Of Affiliation","Visual Communication","Seawater","Glacial","Glacier","Data Visualization","Wildfire","Forest Fires","Bushfire","Color Map","Colour Map","Colormap","Category Information","Optimal Assignment","Left Side","Pairing","Strength Of Association","Relative Weight","Visual Features","Visual Characteristics","Light Color","Light Colour","Structural Conservation","Preservation Of Structure","Optimal Weight","Target Sample Size","Dark Side","Set Of Concepts","Conceptual Domains","Great Merit","Semantic Distance","Intermediate Color","Intermediate Colour","Expectancy Of People","Dark Background","Assignment Problem","Black Edges","Background Light","Color Vision","Colour Vision","Color Perception"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209378","title":"Visinity: Visual Spatial Neighborhood Analysis for Multiplexed Tissue Imaging Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":41,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Harvard John A.

These methods are increasingly being applied to understand how cancer cells and immune response change during tumor development, progression, and metastasis, as well as following treatment. Yet, existing analysis approaches focus on investigating small tissue samples on a per-cell basis, not taking into account the spatial proximity of cells, which indicates cell-cell interaction and specific biological processes in the larger cancer microenvironment. We present Visinity, a scalable visual analytics system to analyze cell interaction patterns across cohorts of whole-slide multiplexed tissue images. Our approach is based on a fast regional neighborhood computation, leveraging unsupervised learning to quantify, compare, and group cells by their surrounding cellular neighborhood. These neighborhoods can be visually analyzed in an exploratory and confirmatory workflow. Users can explore spatial patterns present across tissues through a scalable image viewer and coordinated views highlighting the neighborhood composition and spatial arrangements of cells. To verify or refine existing hypotheses, users can query for specific patterns to determine their presence and statistical significance. Findings can be interactively annotated, ranked, and compared in the form of small multiples. In two case studies with biomedical experts, we demonstrate that Visinity can identify common biological processes within a human tonsil and uncover novel white-blood cell networks and immune-tumor interactions.","article_number":"9904770","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904770","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904770/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904770/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"106","end_page":"116","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1178,"insert_date":"20220928","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Cancer","Biological tissues","Immune system","Tumors","Task analysis","Multiplexing","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","spatial analysis","tissue imaging"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Imaging Data","Visual Analysis","Tissue Imaging","Visual-spatial","Visual-spatial Abilities","Visual Spatial","Spatial Neighborhood","Spatial Neighbors","Spatial Neighbourhood","Spatial Neighbours","Multiplexed Tissue Imaging","Tissue Imaging Data","Tissue-Image Data","Visual Spatial Analysis","Visual-spatial Analysis","Spatial Patterns","Spatiotemporal Patterns","Temporal Patterns","Cell Interactions","Visual System","Interaction Patterns","Cell-cell Interactions","Place Cells","Place Field","Arrangement Of Cells","Spatial Proximity","Neighborhood Composition","Composition Of Neighbourhoods","Composition Of Neighborhoods","Neighbourhood Composition","Cell Types","Cell-type","T Cells","B Cells","Similar Neighbors","Similar Neighbourhoods","Neighborhood Similarity","Neighbor Vector","Neighborhood Vector","Neighbour Vector","Digital Pathology","Whole Slide Images","Whole-slide Images","Single Specimen","Holotype Specimen","Visual Encoding","Pairwise Interactions","CD8 T Cells","Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes","Cytotoxic T Cells","Composite View","Spatial Context"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209383","title":"Striking a Balance: Reader Takeaways and Preferences when Integrating Text and Charts","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":42,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"UC Berkeley, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089640501","id":37089640501,"full_name":"Chase Stokes","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UC Berkeley, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Tableau Research, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37392286200","id":37392286200,"full_name":"Vidya Setlur","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tableau Research, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Versalytix, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641967","id":37089641967,"full_name":"Bridget Cogley","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Versalytix, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"MIT CSAIL, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085729682","id":37085729682,"full_name":"Arvind Satyanarayan","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["MIT CSAIL, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"UC Berkeley, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38181244800","id":38181244800,"full_name":"Marti A.

When designing a visualization, text is often added to provide additional context and guidance for the reader. However, there is little experimental evidence to guide designers as to what is the right amount of text to show within a chart, what its qualitative properties should be, and where it should be placed. Prior work also shows variation in personal preferences for charts versus textual representations. In this paper, we explore several research questions about the relative value of textual components of visualizations. 302 participants ranked univariate line charts containing varying amounts of text, ranging from no text (except for the axes) to a written paragraph with no visuals. Participants also described what information they could take away from line charts containing text with varying semantic content. We find that heavily annotated charts were not penalized. In fact, participants preferred the charts with the largest number of textual annotations over charts with fewer annotations or text alone. We also find effects of semantic content. For instance, the text that describes statistical or relational components of a chart leads to more takeaways referring to statistics or relational comparisons than text describing elemental or encoded components. Finally, we find different effects for the semantic levels based on the placement of the text on the chart; some kinds of information are best placed in the title, while others should be placed closer to the data. We compile these results into four chart design guidelines and discuss future implications for the combination of text and charts.","article_number":"9904452","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904452","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904452/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904452/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"1233","end_page":"1243","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":876,"insert_date":"20220927","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Semantics","Data visualization","Annotations","Electronic mail","Market research","Guidelines"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","text","annotation","user preference","takeaways","design","line charts"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Semantic Content","Participant Preference","Participants Preferred","Text Representation","Semantic Level","Line Chart","Number Of Annotations","Amount Of Text","Combination Of Text","Text Annotation","Textual Components","Visual Information","Visual Analysis","Details Of Analysis","Design Space","Textual Information","External Information","Current Events","Combination Of Words","Preference Information","Preferred Information","Ranking Task","Chart Types","Chatbot","Visual Communication","External Context","Crowdsourced Data","Literacy Measures","Communication Preferences","Preferred Communication","Ranked Set"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209354","title":"HiTailor: Interactive Transformation and Visualization for Hierarchical Tabular Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":43,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Beijing Institute of Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086047700","id":37086047700,"full_name":"Guozheng Li","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Beijing Institute of Technology, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Beijing Institute of Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089642180","id":37089642180,"full_name":"Runfei Li","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Beijing Institute of Technology, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Beijing Institute of Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089642285","id":37089642285,"full_name":"Zicheng Wang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Beijing Institute of Technology, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Beijing Institute of Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38248076600","id":38248076600,"full_name":"Chi Harold Liu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Beijing Institute of Technology, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Shenzhen University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38238228600","id":38238228600,"full_name":"Min Lu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shenzhen University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Beijing Institute of Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37366385000","id":37366385000,"full_name":"Guoren Wang","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Beijing Institute of Technology, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Tabular visualization techniques integrate visual representations with tabular data to avoid additional cognitive load caused by splitting users' attention.

Rigel implements a new declarative mapping approach that formulates the data transformation procedure as direct mappings from data to the row, column, and cell channels of the target table. To construct such mappings, Rigel allows users to directly drag data attributes from input data to these three channels and indirectly drag or type data values in a spreadsheet, and possible mappings that do not contradict these interactions are recommended to achieve efficient and straightforward data transformation. The recommended mappings are generated by enumerating and composing data variables based on the row, column, and cell channels, thereby revealing the possibility of alternative tabular forms and facilitating open-ended exploration in many data transformation scenarios, such as designing tables for presentation. In contrast to existing systems that transform data by composing operations (like transposing and pivoting), Rigel requires less prior knowledge on these operations, and constructing tables from the channels is more efficient and results in less ambiguity than generating operation sequences as done by the traditional by-example approaches. User study results demonstrated that Rigel is significantly less demanding in terms of time and interactions and suits more scenarios compared to the state-of-the-art by-example approach. A gallery of diverse transformation cases is also presented to show the potential of Rigel's expressiveness.","article_number":"9908529","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9908529","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9908529/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9908529/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"128","end_page":"138","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":610,"insert_date":"20221003","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Transforms","Task analysis","Data models","Usability","Economic indicators","Data visualization","Writing"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data transformation","self-service data transformation","programming by example","declarative specification"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Ambiguity","Spreadsheet","User Study","Interactive System","Data Transformation","Direct Function","Direct Mapping","Transformation System","Row Of Table","Transformation Procedure","Usability","Ease Of Use","Task Completion","New Variables","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Disambiguation","Current Function","Current Map","City Level","Complete Function","Complete Map","Map Construction","Clear Goals","Variables In Table","Rows Of Cells","Usage Intention","Part Of The Map","Think-aloud Protocols","State For Years","Steep Learning Curve","Corresponding State","Readable Format","Average GDP"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209427","title":"Comparative Evaluation of Bipartite, Node-Link, and Matrix-Based Network Representations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":45,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086218451","id":37086218451,"full_name":"Moataz Abdelaal","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Leiden University, Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089642297","id":37089642297,"full_name":"Nathan D.

We consider three overview tasks on networks with 500 nodes: (T1) network class identification, (T2) cluster detection, and (T3) network density estimation, and two detailed tasks: (T4) node in-degree vs. out-degree and (T5) representation mapping, on networks with 50 and 20 nodes, respectively. Our results show that bipartite layouts are beneficial for revealing the overall network structure, while adjacency matrices are most reliable across the different tasks.","article_number":"9908291","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9908291","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9908291/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9908291/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"896","end_page":"906","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":995,"insert_date":"20221003","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Task analysis","Visualization","Layout","Bipartite graph","Clutter","Scalability","Rendering (computer graphics)"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Bipartite","network","visualization","evaluation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Network Representation","Dense Network","Sparse Network","Network Properties","Pathfinding","Optimal Route","Network Clustering","Network Size","Visual Network","Network Diagram","Guidelines For Use","Reference Image","Real-world Datasets","Real-world Data Sets","Density Profile","Visual Conditions","Visual Status","Agglomerative Clustering","Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering","Source Node","Network Comparison","Comparative Network","Target Node","Use Of Color","Use Of Colour","Color Manipulation","Small-world Network","Small World Network","Comparison Task","Objective Of Phase","Overview Of Networks","Main Hub","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Ordering Of The Vertices","Vertex Order","Strabismus","Phoria","Strabismic","Squint","Scalable","Limited Scalability","Node Attributes","Nodal Properties"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209407","title":"GenoREC: A Recommendation System for Interactive Genomics Data Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":46,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, MA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085662710","id":37085662710,"full_name":"Aditeya Pandey","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University, MA, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard Medical School, MA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085992020","id":37085992020,"full_name":"Sehi L'Yi","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard Medical School, MA, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard Medical School, MA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543277","id":37086543277,"full_name":"Qianwen Wang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard Medical School, MA, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, MA, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017334100","id":38017334100,"full_name":"Michelle A.

A large number of visualization techniques for genomics data and different analysis tasks pose a significant challenge for analysts: which visualization technique is most likely to help them generate insights into their data? Since genomics analysts typically have limited training in data visualization, their choices are often based on trial and error or guided by technical details, such as data formats that a specific tool can load. This approach prevents them from making effective visualization choices for the many combinations of data types and analysis questions they encounter in their work. Visualization recommendation systems assist non-experts in creating data visualization by recommending appropriate visualizations based on the data and task characteristics. However, existing visualization recommendation systems are not designed to handle domain-specific problems. To address these challenges, we designed GenoREC, a novel visualization recommendation system for genomics. GenoREC enables genomics analysts to select effective visualizations based on a description of their data and analysis tasks. Here, we present the recommendation model that uses a knowledge-based method for choosing appropriate visualizations and a web application that enables analysts to input their requirements, explore recommended visualizations, and export them for their usage. Furthermore, we present the results of two user studies demonstrating that GenoREC recommends visualizations that are both accepted by domain experts and suited to address the given genomics analysis problem.

In this work, we explore the design patterns of BTFW interaction commonly used in data stories. Six design patterns were identified through the analysis of 58 high-quality data stories collected from a range of online sources. Specifically, the data stories were categorized using a coding framework, including the input of BTFW interaction provided by readers and the output of BTFW interaction generated by data stories to respond to the input. To explore the benefits as well as concerns of using BTFW interaction, we conducted a three-session user study including the reading, interview, and recall sessions. The results of our user study suggested that BTFW interaction has a positive impact on self-story connection, user engagement, and information recall. We also discussed design implications to address the possible negative effects on the interactivity-comprehensibility balance, information privacy, and the learning curve of interaction brought by BTFW interaction.","article_number":"9903557","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9903557","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903557/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903557/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"972","end_page":"982","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":991,"insert_date":"20220926","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Interviews","Visualization","Task analysis","Navigation","Taxonomy","TV"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Interaction","data-driven storytelling","narrative devices"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Fourth Wall","Third Wall","Data Stories","Learning Curve","Learning Time","Data Privacy","Private Information","User Study","Interaction Patterns","User Input","User Engagement","Customer Engagement","Recall Of Information","Design Patterns","Interview Sessions","Coding Framework","Reading Sessions","Body Mass Index","Normal Weight","Interactive","Social Media","Social Platforms","Audience","Data Visualization","Types Of Interactions","Role Of Interactions","Interaction Techniques","Personal Data","Knowledge Inputs","Story Content","Reading Experience","Hospital Capacity","Storytelling","Domain Experts","Concept Of Interaction","Expert Interviews"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209453","title":"FlowNL: Asking the Flow Data in Natural Languages","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":48,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089642002","id":37089642002,"full_name":"Jieying Huang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641558","id":37089641558,"full_name":"Yang Xi","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089574361","id":37089574361,"full_name":"Junnan Hu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Zhuhai), School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, National Supercomputer Center in Guangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086054207","id":37086054207,"full_name":"Jun Tao","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Zhuhai), School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, National Supercomputer Center in Guangzhou, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Flow visualization is essentially a tool to answer domain experts' questions about flow fields using rendered images. Static flow visualization approaches require domain experts to raise their questions to visualization experts, who develop specific techniques to extract and visualize the flow structures of interest. Interactive visualization approaches allow domain experts to ask the system directly through the visual analytic interface, which provides flexibility to support various tasks. However, in practice, the visual analytic interface may require extra learning effort, which often discourages domain experts and limits its usage in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose FlowNL, a novel interactive system with a natural language interface. FlowNL allows users to manipulate the flow visualization system using plain English, which greatly reduces the learning effort. We develop a natural language parser to interpret user intention and translate textual input into a declarative language. We design the declarative language as an intermediate layer between the natural language and the programming language specifically for flow visualization. The declarative language provides selection and composition rules to derive relatively complicated flow structures from primitive objects that encode various kinds of information about scalar fields, flow patterns, regions of interest, connectivities, etc. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FlowNL using multiple usage scenarios and an empirical evaluation.","article_number":"9910021","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9910021","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9910021/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9910021/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"1200","end_page":"1210","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":746,"insert_date":"20221004","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Natural languages","Data visualization","Semantics","Engines","Task analysis","Spirals","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Flow visualization","natural language interface","interactive exploration","declarative grammar"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Natural Language","Interactive System","Flow Patterns","Flow Field","Domain Experts","Flow Structure","Interactive Visualization","Structures Of Interest","Flow Visualization","Geographic Regions","Streamline","Critical Point","High Humidity","Grid Points","Hurricane","Tropical Cyclones","Point Cloud","Point Clouds","Regional Flow","Design Requirements","Gulf Of Mexico","Object Relations","Rivulets","Streamlet","Latent Vector","Popular Science","Divulgation","Scientific Visualization","Semantic Ambiguity","Object Color","Upward Flow","Edit Distance","Immersive Environment","User Study"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209375","title":"Traveler: Navigating Task Parallel Traces for Performance Analysis","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":49,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Arizona, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085757591","id":37085757591,"full_name":"Sayef Azad Sakin","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Arizona, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Stardog, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085905494","id":37085905494,"full_name":"Alex Bigelow","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Stardog, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Louisiana State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086637683","id":37086637683,"full_name":"R.

This is especially important in high performance computing contexts where even minor performance tweaks can translate into large savings in terms of computational resource use. To aid performance analysis, developers may collect an execution trace—a chronological log of program activity during execution. As traces represent the full history, developers can discover a wide array of possibly previously unknown performance issues, making them an important artifact for exploratory performance analysis. However, interactive trace visualization is difficult due to issues of data size and complexity of meaning. Traces represent nanosecond-level events across many parallel processes, meaning the collected data is often large and difficult to explore. The rise of asynchronous task parallel programming paradigms complicates the relation between events and their probable cause. To address these challenges, we conduct a continuing design study in collaboration with high performance computing researchers. We develop diverse and hierarchical ways to navigate and represent execution trace data in support of their trace analysis tasks. Through an iterative design process, we developed Traveler, an integrated visualization platform for task parallel traces. Traveler provides multiple linked interfaces to help navigate trace data from multiple contexts. We evaluate the utility of Traveler through feedback from users and a case study, finding that integrating multiple modes of navigation in our design supported performance analysis tasks and led to the discovery of previously unknown behavior in a distributed array library.","article_number":"9904447","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904447","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904447/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904447/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"788","end_page":"797","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":437,"insert_date":"20220927","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Task analysis","Performance analysis","Measurement","Data visualization","Codes","Navigation","High performance computing"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["software visualization","parallel computing","traces","performance analysis","event sequence visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Navigation","Use Of Resources","Exploitation Of Resources","Computational Resources","Parallelization","Parallel Computing","High-performance Computing","Supercomputer","Analysis Tasks","Trace Data","Team Members","Source Code","Data Compression","Effect Of Duration","Duration Of Events","Start Time","Level Of Abstraction","Tree Nodes","Highest Use","Highest Usage","Highest Utility","Vast Differences","Interval Distribution","Higher Level Of Abstraction","Client-side","Client Side","2-tier","Task Scheduling","Evaluation Session","Session Rating","L2 Cache","Cache Misses","Cache-miss","Multiple Levels Of Abstraction","Trace Length","Trace Lengths","Ongoing Collaboration","CPU Utilization","Expert Users","Supplemental Material"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209466","title":"Visual Concept Programming: A Visual Analytics Approach to Injecting Human Intelligence at Scale","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":50,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Maryland, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089574108","id":37089574108,"full_name":"Md Naimul Hoque","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Bosch Research North America, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085433063","id":37085433063,"full_name":"Wenbin He","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Bosch Research North America, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Robert Bosch GmbH, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656316","id":37088656316,"full_name":"Arvind Kumar Shekar","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Robert Bosch GmbH, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Bosch Research North America, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37075500200","id":37075500200,"full_name":"Liang Gou","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Bosch Research North America, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Bosch Research North America, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086048784","id":37086048784,"full_name":"Liu Ren","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Bosch Research North America, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Data-centric AI has emerged as a new research area to systematically engineer the data to land AI models for real-world applications. As a core method for data-centric AI, data programming helps experts inject domain knowledge into data and label data at scale using carefully designed labeling functions (e.g., heuristic rules, logistics). Though data programming has shown great success in the NLP domain, it is challenging to program image data because of a) the challenge to describe images using visual vocabulary without human annotations and b) lacking efficient tools for data programming of images. We present Visual Concept Programming, a first-of-its-kind visual analytics approach of using visual concepts to program image data at scale while requiring a few human efforts. Our approach is built upon three unique components. It first uses a self-supervised learning approach to learn visual representation at the pixel level and extract a dictionary of visual concepts from images without using any human annotations. The visual concepts serve as building blocks of labeling functions for experts to inject their domain knowledge. We then design interactive visualizations to explore and understand visual concepts and compose labeling functions with concepts without writing code. Finally, with the composed labeling functions, users can label the image data at scale and use the labeled data to refine the pixel-wise visual representation and concept quality. We evaluate the learned pixel-wise visual representation for the downstream task of semantic segmentation to show the effectiveness and usefulness of our approach. In addition, we demonstrate how our approach tackles real-world problems of image retrieval for autonomous driving.","article_number":"9904017","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904017","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904017/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904017/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"74","end_page":"83","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1576,"insert_date":"20220927","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Programming","Labeling","Data models","Artificial intelligence","Task analysis","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual concept programming","data-centric AI","data programming","self-supervised learning","semantic segmentation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Visual Programming","Visual Concepts","Visual Analytics Approach","Imaging Data","Representation Learning","Semantic Segmentation","Labeled Data","Image Retrieval","Image Search","Self-supervised Learning","Contrastive Learning","Visual Approach","Learning Models","Convolutional Neural Network","Machine Learning Models","Relative Size","Image Segmentation","Interfacial Interaction","Human Cognition","Human Knowledge","Traffic Light","Unlabeled Data","Primary Concept","Weak Labels","View Of The Scene","Weak Supervision","Similar Embeddings","Relevant Concepts","Visual Interface","Conceptual Combination","Image Embedding","Concept Extraction"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209468","title":"DashBot: Insight-Driven Dashboard Generation Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":51,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086544875","id":37086544875,"full_name":"Dazhen Deng","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086808853","id":37086808853,"full_name":"Aoyu Wu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","id":37407308300,"full_name":"Yingcai Wu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","Alibaba-Zhejiang University Joint Research Institute of Frontier Technologies, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Analytical dashboards are popular in business intelligence to facilitate insight discovery with multiple charts. However, creating an effective dashboard is highly demanding, which requires users to have adequate data analysis background and be familiar with professional tools, such as Power BI. To create a dashboard, users have to configure charts by selecting data columns and exploring different chart combinations to optimize the communication of insights, which is trial-and-error. Recent research has started to use deep learning methods for dashboard generation to lower the burden of visualization creation. However, such efforts are greatly hindered by the lack of large-scale and high-quality datasets of dashboards. In this work, we propose using deep reinforcement learning to generate analytical dashboards that can use well-established visualization knowledge and the estimation capacity of reinforcement learning. Specifically, we use visualization knowledge to construct a training environment and rewards for agents to explore and imitate human exploration behavior with a well-designed agent network. The usefulness of the deep reinforcement learning model is demonstrated through ablation studies and user studies. In conclusion, our work opens up new opportunities to develop effective ML-based visualization recommenders without beforehand training datasets.","article_number":"9906971","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9906971","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9906971/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9906971/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"690","end_page":"700","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1241,"insert_date":"20220930","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Deep learning","Training","Neural networks","Encoding","Q-learning"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Reinforcement Learning","Visualization Recommendation","Multiple-View Visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Deep Learning","Deep Reinforcement Learning","Human Behavior","Human Behaviour","User Study","Large-scale Datasets","Large-scale Data Sets","Network Of Agents","Reinforcement Learning Model","Professional Tool","Insightful Findings","Discovery Of Insights","Deep Reinforcement Learning Model","Deep Neural Network","Long Short-term Memory","Long Short Term Memory","LSTM","Learning-based Methods","Learning-based Method","Design Considerations","Network Design","Handcrafted Features","Activity Prediction","Action Anticipation","Reward Function","Recommender Systems","Deep Learning-based Methods","Deep Learning-based Method","Chart Types","Visual Encoding","Rule-based Methods","Rule-based Method","Markov Decision Process","ML-based Methods","ML-based Method","Visual Channels","Actual Probability","Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory","Bidirectional LSTM","Statistical Metrics","Generation Problem"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209436","title":"Communicating Uncertainty in Digital Humanities Visualization Research","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":52,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"KU Leuven & UCL Interaction Center, Belgium","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088539641","id":37088539641,"full_name":"Georgia Panagiotidou","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["KU Leuven & UCL Interaction Center, Belgium"]}},{"affiliation":"KU Leuven, Belgium","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655412","id":37088655412,"full_name":"Houda Lamqaddam","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["KU Leuven, Belgium"]}},{"affiliation":"KU Leuven, Belgium","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089574527","id":37089574527,"full_name":"Jeroen Poblome","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["KU Leuven, Belgium"]}},{"affiliation":"KU Leuven, Belgium","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656288","id":37088656288,"full_name":"Koenraad Brosens","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["KU Leuven, Belgium"]}},{"affiliation":"KU Leuven, Belgium","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38527413500","id":38527413500,"full_name":"Katrien Verbert","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["KU Leuven, Belgium"]}},{"affiliation":"KU Leuven, Belgium","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283186600","id":37283186600,"full_name":"Andrew Vande Moere","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["KU Leuven, Belgium"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Due to their historical nature, humanistic data encompass multiple sources of uncertainty. While humanists are accustomed to handling such uncertainty with their established methods, they are cautious of visualizations that appear overly objective and fail to communicate this uncertainty. To design more trustworthy visualizations for humanistic research, therefore, a deeper understanding of its relation to uncertainty is needed. We systematically reviewed 126 publications from digital humanities literature that use visualization as part of their research process, and examined how uncertainty was handled and represented in their visualizations. Crossing these dimensions with the visualization type and use, we identified that uncertainty originated from multiple steps in the research process from the source artifacts to their datafication. We also noted how besides known uncertainty coping strategies, such as excluding data and evaluating its effects, humanists also embraced uncertainty as a separate dimension important to retain. By mapping how the visualizations encoded uncertainty, we identified four approaches that varied in terms of explicitness and customization. This work contributes with two empirical taxonomies of uncertainty and it's corresponding coping strategies, as well as with the foundation of a research agenda for uncertainty visualization in the digital humanities. Our findings further the synergy among humanists and visualization researchers, and ultimately contribute to the development of more trustworthy, uncertainty-aware visualizations.","article_number":"9904442","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904442","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904442/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904442/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"635","end_page":"645","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":688,"insert_date":"20220927","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Uncertainty","Humanities","Taxonomy","Task analysis","Data analysis","Visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["digital humanities","data visualization","uncertainty","review"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209395","title":"Computing a Stable Distance on Merge Trees","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":53,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Mathematics, The University of Arizona, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089646374","id":37089646374,"full_name":"Brian Bollen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Mathematics, The University of Arizona, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, The University of Arizona, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089643485","id":37089643485,"full_name":"Pasindu Tennakoon","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, The University of Arizona, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, The University of Arizona, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37853884500","id":37853884500,"full_name":"Joshua A.

Two desirable properties for these distances to exhibit are 1) the ability to discern between scalar fields which other, less complex topological summaries cannot and 2) to still be robust to perturbations in the dataset. The combination of these two properties, known respectively as stability and discriminativity, has led to theoretical distances which are either thought to be or shown to be computationally complex and thus their implementations have been scarce. In order to design similarity measures on merge trees which are computationally feasible for more complex merge trees, many researchers have elected to loosen the restrictions on at least one of these two properties. The question still remains, however, if there are practical situations where trading these desirable properties is necessary. Here we construct a distance between merge trees which is designed to retain both discriminativity and stability. While our approach can be expensive for large merge trees, we illustrate its use in a setting where the number of nodes is small. This setting can be made more practical since we also provide a proof that persistence simplification increases the outputted distance by at most half of the simplified value. We demonstrate our distance measure on applications in shape comparison and on detection of periodicity in the von Kármán vortex street.","article_number":"9912347","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9912347","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9912347/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9912347/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"1168","end_page":"1177","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":284,"insert_date":"20221005","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Topology","Distortion","Stability criteria","Perturbation methods","Thermal stability","Shape measurement","Shape"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Merge trees","scalar fields","distance measure","stability","edit distance","persistence"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Merging Algorithm","Merge Tree","Computational Complexity","Similarity Measure","Similarity Metrics","Computationally Intractable","Computationally Infeasible","Intractable Problem","Computational Feasibility","Data Structure","Pairing","Computation Time","Calculation Time","Distance Matrix","Distance Matrices","Root Node","Parent Node","Heuristic Algorithm","Heuristic Function","Seahorse","Lowest Cost","Subtree","Edit Distance","Geodesic Distance","Joining Tree","Junction Tree","Tree-decomposition","Tree Decomposition","Centaur","True Cost","Topological Indices","Topological Index","Topological Descriptors","Sequence Editing","Topological Data Analysis","Current Matching","Priority Queue","True Distance","Algorithm Ends"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209352","title":"Tac-Trainer: A Visual Analytics System for IoT-based Racket Sports Training","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":54,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086242334","id":37086242334,"full_name":"Jiachen Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641405","id":37089641405,"full_name":"Ji Ma","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641202","id":37089641202,"full_name":"Kangping Hu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Sports Science, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087099605","id":37087099605,"full_name":"Zheng Zhou","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Sports Science, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Sports Science, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086236404","id":37086236404,"full_name":"Hui Zhang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Sports Science, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086448603","id":37086448603,"full_name":"Xiao Xie","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","Alibaba-Zhejiang University Joint Research Institute of Frontier Technologies, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","id":37407308300,"full_name":"Yingcai Wu","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","Alibaba-Zhejiang University Joint Research Institute of Frontier Technologies, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Conventional racket sports training highly relies on coaches' knowledge and experience, leading to biases in the guidance.

We aim at finding a suitable mapping between the research groups and the grid cells such that the department structure forms a base map layout. Our objectives are to optimize both the compactness of the entirety of all cells and of each set by itself. We show that computing the mapping is NP-hard. However, using integer linear programming we can solve real-world instances optimally within a few seconds. Moreover, we propose a relaxation of the contiguity requirement to visualize otherwise non-embeddable set systems. We present and discuss different rendering styles for the set overlays. Based on a case study with real-world data, our evaluation comprises quantitative measures as well as expert interviews.","article_number":"9904435","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904435","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904435/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904435/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"875","end_page":"885","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":400,"insert_date":"20220927","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Collaboration","Physiology","Economics","Crops","Bioinformatics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Set Visualization","Euler Diagram","Integer Linear Programming","Hypergraph"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Grid Graph","Lattice Graph","Research Group","Visual Information","Grid Cells","Set Of Elements","Regular Grid","Cartesian Grid","Grid Structure","Rectangular Grid","Square Grid","Base Map","Basemap","Expert Interviews","Contiguous Regions","Hierarchical Structure","Hierarchical Organization","Running Time","Perimeter","Feasible Solution","Interaction Map","Problem Setting","Empty Cells","Mapping Unit","Centimorgans","Unique Elements","Grid Map","Hypergraph","Grid Frequency","Grid Center","Hamiltonian Path","Hamiltonian Cycle","Side Constraints","Running Example","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Choropleth Maps","Compact Region","Planar Graphs","Planar Maps"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209411","title":"sMolBoxes: Dataflow Model for Molecular Dynamics Exploration","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":58,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Visitlab, Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, Czech Republic","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086932309","id":37086932309,"full_name":"Pavol Ulbrich","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visitlab, Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, Czech Republic"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Wien, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37844773200","id":37844773200,"full_name":"Manuela Waldner","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Wien, Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Visitlab, Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, Czech Republic","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085718278","id":37085718278,"full_name":"Katarína Furmanová","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visitlab, Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, Czech Republic"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Experimental Biology, Loschmidt Laboratories, Faculty of Science, RECETOX, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088521473","id":37088521473,"full_name":"Sérgio M.

When MD simulations reach millions of snapshots, a frame-by-frame observation is not feasible anymore. Thus, biochemists rely to a large extent only on quantitative analysis of geometric and physico-chemical properties. However, the usage of abstract methods to study inherently spatial data hinders the exploration and poses a considerable workload. sMolBoxes link quantitative analysis of a user-defined set of properties with interactive 3D visualizations. They enable visual explanations of molecular behaviors, which lead to an efficient discovery of biochemically significant parts of the MD simulation. sMolBoxes follow a node-based model for flexible definition, combination, and immediate evaluation of properties to be investigated. Progressive analytics enable fluid switching between multiple properties, which facilitates hypothesis generation. Each sMolBox provides quick insight to an observed property or function, available in more detail in the bigBox View. The case studies illustrate that even with relatively few sMolBoxes, it is possible to express complex analytical tasks, and their use in exploratory analysis is perceived as more efficient than traditional scripting-based methods.","article_number":"9903280","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9903280","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903280/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903280/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"581","end_page":"590","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":407,"insert_date":"20220926","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Proteins","Analytical models","Biological system modeling","Three-dimensional displays","Computational modeling","Task analysis","Animation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Molecular dynamics","structure","node-based visualization","progressive analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Molecular Dynamics","Exploratory Analysis","Exploratory Data Analysis","Molecular Dynamics Simulations","Geometric Properties","Geometric Dimensions","3D Visualization","Interactive Visualization","Active Site","Root Mean Square Error","Root-mean-square Deviation","Root-mean-square Error","RMSD","RMSE","Conformational Changes","Visual Analysis","Combination Of Measures","Catalytic Residues","Domain Experts","Protein Engineering","Simulated Events","Multiple Residues","Approximate Computation","Approximate Calculation","Caching","Iterative Manner","Line Chart","Co-authors Of This Paper","Aggregation Function","3D Animation","Visual Exploration","Simulation Snapshots","Thousands Of Atoms","Exploration Of Properties","Workflow","Hidden Markov Model"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209391","title":"DPVisCreator: Incorporating Pattern Constraints to Privacy-preserving Visualizations via Differential Privacy","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":59,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089642674","id":37089642674,"full_name":"Jiehui Zhou","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"TMCC, CS, Nankai University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086258030","id":37086258030,"full_name":"Xumeng Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TMCC, CS, Nankai University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641965","id":37089641965,"full_name":"Jason K.

In this paper, we propose a visual analytics approach that facilitates data custodians to generate multiple private charts while maintaining user-preferred patterns. To this end, we introduce pattern constraints to model users' preferences over data patterns in the dataset and incorporate them into the proposed Bayesian network-based Differential Privacy (DP) model PriVis. A prototype system, DPVisCreator, is developed to assist data custodians in implementing our approach.

Rather than building bounding volume hierarchies (BVHs) over individual elements, we sort elements along with a Hilbert curve and aggregate neighboring elements together, improving BVH memory consumption by over an order of magnitude. Then to further reduce memory consumption, we cluster the mesh on the fly into sub-meshes with smaller indices using a series of efficient parallel mesh re-indexing operations. These clusters are then passed to a highly optimized ray tracing API for point containment queries and ray-cluster intersection testing. Each cluster is assigned a maximum extinction value for adaptive sampling, which we rasterize into non-overlapping view-aligned bins allocated along the ray. These maximum extinction bins are then used to guide the placement of samples along the ray during visualization, reducing the number of samples required by multiple orders of magnitude (depending on the dataset), thereby improving overall visualization interactivity. Using our approach, we improve rendering performance over a competitive baseline on the NASA Mars Lander dataset from 6× (1 frame per second (fps) and 1.0 M rays per second (rps) up to now 6 fps and 12.4 M rps, now including volumetric shadows) while simultaneously reducing memory consumption by 3×(33 GB down to 11 GB) and avoiding any offline preprocessing steps, enabling high-quality interactive visualization on consumer graphics cards.

Despite its advantages, today's quantum computers intrinsically suffer from noise and are error-prone. To guarantee the high fidelity of the execution result of a quantum algorithm, it is crucial to inform users of the noises of the used quantum computer and the compiled physical circuits. However, an intuitive and systematic way to make users aware of the quantum computing noise is still missing. In this paper, we fill the gap by proposing a novel visualization approach to achieve noise-aware quantum computing. It provides a holistic picture of the noise of quantum computing through multiple interactively coordinated views: a Computer Evolution View with a circuit-like design overviews the temporal evolution of the noises of different quantum computers, a Circuit Filtering View facilitates quick filtering of multiple compiled physical circuits for the same quantum algorithm, and a Circuit Comparison View with a coupled bar chart enables detailed comparison of the filtered compiled circuits. We extensively evaluate the performance of VACSEN through two case studies on quantum algorithms of different scales and in-depth interviews with 12 quantum computing users. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of VACSEN in achieving noise-aware quantum computing.","article_number":"9904430","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904430","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904430/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904430/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"462","end_page":"472","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":479,"insert_date":"20220927","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Quantum computing","Qubit","Visualization","Logic gates","Quantum algorithm","Quantum circuit","Reliability"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","quantum computing","noise awareness"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Quantum Computing","Visual Approach","In-depth Interviews","Bar Charts","Classical Computer","Classical Calculations","Quantum Algorithms","Error Rate","Design Requirements","Line Segment","Domain Experts","Quantum State","Horizontal Coordinates","Target User","Control Panel","Visual Design","Noise Analysis","Quantization Noise","Qubit State","Quantum Circuit","Quantum Gates","Years Of Research Experience","User Interviews","Quantum Error Correction","Quantum Programs","Quantum Codes","Purple Box","Intuitive Design","Blue Circles","Queuing Time","Principal Curvatures","Curved Lines"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209431","title":"PSEUDo: Interactive Pattern Search in Multivariate Time Series with Locality-Sensitive Hashing and Relevance Feedback","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":64,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Utrecht University, Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641071","id":37089641071,"full_name":"Yuncong Yu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Utrecht University, Netherlands","IAV GmbH, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"NAVARA, Japan","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089642875","id":37089642875,"full_name":"Dylan Kruyff","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["NAVARA, Japan"]}},{"affiliation":"Utrecht University, Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089640938","id":37089640938,"full_name":"Jiao Jiao","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Utrecht University, Netherlands","Fraunhofer ISI, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"IAV GmbH, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641770","id":37089641770,"full_name":"Tim Becker","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IAV GmbH, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Utrecht University, Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38551542600","id":38551542600,"full_name":"Michael Behrisch","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Utrecht University, Netherlands"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present PSEUDo, a visual pattern retrieval tool for multivariate time series. It aims to overcome the uneconomic (re-)training problem accompanying deep learning-based methods. Very high-dimensional time series emerge on an unprecedented scale due to increasing sensor usage and data storage. Visual pattern search is one of the most frequent tasks on time series. Automatic pattern retrieval methods often suffer from inefficient training data, a lack of ground truth labels, and a discrepancy between the similarity perceived by the algorithm and required by the user or the task. Our proposal is based on the query-aware locality-sensitive hashing technique to create a representation of multivariate time series windows. It features sub-linear training and inference time with respect to data dimensions. This performance gain allows an instantaneous relevance-feedback-driven adaption to converge to users' similarity notion. We demonstrate PSEUDo's performance in terms of accuracy, speed, steerability, and usability through quantitative benchmarks with representative time series retrieval methods and a case study. We find that PSEUDo detects patterns in high-dimensional time series efficiently, improves the result with relevance feedback through feature selection, and allows an understandable as well as user-friendly retrieval process.","article_number":"9904933","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904933","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904933/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904933/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"33","end_page":"42","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":596,"insert_date":"20220928","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Time series analysis","Hash functions","Data models","Electronic mail","Visualization","Task analysis","Compounds"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["time series","pattern search","locality-sensitive hashing","relevance feedback"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Time Series","Time-series","Pattern Search","Multivariate Time Series","Multivariate Time-series","Univariate Time Series","Relevant Feedback","Locality Sensitive Hashing","Locality-sensitive Hashing","Ground Truth Labels","Similar Note","Time Series Patterns","Time-series Patterns","Representative Time Series","Scalable","Convolutional Neural Network","Conceptual Model","Similarity Measure","Similarity Metrics","Active Learning","F1 Score","F-measure","Fast Fourier Transform","Inverse Fast Fourier Transform","Time Series Analysis","Time-series Analysis","Intersection Over Union","Jaccard Similarity","Jaccard Distance","Intersection-over-union","Jaccard Index","Hash Function","Hash Table","Hash Value","Hash Codes","Discrete Fourier Transform","Dynamic Time Warping","Multivariate Time Series Data","Multivariate Time-series Data","Smart Meters","High-dimensional Datasets","High-dimensional Data Sets","Rounds Of Feedback","Overview Of The Dataset","Overview Of Data Sets","Number Of Tracks","Positive Labels","Candidate Samples","Singular Value Decomposition"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209377","title":"Dispersion vs Disparity: Hiding Variability Can Encourage Stereotyping When Visualizing Social Outcomes","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":65,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"3iap, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641365","id":37089641365,"full_name":"Eli Holder","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["3iap, China"]}},{"affiliation":"UMass Amherst, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102197","id":37087102197,"full_name":"Cindy Xiong","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UMass Amherst, United States"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Visualization research often focuses on perceptual accuracy or helping readers interpret key messages. However, we know very little about how chart designs might influence readers' perceptions of the people behind the data. Specifically, could designs interact with readers' social cognitive biases in ways that perpetuate harmful stereotypes? For example, when analyzing social inequality, bar charts are a popular choice to present outcome disparities between race, gender, or other groups. But bar charts may encourage deficit thinking, the perception that outcome disparities are caused by groups' personal strengths or deficiencies, rather than external factors. These faulty personal attributions can then reinforce stereotypes about the groups being visualized. We conducted four experiments examining design choices that influence attribution biases (and therefore deficit thinking). Crowdworkers viewed visualizations depicting social outcomes that either mask variability in data, such as bar charts or dot plots, or emphasize variability in data, such as jitter plots or prediction intervals. They reported their agreement with both personal and external explanations for the visualized disparities. Overall, when participants saw visualizations that hide within-group variability, they agreed more with personal explanations. When they saw visualizations that emphasize within-group variability, they agreed less with personal explanations. These results demonstrate that data visualizations about social inequity can be misinterpreted in harmful ways and lead to stereotyping. Design choices can influence these biases: Hiding variability tends to increase stereotyping while emphasizing variability reduces it.","article_number":"9913065","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9913065","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9913065/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9913065/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"624","end_page":"634","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":451,"insert_date":"20221006","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Bars","Jitter","Uncertainty","NASA","Dispersion","Systematics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Deficit Thinking","Fundamental Attribution Error","Correspondence Bias","Storytelling","Diversity","Equity"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Social Outcomes","Variance In The Data","Social Inequalities","Economic Deprivation","Social Inequities","Private Property","Personality Dimensions","Personal Attributes","Design Choices","Bar Charts","Dot Plots","Disparities In Outcomes","Disparate Results","Perceptions Of People","Prediction Intervals","Within-group Variation","Personal Strengths","Personal Strength","Attribution Bias","Attributional Biases","Harmful Stereotypes","Confidence Interval","Differences In Properties","Political Orientation","Political Attitudes","Political Spectrum","Political Positions","Post-hoc Comparisons","Exploratory Data","Number Of Data Points","External Attribution","External Properties","Equal Sample Sizes","Unequal Sample Sizes","Account Differences","Chart Types","Visual Design","Agreement Rate","Type Of Visualization","Uneven Sample Sizes","Tukey Adjustment"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209380","title":"PMU Tracker: A Visualization Platform for Epicentric Event Propagation Analysis in the Power Grid","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":66,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Arizona State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089171042","id":37089171042,"full_name":"Anjana Arunkumar","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086556669","id":37086556669,"full_name":"Andrea Pinceti","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37320277200","id":37320277200,"full_name":"Lalitha Sankar","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085724978","id":37085724978,"full_name":"Chris Bryan","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The electrical power grid is a critical infrastructure, with disruptions in transmission having severe repercussions on daily activities, across multiple sectors. To identify, prevent, and mitigate such events, power grids are being refurbished as ‘smart’ systems that include the widespread deployment of GPS-enabled phasor measurement units (PMUs). PMUs provide fast, precise, and time-synchronized measurements of voltage and current, enabling real-time wide-area monitoring and control. However, the potential benefits of PMUs, for analyzing grid events like abnormal power oscillations and load fluctuations, are hindered by the fact that these sensors produce large, concurrent volumes of noisy data. In this paper, we describe working with power grid engineers to investigate how this problem can be addressed from a visual analytics perspective. As a result, we have developed PMU Tracker, an event localization tool that supports power grid operators in visually analyzing and identifying power grid events and tracking their propagation through the power grid's network. As a part of the PMU Tracker interface, we develop a novel visualization technique which we term an epicentric cluster dendrogram, which allows operators to analyze the effects of an event as it propagates outwards from a source location. We robustly validate PMU Tracker with: (1) a usage scenario demonstrating how PMU Tracker can be used to analyze anomalous grid events, and (2) case studies with power grid operators using a real-world interconnection dataset. Our results indicate that PMU Tracker effectively supports the analysis of power grid events; we also demonstrate and discuss how PMU Tracker's visual analytics approach can be generalized to other domains composed of time-varying networks with epicentric event characteristics.","article_number":"9903279","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9903279","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903279/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903279/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"1081","end_page":"1090","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":405,"insert_date":"20220926","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Phasor measurement units","Data visualization","Power grids","Real-time systems","Voltage measurement","Oscillators","Monitoring"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Human-centered computing","Dendrograms","Visualization design and evaluation methods","Cyber-physical networks"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Power Grid","Phasor Measurement Units","Synchrophasor","Analysis Of Effects","Analysis Of Events","Dendrogram","Visual Analysis","Noisy Data","Visualization Techniques","Critical Infrastructure","Utility Grid","Grid Operation","Usage Scenarios","Load Fluctuations","Local Effects","Local Events","Years Of Data","Annual Data","Power System","Fast Fourier Transform","Inverse Fast Fourier Transform","Historical Events","Effect Of History","Oscillation Frequency","Data Streams","Power Line","Powerline","Gridded Data","Industrial Platform","Industry Platform","High-voltage Lines","High-voltage Transmission Lines","High Voltage Transmission Lines","Cyber-physical Systems","Cyber Physical Systems","Line Chart","Concurrent Effects","Concurrent Events","Tracking Of Events","Oscillation Events","Anomalous Behavior","Anomalous Behaviour","Contingency Analysis","Flow Map"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209449","title":"Predicting User Preferences of Dimensionality Reduction Embedding Quality","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":67,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089657422","id":37089657422,"full_name":"Cristina Morariu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Université catholique de Louvain, Belgium","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088965814","id":37088965814,"full_name":"Adrien Bibal","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Université catholique de Louvain, Belgium","University of Namur, Belgium"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088662389","id":37088662389,"full_name":"Rene Cutura","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Namur, Belgium","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085394487","id":37085394487,"full_name":"Benoît Frénay","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Namur, Belgium"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590945600","id":37590945600,"full_name":"Michael Sedlmair","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"OPEN_ACCESS","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"A plethora of dimensionality reduction techniques have emerged over the past decades, leaving researchers and analysts with a wide variety of choices for reducing their data, all the more so given some techniques come with additional hyper-parametrization (e.g., t-SNE, UMAP, etc.). Recent studies are showing that people often use dimensionality reduction as a black-box regardless of the specific properties the method itself preserves. Hence, evaluating and comparing 2D embeddings is usually qualitatively decided, by setting embeddings side-by-side and letting human judgment decide which embedding is the best. In this work, we propose a quantitative way of evaluating embeddings, that nonetheless places human perception at the center. We run a comparative study, where we ask people to select “good” and “misleading” views between scatterplots of low-dimensional embeddings of image datasets, simulating the way people usually select embeddings. We use the study data as labels for a set of quality metrics for a supervised machine learning model whose purpose is to discover and quantify what exactly people are looking for when deciding between embeddings. With the model as a proxy for human judgments, we use it to rank embeddings on new datasets, explain why they are relevant, and quantify the degree of subjectivity when people select preferred embeddings.","article_number":"9904619","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904619","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904619/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904619/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"745","end_page":"755","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":787,"insert_date":"20220927","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Measurement","Task analysis","Data visualization","Computational modeling","Visualization","Supervised learning","Principal component analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Dimensionality reduction","Manifold learning","Human-centered computing"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Dimensionality Reduction","User Preferences","Embedding Quality","Predict User Preferences","Supervised Learning","Supervised Classification","Supervised Machine Learning","Image Dataset","Quality Metrics","Uniform Manifold Approximation","Set Of Metrics","Low-dimensional Embedding","Accurate Measurement","High-dimensional","High-dimensional Space","Supplemental Material","Continuous Measure","User Study","Learning Community","Good And Bad","Good And Evil","Low-dimensional Space","Lower-dimensional Space","Dimensionality Reduction Methods","Dimensionality Reduction Method","Accuracy Metrics","Combination Of Metrics","Human Preferences","Humane Orientation","Machine Learning Community","Exploration Task","Neighborhood Size","Neighbourhood Size","Subjective Preferences","Ranking Score","Perplexity","Dataset In Order","Data Sets In Order","Lasso Penalty","Lasso Penalization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209489","title":"Calibrate: Interactive Analysis of Probabilistic Model Output","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":68,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"New York University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086009198","id":37086009198,"full_name":"Peter Xenopoulos","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"New York University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089568319","id":37089568319,"full_name":"João Rulff","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"ICMC-USP, São Carlos, Brazil","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590974800","id":37590974800,"full_name":"Luis Gustavo Nonato","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["ICMC-USP, São Carlos, Brazil"]}},{"affiliation":"Capital One, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089237382","id":37089237382,"full_name":"Brian Barr","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Capital One, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"New York University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275249200","id":37275249200,"full_name":"Claudio Silva","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Analyzing classification model performance is a crucial task for machine learning practitioners. While practitioners often use count-based metrics derived from confusion matrices, like accuracy, many applications, such as weather prediction, sports betting, or patient risk prediction, rely on a classifier's predicted probabilities rather than predicted labels. In these instances, practitioners are concerned with producing a calibrated model, that is, one which outputs probabilities that reflect those of the true distribution. Model calibration is often analyzed visually, through static reliability diagrams, however, the traditional calibration visualization may suffer from a variety of drawbacks due to the strong aggregations it necessitates. Furthermore, count-based approaches are unable to sufficiently analyze model calibration. We present Calibrate, an interactive reliability diagram that addresses the aforementioned issues. Calibrate constructs a reliability diagram that is resistant to drawbacks in traditional approaches, and allows for interactive subgroup analysis and instance-level inspection. We demonstrate the utility of Calibrate through use cases on both real-world and synthetic data. We further validate Calibrate by presenting the results of a think-aloud experiment with data scientists who routinely analyze model calibration.","article_number":"9904444","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904444","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904444/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904444/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"853","end_page":"863","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":523,"insert_date":"20220927","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Calibration","Reliability","Analytical models","Measurement","Predictive models","Machine learning","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["calibration","performance analysis","model understanding","reliability diagram"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Machine Learning","Machine-learning","Model Performance","Subgroup Analysis","Confusion Matrix","Confusion Matrices","Real-world Data","Model Calibration","Label Prediction","Performance Metrics","Interactive System","Important Task","Predictive Distribution","Truth Labels","Class Imbalance","Minority Class","Expert Interviews","True Class","Jupyter Notebook","True Probability","Brier Score","Subgroups Of Interest","Log Loss","Scoring Rules","Model Performance Metrics","Binning Strategy","Binning Scheme","Expert Feedback","Visual Analytics Tool","Use Of Mindfulness","Multi-label","Multi-class Classification","Multi-label Classification","Feature Engineering","Machine Learning Models"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209384","title":"ConceptExplainer: Interactive Explanation for Deep Neural Networks from a Concept Perspective","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":69,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Arizona State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089177470","id":37089177470,"full_name":"Jinbin Huang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089415905","id":37089415905,"full_name":"Aditi Mishra","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"IBM research, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085677185","id":37085677185,"full_name":"Bum Chul Kwon","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IBM research, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085724978","id":37085724978,"full_name":"Chris Bryan","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Traditional deep learning interpretability methods which are suitable for model users cannot explain network behaviors at the global level and are inflexible at providing fine-grained explanations. As a solution, concept-based explanations are gaining attention due to their human intuitiveness and their flexibility to describe both global and local model behaviors. Concepts are groups of similarly meaningful pixels that express a notion, embedded within the network's latent space and have commonly been hand-generated, but have recently been discovered by automated approaches. Unfortunately, the magnitude and diversity of discovered concepts makes it difficult to navigate and make sense of the concept space. Visual analytics can serve a valuable role in bridging these gaps by enabling structured navigation and exploration of the concept space to provide concept-based insights of model behavior to users. To this end, we design, develop, and validate ConceptExplainer, a visual analytics system that enables people to interactively probe and explore the concept space to explain model behavior at the instance/class/global level. The system was developed via iterative prototyping to address a number of design challenges that model users face in interpreting the behavior of deep learning models. Via a rigorous user study, we validate how ConceptExplainer supports these challenges. Likewise, we conduct a series of usage scenarios to demonstrate how the system supports the interactive analysis of model behavior across a variety of tasks and explanation granularities, such as identifying concepts that are important to classification, identifying bias in training data, and understanding how concepts can be shared across diverse and seemingly dissimilar classes.","article_number":"9903285","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9903285","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903285/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903285/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"831","end_page":"841","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":782,"insert_date":"20220926","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Behavioral sciences","Deep learning","Analytical models","Visual analytics","Navigation","Computational modeling","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Explainable AI","Concept Activation Vectors","Interactive Visual Analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Neural Network","Deep Learning","Global Level","Deep Learning Models","User Study","Visual Analysis","Latent Space","Embedding Space","Conceptual Space","Usage Scenarios","Left Panel","Design Process","Class Level","Category Level","Interactive System","ImageNet","System Usability","Mental Models","Ground Truth Labels","Design Goals","Forms Of Influence","Influential Concept","Common Concepts","Concept Extraction","Set Of Concepts","Central Panel","Local Explanations","Individual Concepts","Multi-class Analysis","Multivariate Classification Analysis","Think-aloud Protocols","Instance Predictions","Representative Prediction","Stripe Pattern","Conceptual Overlap"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209487","title":"Understanding Barriers to Network Exploration with Visualization: A Report from the Trenches","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":70,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Edinburgh, Scotland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089642359","id":37089642359,"full_name":"Mashael AlKadi","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Edinburgh, Scotland","Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Saudi Arabia"]}},{"affiliation":"Ramon Llull University, Spain","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087053534","id":37087053534,"full_name":"Vanessa Serrano","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Ramon Llull University, Spain"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Edinburgh, Scotland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087502231","id":37087502231,"full_name":"James Scott-Brown","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Edinburgh, Scotland"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283026800","id":37283026800,"full_name":"Catherine Plaisant","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland, USA","Inria, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407972900","id":37407972900,"full_name":"Jean-Daniel Fekete","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, France"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Edinburgh, Scotland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869968000","id":37869968000,"full_name":"Uta Hinrichs","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Edinburgh, Scotland"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Edinburgh, Scotland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085687578","id":37085687578,"full_name":"Benjamin Bach","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Edinburgh, Scotland"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"This article reports on an in-depth study that investigates barriers to network exploration with visualizations. Network visualization tools are becoming increasingly popular, but little is known about how analysts plan and engage in the visual exploration of network data—which exploration strategies they employ, and how they prepare their data, define questions, and decide on visual mappings. Our study involved a series of workshops, interaction logging, and observations from a 6-week network exploration course. Our findings shed light on the stages that define analysts' approaches to network visualization and barriers experienced by some analysts during their network visualization processes. These barriers mainly appear before using a specific tool and include defining exploration goals, identifying relevant network structures and abstractions, or creating appropriate visual mappings for their network data. Our findings inform future work in visualization education and analyst-centered network visualization tool design.","article_number":"9903291","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9903291","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903291/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903291/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"907","end_page":"917","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":499,"insert_date":"20220926","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Task analysis","Network analyzers","Training","Tutorials","Interviews"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Network Exploration","Network Visualization","Qualitative Study"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Logistics","Exploratory Data","Visual Network","Network Diagram","Visualization Tool","Exploration Strategy","Visual Exploration","Network Analysis","Data Format","Mitigation Strategies","Single Node","Visualization Techniques","Visual Patterns","Concept Mapping","Types Of Nodes","Preconceived Notions","Preconceived Ideas","Source Node","Part Of Course","Interactive Exploration","Multiple Links","Conceptual Domains","Link Weights","Visual Encoding","Lack Of Goals","Type Of Visualization","Visual Literacy","Goals Of The Course","Typical Pattern","Target Node","Data Preparation","Exploration Process"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209430","title":"ECoalVis: Visual Analysis of Control Strategies in Coal-fired Power Plants","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":71,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656249","id":37088656249,"full_name":"Shuhan Liu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085887051","id":37085887051,"full_name":"Di Weng","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089640911","id":37089640911,"full_name":"Yuan Tian","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547598","id":37086547598,"full_name":"Zikun Deng","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"JD iCity, JD Technology, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089640603","id":37089640603,"full_name":"Haoran Xu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["JD iCity, JD Technology, Beijing, China","JD Intelligent Cities Research, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089642673","id":37089642673,"full_name":"Xiangyu Zhu","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"JD iCity, JD Technology, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641531","id":37089641531,"full_name":"Honglei Yin","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["JD iCity, JD Technology, Beijing, China","JD Intelligent Cities Research, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089642099","id":37089642099,"full_name":"Xianyuan Zhan","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","id":37407308300,"full_name":"Yingcai Wu","author_order":9,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Improving the efficiency of coal-fired power plants has numerous benefits. The control strategy is one of the major factors affecting such efficiency. However, due to the complex and dynamic environment inside the power plants, it is hard to extract and evaluate control strategies and their cascading impact across massive sensors. Existing manual and data-driven approaches cannot well support the analysis of control strategies because these approaches are time-consuming and do not scale with the complexity of the power plant systems. Three challenges were identified: a) interactive extraction of control strategies from large-scale dynamic sensor data, b) intuitive visual representation of cascading impact among the sensors in a complex power plant system, and c) time-lag-aware analysis of the impact of control strategies on electricity generation efficiency. By collaborating with energy domain experts, we addressed these challenges with ECoalVis, a novel interactive system for experts to visually analyze the control strategies of coal-fired power plants extracted from historical sensor data. The effectiveness of the proposed system is evaluated with two usage scenarios on a real-world historical dataset and received positive feedback from experts.","article_number":"9908527","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9908527","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9908527/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9908527/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"1091","end_page":"1101","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":887,"insert_date":"20221003","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Power generation","Sensors","Visual analytics","Time series analysis","Data visualization","Industries","Sensor systems"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Power plant visual analytics","energy data visualization","spatiotemporal visualization","smart factory"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Control Strategy","Control Scheme","Analysis Strategy","Visual Analysis","Power Plants","Coal Power","Coal-fired Power Plants","Coal Plants","Coal Power Plants","Coal-fired Plants","Analysis Of Control Strategies","Interactive","Sensor Data","Real-world Datasets","Real-world Data Sets","Domain Experts","Usage Scenarios","Time Series","Time-series","Time Lag","Time Series Data","Time-series Data","Visual System","Time Range","Multiple Sensors","User Requirements","Matching Strategy","Matching Scheme","Line Chart","Backward Analysis","Query Interface","Types Of Queries","Graph Layout","Graph Drawing","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Match Events","Breadth-first Search","Breadth First Search","Breadth-first","Power Generation Efficiency","Color Hue","Colour Hue","Related Time Series","Time-series Relationship"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209480","title":"Geo-Storylines: Integrating Maps into Storyline Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":72,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Université Paris-Saclay, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641307","id":37089641307,"full_name":"Golina Hulstein","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Université Paris-Saclay, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086048089","id":37086048089,"full_name":"Vanessa Peña-Araya","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267832500","id":37267832500,"full_name":"Anastasia Bezerianos","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, France"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Storyline visualizations are a powerful way to compactly visualize how the relationships between people evolve over time. Real-world relationships often also involve space, for example the cities that two political rivals visited together or alone over the years. By default, Storyline visualizations only show implicitly geospatial co-occurrence between people (drawn as lines), by bringing their lines together. Even the few designs that do explicitly show geographic locations only do so in abstract ways (e.g., annotations) and do not communicate geospatial information, such as the direction or extent of their political campains. We introduce Geo-Storylines, a collection of visualisation designs that integrate geospatial context into Storyline visualizations, using different strategies for compositing time and space. Our contribution is twofold. First, we present the results of a sketching workshop with 11 participants, that we used to derive a design space for integrating maps into Storylines. Second, by analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of the potential designs of the design space in terms of legibility and ability to scale to multiple relationships, we extract the three most promising: Time Glyphs, Coordinated Views, and Map Glyphs. We compare these three techniques first in a controlled study with 18 participants, under five different geospatial tasks and two maps of different complexity. We additionally collected informal feedback about their usefulness from domain experts in data journalism. Our results indicate that, as expected, detailed performance depends on the task. Nevertheless, Coordinated Views remain a highly effective and preferred technique across the board.","article_number":"9917516","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9917516","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9917516/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9917516/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"994","end_page":"1004","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":829,"insert_date":"20221013","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Geospatial analysis","Data visualization","Urban areas","Conferences","Layout","Trajectory","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Storyline visualization","geo-temporal data","maps","hypergraphs"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Time And Space","Spacetime","Domain Experts","Design Space","Data Journalism","Diary Data","Data-driven Journalism","Spatial Patterns","Spatiotemporal Patterns","Temporal Patterns","User Study","Movement Patterns","End Of Session","End Of Each Session","Representation Of Space","Third Dimension","Over Space","Hyperspace","Aspects Of The Data","Local News","Local Journalists","Geospatial Data","Related Entities","Main Trial","Entity Types","Split Time","Hypergraph","Scrolling","Promising Design","Self-reported Confidence","Expert Feedback","Aspects Of Space","Latin Square","Temporal Data","Interactive","Representative Time","Error Rate","2D Visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209422","title":"Thirty-Two Years of IEEE VIS: Authors, Fields of Study and Citations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":73,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641873","id":37089641873,"full_name":"Hongtao Hao","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089642700","id":37089642700,"full_name":"Yumian Cui","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089642654","id":37089642654,"full_name":"Zhengxiang Wang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086229639","id":37086229639,"full_name":"Yea-Seul Kim","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The IEEE VIS Conference (VIS) recently rebranded itself as a unified conference and officially positioned itself within the discipline of Data Science.

We also examined the citation flows from referenced papers (i.e., those referenced in VIS) to VIS, and from VIS to citing papers (i.e., those citing VIS). We found that VIS has been becoming increasingly popular and collaborative. The number of publications, of unique authors, and of participating countries have been steadily growing. Both cross-country collaborations, and collaborations between educational and non-educational affiliations, namely “cross-type collaborations”, are increasing. The dominance of the US is decreasing, and authors from China are now an important part of VIS. In terms of author affiliation types, VIS is increasingly dominated by authors from universities. We found that the topics, inspirations, and influences of VIS research is limited such that (1) VIS, and their referenced and citing papers largely fall into the Computer Science domain, and (2) citations flow mostly between the same set of subfields within Computer Science.

Most of these decomposition methods (such as Fourier transform or singular spectrum analysis) only provide interaction via pre- and post-processing, but no means to influence the core algorithm. A method that also belongs to this class is Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), a spectral decomposition method that extracts spatio-temporal patterns from data. In this paper, we incorporate frequency-based constraints into DMD for an adaptive decomposition that leads to user-controllable visualizations, allowing analysts to include their knowledge into the process. To accomplish this, we derive an equivalent reformulation of DMD that implicitly provides access to the eigenvalues (and therefore to the frequencies) identified by DMD. By utilizing a constrained minimization problem customized to DMD, we can guarantee the existence of desired frequencies by minimal changes to DMD. We complement this core approach by additional techniques for constrained DMD to facilitate explorative visualization and investigation of time series data. With several examples, we demonstrate the usefulness of constrained DMD and compare it to conventional frequency-based decomposition methods.","article_number":"9904965","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904965","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904965/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904965/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"182","end_page":"192","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1052,"insert_date":"20220928","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Time series analysis","Market research","Data visualization","Human in the loop","Heuristic algorithms","Minimization","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Dynamic Mode Decomposition","time series analysis","spectral decomposition","frequency-based constraints","human-in-the-loop"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Dynamic Mode Decomposition","Time Series","Time-series","Time Series Data","Time-series Data","Minimization Problem","Spectral Decomposition","Decomposition Of Data","Time Series Decomposition","Time-series Decomposition","Singular Spectrum Analysis","Dynamical","Time Delay","Temporal Evolution","Temporal Development","Time Series Analysis","Time-series Analysis","Time Complexity","Seasonal Patterns","Singular Value Decomposition","Similarity Matrix","Similarity Matrices","Direct Visualization","Eigenvectors Of Matrix","Complex Plane","Influence Of Components","Complex Conjugate Pairs","Multivariate Time Series","Multivariate Time-series","Univariate Time Series","Delay Parameter","External Knowledge","Linearly Independent","Interpretation Of Components","Scale Matrix","Scaling Matrices","Reasonable Way","Fluid Dynamics","User Perspective"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209452","title":"RASIPAM: Interactive Pattern Mining of Multivariate Event Sequences in Racket Sports","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":75,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088755868","id":37088755868,"full_name":"Jiang Wu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"MIT, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088559342","id":37088559342,"full_name":"Dongyu Liu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["MIT, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088750906","id":37088750906,"full_name":"Ziyang Guo","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","id":37407308300,"full_name":"Yingcai Wu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","Alibaba-Zhejiang University Joint Research Institute of Frontier Technologies, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Experts in racket sports like tennis and badminton use tactical analysis to gain insight into competitors' playing styles. Many data-driven methods apply pattern mining to racket sports data — which is often recorded as multivariate event sequences — to uncover sports tactics. However, tactics obtained in this way are often inconsistent with those deduced by experts through their domain knowledge, which can be confusing to those experts. This work introduces RASIPAM, a RAcket-Sports Interactive PAttern Mining system, which allows experts to incorporate their knowledge into data mining algorithms to discover meaningful tactics interactively. RASIPAM consists of a constraint-based pattern mining algorithm that responds to the analysis demands of experts: Experts provide suggestions for finding tactics in intuitive written language, and these suggestions are translated into constraints to run the algorithm. RASIPAM further introduces a tailored visual interface that allows experts to compare the new tactics with the original ones and decide whether to apply a given adjustment. This interactive workflow iteratively progresses until experts are satisfied with all tactics. We conduct a quantitative experiment to show that our algorithm supports real-time interaction. Two case studies in tennis and in badminton respectively, each involving two domain experts, are conducted to show the effectiveness and usefulness of the system.","article_number":"9906966","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9906966","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9906966/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9906966/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"940","end_page":"950","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":500,"insert_date":"20220930","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Sports","Data mining","Visual analytics","Games","Data visualization","Task analysis","Systems architecture"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Sports Analytics","Multivariate Event Sequence","Interactive Pattern Mining","Comparative Visual Design"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Pattern Mining","Racket Sports","Cognitive Domains","Domain Knowledge","Domain Experts","Data-driven Methods","Data-driven Method","Quantitative Experiments","Original Ones","Visual Interface","Interaction Analysis","Raw Sequencing","Natural Language","Visual Analysis","Analysis Tasks","Categorical Values","Local Constraints","Multivariate Pattern","Local Ones","Global Constraints","Ball Position","Projection Views","Minimum Description Length","Table Tennis","Similar Tactics","Sequential Pattern Mining","Itemset Mining","Sequence Mining","Main View","Data-driven Algorithms","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Specific Tactics"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209497","title":"Sporthesia: Augmenting Sports Videos Using Natural Language","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":76,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"John A.

Yet, creating augmented sports videos remains a challenging task, requiring considerable time and video editing skills. On the other hand, sports insights are often communicated using natural language, such as in commentaries, oral presentations, and articles, but usually lack visual cues. Thus, this work aims to facilitate the creation of augmented sports videos by enabling analysts to directly create visualizations embedded in videos using insights expressed in natural language. To achieve this goal, we propose a three-step approach – 1) detecting visualizable entities in the text, 2) mapping these entities into visualizations, and 3) scheduling these visualizations to play with the video – and analyzed 155 sports video clips and the accompanying commentaries for accomplishing these steps. Informed by our analysis, we have designed and implemented Sporthesia, a proof-of-concept system that takes racket-based sports videos and textual commentaries as the input and outputs augmented videos. We demonstrate Sporthesia's applicability in two exemplar scenarios, i.e., authoring augmented sports videos using text and augmenting historical sports videos based on auditory comments. A technical evaluation shows that Sporthesia achieves high accuracy (F1-score of 0.9) in detecting visualizable entities in the text. An expert evaluation with eight sports analysts suggests high utility, effectiveness, and satisfaction with our language-driven authoring method and provides insights for future improvement and opportunities.","article_number":"9911988","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9911988","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9911988/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9911988/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"918","end_page":"928","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":738,"insert_date":"20221005","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Videos","Sports","Data visualization","Visualization","Task analysis","Natural language processing","Electronic mail"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Augmented Sports Videos","Language-driven Authoring Tool","Video-based Visualization","Sports Visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Natural Language","Sports Video","Video Clips","Public Speaking","Oral Presentations","Public Speech","Guest Speakers","Evaluation Techniques","Expert Evaluation","Expert Ratings","Three-step Approach","Video Editing","Actual Scene","Semantic Similarity","Semantic Relatedness","Tracking Data","Specific Moment","Visual Content","Emotional Cues","Named Entity Recognition","Entity Extraction","Complex Sentences","Output Of Step","Creative Tasks","Table Tennis","Video Object","Piece Of Text","Questions In Mind","Semantic Units","Ball Trajectory","Direct Exploration","Video Events","Raw Video","Semantic Role","Ball Sports","Interesting Direction"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209348","title":"Evaluating the Use of Uncertainty Visualisations for Imputations of Data Missing At Random in Scatterplots","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":77,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Northwestern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089206798","id":37089206798,"full_name":"Abhraneel Sarma","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Adobe Research, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547434","id":37086547434,"full_name":"Shunan Guo","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Adobe Research, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Adobe Research, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085728980","id":37085728980,"full_name":"Jane Hoffswell","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Adobe Research, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Adobe Research, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085372098","id":37085372098,"full_name":"Ryan Rossi","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Adobe Research, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Adobe Research, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085829363","id":37085829363,"full_name":"Fan Du","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Adobe Research, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Adobe Research, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37287201000","id":37287201000,"full_name":"Eunyee Koh","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Adobe Research, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38529287400","id":38529287400,"full_name":"Matthew Kay","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Most real-world datasets contain missing values yet most exploratory data analysis (EDA) systems only support visualising data points with complete cases. This omission may potentially lead the user to biased analyses and insights. Imputation techniques can help estimate the value of a missing data point, but introduces additional uncertainty. In this work, we investigate the effects of visualising imputed values in charts using different ways of representing data imputations and imputation uncertainty—no imputation, mean, 95% confidence intervals, probability density plots, gradient intervals, and hypothetical outcome plots. We focus on scatterplots, which is a commonly used chart type, and conduct a crowdsourced study with 202 participants. We measure users' bias and precision in performing two tasks—estimating average and detecting trend—and their self-reported confidence in performing these tasks. Our results suggest that, when estimating averages, uncertainty representations may reduce bias but at the cost of decreasing precision. When estimating trend, only hypothetical outcome plots may lead to a small probability of reducing bias while increasing precision. Participants in every uncertainty representation were less certain about their response when compared to the baseline. The findings point towards potential trade-offs in using uncertainty encodings for datasets with a large number of missing values.

In addition to the traditional visual designs, such as stacked line graph, ThemeRiver, and pixel-based visualization, we introduce a new variant of ThemeRiver, called “dual-flux ThemeRiver”, which allows viewers to observe and measure the most popular prediction more easily than stacked line graph and ThemeRiver. Together with pixel-based visualization, dual-flux ThemeRiver plots can also assist in model-development workflows, in addition to annotating music using ensemble model predictions.","article_number":"9905423","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9905423","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9905423/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9905423/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"864","end_page":"874","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":562,"insert_date":"20220928","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Mood","Data visualization","Visualization","Predictive models","Data models","Machine learning","Uncertainty"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["time-series visualization","ensemble learning","music mood classification"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Ensemble Prediction","Music Mood","Machine Learning","Machine-learning","Machine Learning Models","Individual Models","Ensemble Model","Visualization Techniques","Line Graph","Composers","Visual Design","Popularity Prediction","Model Performance","Convolutional Neural Network","Public Opinion","Public Perception","Machine Learning Methods","Machine Learning Method","Rate Analysis","Evaluation Analysis","Machine Learning Techniques","Machine-learning Techniques","Interval Length","Interval Lengths","Ground Truth Labels","Train Machine Learning Models","Gradient Boosting Decision Tree","Tree Boosting","Gradient Tree Boosting","Train Machine Learning","Dominance Rules","Dominant Opinion","AdaBoost","Weighting Scheme","Weighting Strategy","Music Perception","Musical Knowledge","Music Cognition","Musical Score","Deep Forest","Rule Changes","Opinion Change"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209467","title":"How Do Viewers Synthesize Conflicting Information from Data Visualizations?","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":79,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Massachusetts Amherst, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089642775","id":37089642775,"full_name":"Prateek Mantri","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Massachusetts Amherst, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Stanford University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086546336","id":37086546336,"full_name":"Hariharan Subramonyam","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Stanford University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Michigan Ann Arbor, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089640383","id":37089640383,"full_name":"Audrey L.

Scientists and journalists often communicate these incremental findings to lay people through visualizations and text (e.g., the positive and negative effects of caffeine intake). Consequently, readers need to integrate diverse and contrasting evidence from multiple sources to form opinions or make decisions. However, the underlying mechanism for synthesizing information from multiple visualizations remains under-explored. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a series of four experiments ($\\mathrm{N}=1166$) in which participants synthesized empirical evidence from a pair of line charts presented sequentially. In Experiment 1, we administered a baseline condition with charts depicting no specific context where participants held no strong belief. To test for the generalizability, we introduced real-world scenarios to our visualizations in Experiment 2 and added accompanying text descriptions similar to online news articles or blog posts in Experiment 3. In all three experiments, we varied the relative direction and magnitude of line slopes within the chart pairs. We found that participants tended to weigh the positive slope more when the two charts depicted relationships in the opposite direction (e.g., one positive slope and one negative slope). Participants tended to weigh the less steep slope more when the two charts depicted relationships in the same direction (e.g., both positive). Through these experiments, we characterize participants' synthesis behaviors depending on the relationship between the information they viewed, contribute to theories describing underlying cognitive mechanisms in information synthesis, and describe design implications for data storytelling.","article_number":"9904476","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904476","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904476/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904476/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"1005","end_page":"1015","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":571,"insert_date":"20220927","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Electronic mail","Decision making","Uncertainty","Systematics","Information filters","Data models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Information theory","Information synthesis","Primacy effect","Attitude change","Conflicting information"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Visualization","Slope Of Line","Real-world Scenarios","Negative Slope","News Articles","Positive Slope","Line Chart","Quality Of Life","Triangulation","Visual Information","Water Use","Water-use","Personal Life","Personal Lives","Quality Of Evidence","Public Spending","Government Spending","Social Spending","Relative Estimates","Hypothetical Scenarios","Mental Models","Distance Metrics","Higher Slope","End Of The Survey","Experiment 2b","Experiment 2a","Text Box","Free-response Questions","Free Response Questions","Input Text","Confirmation Bias","Average Hours","Abscissa","Risks Of Participation","Crop Yield"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209481","title":"Self-Supervised Color-Concept Association via Image Colorization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":80,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Shenzhen University, Visual Computing Research Center, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102312","id":37087102312,"full_name":"Ruizhen Hu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shenzhen University, Visual Computing Research Center, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Shenzhen University, Visual Computing Research Center, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089640900","id":37089640900,"full_name":"Ziqi Ye","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shenzhen University, Visual Computing Research Center, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Shenzhen University, Visual Computing Research Center, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37080128400","id":37080128400,"full_name":"Bin Chen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shenzhen University, Visual Computing Research Center, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Carleton University, School of Computer Science, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101740","id":37087101740,"full_name":"Oliver van Kaick","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Carleton University, School of Computer Science, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"Shenzhen University, Visual Computing Research Center, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086110259","id":37086110259,"full_name":"Hui Huang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shenzhen University, Visual Computing Research Center, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The interpretation of colors in visualizations is facilitated when the assignments between colors and concepts in the visualizations match human's expectations, implying that the colors can be interpreted in a semantic manner. However, manually creating a dataset of suitable associations between colors and concepts for use in visualizations is costly, as such associations would have to be collected from humans for a large variety of concepts. To address the challenge of collecting this data, we introduce a method to extract color-concept associations automatically from a set of concept images. While the state-of-the-art method extracts associations from data with supervised learning, we developed a self-supervised method based on colorization that does not require the preparation of ground truth color-concept associations. Our key insight is that a set of images of a concept should be sufficient for learning color-concept associations, since humans also learn to associate colors to concepts mainly from past visual input. Thus, we propose to use an automatic colorization method to extract statistical models of the color-concept associations that appear in concept images. Specifically, we take a colorization model pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tune it on the set of images associated with a given concept, to predict pixel-wise probability distributions in Lab color space for the images. Then, we convert the predicted probability distributions into color ratings for a given color library and aggregate them for all the images of a concept to obtain the final color-concept associations. We evaluate our method using four different evaluation metrics and via a user study. Experiments show that, although the state-of-the-art method based on supervised learning with user-provided ratings is more effective at capturing relative associations, our self-supervised method obtains overall better results according to metrics like Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and Entropy Difference (ED), which are closer to human perception of color distributions.","article_number":"9904484","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904484","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904484/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904484/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"247","end_page":"256","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":619,"insert_date":"20220927","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image color analysis","Feature extraction","Probability distribution","Data mining","Semantics","Libraries","Aggregates"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Color-concept association","colorization","EMD"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Color Images","Colour Images","Supervised Learning","Supervised Classification","Supervised Machine Learning","User Study","Color Space","Colour Space","Color Components","Color Distribution","Colour Distribution","Earth Mover’s Distance","Earth Mover","Lab Color Space","Lab Colour Space","Predicted Probability Distribution","Search Engine","Searchable","Web Search","Grayscale","Greyscale","Gray Level","Mushroom","Strawberry","Natural Images","Steps Of Method","Color Map","Colour Map","Colormap","Image Retrieval","Image Search","Optimal Transport","Transportation Problem","Self-supervised Learning","Contrastive Learning","Color Palette","Colour Palette","User Choice","Color Assignment","Colour Assignment","Self-supervised Manner","Affinity Score","Rathore","Rathod","Extract Color","Final Color","Final Colour","Concept Of Image","Perceptual Measures"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209424","title":"Fiber Uncertainty Visualization for Bivariate Data With Parametric and Nonparametric Noise Models","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":81,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077916100","id":37077916100,"full_name":"Tushar M.

Specifically, we extend the state-of-the-art Gaussian models of uncertainty for bivariate data to other parametric distributions (e.g., uniform and Epanechnikov) and more general nonparametric probability distributions (e.g., histograms and kernel density estimation) and derive corresponding spatial probabilities of fibers. In our proposed framework, we leverage Green's theorem for closed-form computation of fiber probabilities when bivariate data are assumed to have independent parametric and nonparametric noise. Additionally, we present a nonparametric approach combined with numerical integration to study the positional probability of fibers when bivariate data are assumed to have correlated noise. For uncertainty analysis, we visualize the derived probability volumes for fibers via volume rendering and extracting level sets based on probability thresholds.

It is based on a unified force representation, which formulates most existing techniques as a combination of quotient-based forces that combine power functions of graph-theoretical and Euclidean distances. This representation enables us to compare the strengths and weaknesses of existing techniques, while facilitating the development of new methods. Based on this, we propose a new balanced stress model (BSM) that is able to layout graphs in superior quality. In addition, we introduce a universal augmented stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer that efficiently finds proper solutions for all layout techniques.

However, the understanding is challenging for novice data workers due to the variety of programming languages, functions, and parameters. Based on the observation that differences between input and output tables highly relate to the type of data transformation, we outline a design space including 103 characteristics to describe table differences. Then, we develop Comantics, a three-step pipeline that automatically detects the semantics of data transformation scripts. The first step focuses on the detection of table differences for each line of wrangling code. Second, we incorporate a characteristic-based component and a Siamese convolutional neural network-based component for the detection of transformation types. Third, we derive the parameters of each data transformation by employing a “slot filling” strategy. We design experiments to evaluate the performance of Comantics. Further, we assess its flexibility using three example applications in different domains.","article_number":"9904459","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904459","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904459/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904459/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"117","end_page":"127","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":459,"insert_date":"20220927","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Codes","Semantics","Pipelines","Data visualization","Programming","Debugging","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data Transformation","Semantic Inference","Program Understanding","Table Comparison"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Semantic Data","Data Wrangling","DataWrangler","Data Munging","Functional Diversity","Variety Of Functions","Programming Language","Data Transformation","Applicability Domain","Application Domains","Design Space","Debugging","Type Of Transformation","Output Table","Training Set","Convolutional Neural Network","Missing Values","Function Parameters","Changes In Characteristics","Changes In Features","Visual System","Set Of Characteristics","Features In Set","Objective Data","Contribution Of Components","Contribution Of Each Component","Space Transformation","Top-1 Accuracy","Type Inference","Type Of Reconstruction","Number Of Transformants","Multiple Columns","Jupyter Notebook","Model-based Inference","Parameter Inference","User-defined Value","Entire Pipeline","Semantic Vectors"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209367","title":"Probablement, Wahrscheinlich, Likely?

Yet the extent to which language impacts how we reason about data and visualizations remains unclear. In this paper, we explore the intersection of visualization and language through a cross-language study on estimative probability tasks with icon-array visualizations. Across Arabic, English, French, German, and Mandarin, $n=50$ participants per language both chose probability expressions — e.g. likely, probable — to describe icon-array visualizations (Vis-to-Expression), and drew icon-array visualizations to match a given expression (Expression-to-Vis). Results suggest that there is no clear one-to-one mapping of probability expressions and associated visual ranges between languages. Several translated expressions fell significantly above or below the range of the corresponding English expressions. Compared to other languages, French and German respondents appear to exhibit high levels of consistency between the visualizations they drew and the words they chose. Participants across languages used similar words when describing scenarios above 80% chance, with more variance in expressions targeting mid-range and lower values. We discuss how these results suggest potential differences in the expressiveness of language as it relates to visualization interpretation and design goals, as well as practical implications for translation efforts and future studies at the intersection of languages, culture, and visualization.

Existing approaches are based on a linearization of the domain or on feature tracking. Domain linearizations use space-filling curves to place all sample points into a 1D domain, thereby breaking up individual features. Feature tracking methods explicitly respect feature continuity in space and time, but generally neglect the data context in which those features live. We present a feature-based linearization of the spatial domain that keeps features together and preserves their context by involving all data samples. We use augmented merge trees to linearize the domain and show that our linearized function has the same merge tree as the original data. A greedy optimization scheme aligns the trees over time providing temporal continuity. This leads to a static 2D visualization with one temporal dimension, and all spatial dimensions compressed into one. We compare our method against other domain linearizations as well as feature-tracking approaches, and apply it to several real-world data sets.","article_number":"9903344","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9903344","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903344/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903344/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"1157","end_page":"1167","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":586,"insert_date":"20220926","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Optimization","Animation","Storms","Coherence","Transient analysis","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Scalar field visualization","augmented merge tree","pixel-based visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Temporal Function","Temporal Map","Treemap","Tree Map","Functional Tree","Performance Of Trees","Merging Algorithm","Merge Tree","Static Visualizations","Time And Space","Spacetime","Optimal Strategy","Optimal Scheme","Temporal Dimension","Time Dimension","Temporal Properties","Spatial Dimensions","Spatial Attributes","Feature Tracking","Feature-tracking","Time-dependent Field","Time Dependent Field","Time Step","Kinetic Data","Dynamic Data","Linear Method","Linear Methods","Point Cloud","Point Clouds","Cyclone","Subtree","None Of These Methods","None Of Methods","Binary Tree","Discrete Problem","Complex Topology","Temporal Coherence","Feature-based Methods","Feature-based Method","Joining Tree","Junction Tree","Tree-decomposition","Tree Decomposition","Video Encoding","Sublevel Set","Superlevel Sets","Simple Topology","3D Flow","Consecutive Time Steps","Consecutive Timesteps","Low-pressure Systems","Benzene Molecules"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209404","title":"Visual Analysis of Neural Architecture Spaces for Summarizing Design Principles","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":86,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"BNRist, Tsinghua University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088514945","id":37088514945,"full_name":"Jun Yuan","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["BNRist, Tsinghua University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077049000","id":37077049000,"full_name":"Mengchen Liu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"BNRist, Tsinghua University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089640873","id":37089640873,"full_name":"Fengyuan Tian","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["BNRist, Tsinghua University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"BNRist, Tsinghua University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406039100","id":37406039100,"full_name":"Shixia Liu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["BNRist, Tsinghua University, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Recent advances in artificial intelligence largely benefit from better neural network architectures.

Students take on a client–real or simulated–a dataset, and a vague set of goals to create a complete visualization or visual analytics product. Unfortunately, many projects suffer from ambiguous goals, over or under-constrained client expectations, and data constraints that have students spending their time on non-visualization problems (e.g., data cleaning). These are important skills, but are often secondary course objectives, and unforeseen problems can majorly hinder students. We created an alternative for our information visualization course: Roboviz, a real-time game for students to play by building a visualization-focused interface. By designing the game mechanics around four different data types, the project allows students to create a wide array of interactive visualizations. Student teams play against their classmates with the objective to collect the most (good) robots. The flexibility of the strategies encourages variability, a range of approaches, and solving wicked design constraints. We describe the construction of this game and report on student projects over two years. We further show how the game mechanics can be extended or adapted to other game-based projects.","article_number":"9905748","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9905748","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9905748/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9905748/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"268","end_page":"277","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":438,"insert_date":"20220929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Games","Task analysis","Robots","Encoding","Conferences","Buildings"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["pedagogy","final project","game interfaces"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Information","Interactive Visualization","Student Projects","Final Project","Game Mechanics","Time Series","Time-series","Social Networks","Data Visualization","Time Series Data","Time-series Data","Visual System","Random Generation","Random Number Generator","Intrinsic Motivation","Extrinsic Motivation","Visual Network","Network Diagram","Learning Objectives","Gameplay","Game Play","Project Implementation","Tournament","Game Design","Good Design","Family Tree","Part Of The Robot","Project-based Learning","Traditional Project","Game Strategy","Project Communication","Use Of Interactions","Interactive Manipulation","True Answer","Entire Network","Engineering Courses","Technology Courses","Game Development"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209365","title":"KiriPhys: Exploring New Data Physicalization Opportunities","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":88,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Simon Fraser University, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089640456","id":37089640456,"full_name":"Foroozan Daneshzand","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Simon Fraser University, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Victoria, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077505300","id":37077505300,"full_name":"Charles Perin","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Victoria, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"Simon Fraser University, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37285000100","id":37285000100,"full_name":"Sheelagh Carpendale","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Simon Fraser University, Canada"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present KiriPhys, a new type of data physicalization based on kirigami, a traditional Japanese art form that uses paper-cutting.

A dual space coupling model is proposed in this paper to represent the complex bilateral relationship between data space and visual space theoretically and analytically. Under the guidance of the model, an overlap-free scatterplot method is developed through integration of the following: a geometry-based data transformation algorithm, namely DistributionTranscriptor; an efficient spatial mutual exclusion guided view transformation algorithm, namely PolarPacking; an overlap-free oriented visual encoding configuration model and a radius adjustment tool, namely $f_{r_{draw}}$. Our method can ensure complete and accurate information transfer between the two spaces, maintaining consistency between the newly created scatterplot and the original data distribution on global and local features.

However, a timelapse is limited to a single chosen temporal frequency, and often appears flickery due to aliasing. Also, the length of the timelapse video is directly tied to its temporal resolution, which necessitates tradeoffs between those two facets. In this paper, we propose Video Temporal Pyramids, a technique that addresses these limitations and expands the possibilities for visualizing the passage of time. Inspired by spatial image pyramids from computer vision, we developed an algorithm that builds video pyramids in the temporal domain. Each level of a Video Temporal Pyramid visualizes a different timescale; for instance, videos from the monthly timescale are usually good for visualizing seasonal changes, while videos from the one-minute timescale are best for visualizing sunrise or the movement of clouds across the sky. To help explore the different pyramid levels, we also propose a Video Spectrogram to visualize the amount of activity across the entire pyramid, providing a holistic overview of the scene dynamics and the ability to explore and discover phenomena across time and timescales. To demonstrate our approach, we have built Video Temporal Pyramids from ten outdoor scenes, each containing months or years of data. We compare Video Temporal Pyramid layers to naive timelapse and find that our pyramids enable alias-free viewing of longer-term changes. We also demonstrate that the Video Spectrogram facilitates exploration and discovery of phenomena across pyramid levels, by enabling both overview and detail-focused perspectives.","article_number":"9904493","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904493","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904493/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904493/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"171","end_page":"181","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":333,"insert_date":"20220927","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Spectrogram","Data visualization","Visualization","Streaming media","Real-time systems","Webcams","Time-frequency analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Time","time-frequency","video visualization","multi-scale","webcam"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Spectroscopic","Spectrogram","Computer Vision","Long-term Changes","Seasonal Changes","Meltwater","Ice Loss","Glacier Retreat","Temporal Frequency","Pyramidal Layer","Pyramid Layers","Time-lapse Video","Time Lapse Video","Pyramid Level","Image Pyramid","Image Pyramids","Heatmap","Spatial Resolution","Sampling Rate","Parallelization","Parallel Computing","Temporal Dimension","Time Dimension","Temporal Properties","Spatial Dimensions","Spatial Attributes","Frame Rate","Visualization Tool","Longer Time Scales","Longer Timescales","Laplacian Pyramid","Laplacian Pyramids","Sound Processor","Audio Processing","Scene Changes","Viewpoint Changes","Short Video","Corrupted Data","Worth Of Data","Range Of Time Scales","Range Of Timescales","Anomalous Events","Scene Elements"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209477","title":"LargeNetVis: Visual Exploration of Large Temporal Networks Based on Community Taxonomies","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":91,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Institute of Mathematics and Computer Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Carlos, Brazil","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088811523","id":37088811523,"full_name":"Claudio D.

Although these networks can be analyzed by different means, visual analytics stands out as an effective way for a pre-analysis before doing quantitative/statistical analyses to identify patterns, anomalies, and other behaviors in the data, thus leading to new insights and better decision-making. However, the large number of nodes, edges, and/or timestamps in many real-world networks may lead to polluted layouts that make the analysis inefficient or even infeasible. In this paper, we propose LargeNetVis, a web-based visual analytics system designed to assist in analyzing small and large temporal networks. It successfully achieves this goal by leveraging three taxonomies focused on network communities to guide the visual exploration process. The system is composed of four interactive visual components: the first (Taxonomy Matrix) presents a summary of the network characteristics, the second (Global View) gives an overview of the network evolution, the third (a node-link diagram) enables community- and node-level structural analysis, and the fourth (a Temporal Activity Map – TAM) shows the community- and node-level activity under a temporal perspective. We demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of LargeNetVis through two usage scenarios and a user study with 14 participants.","article_number":"9903295","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9903295","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903295/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903295/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"203","end_page":"213","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":659,"insert_date":"20220926","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Taxonomy","Layout","Animation","Stars","Visual analytics","Task analysis","Scalability"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["temporal networks","dynamic graphs","network visualization","visual scalability","community taxonomy"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Large Networks","Visual Exploration","Exploration Of Networks","Visual System","User Study","Community Networks","Global View","Web-based System","Real-world Networks","Usage Scenarios","Spatial Patterns","Spatiotemporal Patterns","Temporal Patterns","Exploratory Analysis","Exploratory Data Analysis","Community Structure","Interesting Feature","Interesting Characteristics","Identification Of Patterns","Visual Network","Network Diagram","Multiple-choice Questions","Multiple Choice Questions","Small Communities","Interest In Community","Node Positions","Location Of Nodes","Community Detection","Sexual Networks","Nodes In Community","Taxonomic Community","Presence Of Communities","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Group Of Nodes","Hypergraph","Local View","Community Detection Algorithm"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209361","title":"NAS-Navigator: Visual Steering for Explainable One-Shot Deep Neural Network Synthesis","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":92,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Visual Analytics and Imaging Lab, Stony Brook University, New York, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087502080","id":37087502080,"full_name":"Anjul Tyagi","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, Visual Analytics and Imaging Lab, Stony Brook University, New York, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Visual Analytics and Imaging Lab, Stony Brook University, New York, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085897527","id":37085897527,"full_name":"Cong Xie","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, Visual Analytics and Imaging Lab, Stony Brook University, New York, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Visual Analytics and Imaging Lab, Stony Brook University, New York, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273119700","id":37273119700,"full_name":"Klaus Mueller","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, Visual Analytics and Imaging Lab, Stony Brook University, New York, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The success of DL can be attributed to hours of parameter and architecture tuning by human experts. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) techniques aim to solve this problem by automating the search procedure for DNN architectures making it possible for non-experts to work with DNNs. Specifically, One-shot NAS techniques have recently gained popularity as they are known to reduce the search time for NAS techniques. One-Shot NAS works by training a large template network through parameter sharing which includes all the candidate NNs. This is followed by applying a procedure to rank its components through evaluating the possible candidate architectures chosen randomly. However, as these search models become increasingly powerful and diverse, they become harder to understand. Consequently, even though the search results work well, it is hard to identify search biases and control the search progression, hence a need for explainability and human-in-the-loop (HIL) One-Shot NAS. To alleviate these problems, we present NAS-Navigator, a visual analytics (VA) system aiming to solve three problems with One-Shot NAS; explainability, HIL design, and performance improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques. NAS-Navigator gives full control of NAS back in the hands of the users while still keeping the perks of automated search, thus assisting non-expert users. Analysts can use their domain knowledge aided by cues from the interface to guide the search. Evaluation results confirm the performance of our improved One-Shot NAS algorithm is comparable to other SOTA techniques. While adding Visual Analytics (VA) using NAS-Navigator shows further improvements in search time and performance. We designed our interface in collaboration with several deep learning researchers and evaluated NAS-Navigator through a control experiment and expert interviews.","article_number":"9904460","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904460","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904460/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904460/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"299","end_page":"309","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":391,"insert_date":"20220927","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Artificial neural networks","Computer architecture","Visual analytics","Deep learning","Training","Human in the loop","Search problems"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Deep Learning","Neural Network Architecture Search","Visual Analytics","Explainability"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Neural Network","Deep Learning","Cognitive Domains","Domain Knowledge","Search Results","Visual Analysis","Neural Architecture","Expert Interviews","Neural Architecture Search","Techniques Aim","Purpose Of This Technique","Non-expert Users","Deep Learning Research","User's Hand","Computer Vision","Feature Maps","Search Algorithm","User Study","Search Space","ImageNet","Domain Experts","Candidate Models","Fitness Score","Iterative Search","Final Architecture","Expert Users","Evolutionary Search","AlexNet","Validation Accuracy","Final Candidate","Template Design","Multiple Blocks"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209356","title":"Visual Analysis and Detection of Contrails in Aircraft Engine Simulations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":93,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Illinois at Chicago, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089184524","id":37089184524,"full_name":"Nafiul Nipu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Illinois at Chicago, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Illinois at Chicago, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089183519","id":37089183519,"full_name":"Carla Floricel","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Illinois at Chicago, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Illinois at Chicago, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089189100","id":37089189100,"full_name":"Negar Naghashzadeh","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Illinois at Chicago, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Illinois at Chicago, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089183763","id":37089183763,"full_name":"Roberto Paoli","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Illinois at Chicago, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Illinois at Chicago, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37937697100","id":37937697100,"full_name":"G.

We propose a visual computing system to assist in defining contrails and their characteristics, as well as in the analysis of parameters for computer-generated aircraft engine simulations. The back-end of our system leverages a contrail-formation criterion and clustering methods to detect contrails' shape and evolution and identify similar simulation runs.

Moreover, few studies have attempted to combine projection and ranking into the same exploration space to complement each other's strengths and weaknesses.

We explore the use of a robot arm with hand tracking to align tangible controls under the user's fingers as they reach out to interact with data affordances. We begin with a study evaluating the effectiveness of a robot-extended slider control compared to a large fixed physical slider and a purely virtual mid-air slider. We find that the robot slider has similar accuracy to the physical slider but is significantly more accurate than mid-air interaction. Further, the robot slider can be arbitrarily reoriented, opening up many new possibilities for tangible haptic interaction with immersive visualisations.

In this design study, we show how interactive visual exploration and analysis of high-dimensional, spectral data from noise simulation can facilitate design improvements in the context of conflicting criteria. Here, we focus on structure-borne noise, i.e., noise from vibrating mechanical parts. Detecting problematic noise sources early in the design and production process is essential for reducing a product's development costs and its time to market. In a close collaboration of visualization and automotive engineering, we designed a new, interactive approach to quickly identify and analyze critical noise sources, also contributing to an improved understanding of the analyzed system. Several carefully designed, interactive linked views enable the exploration of noises, vibrations, and harshness at multiple levels of detail, both in the frequency and spatial domain. This enables swift and smooth changes of perspective; selections in the frequency domain are immediately reflected in the spatial domain, and vice versa. Noise sources are quickly identified and shown in the context of their neighborhood, both in the frequency and spatial domain. We propose a novel drill-down view, especially tailored to noise data analysis. Split boxplots and synchronized 3D geometry views support comparison tasks. With this solution, engineers iterate over design optimizations much faster, while maintaining a good overview at each iteration.

Our approach uses local projection operators that map high-dimensional random vectors to low-dimensional space to formulate a generalized stress. In this way, our generic model supports arbitrary distributions and various stress types. We use our uncertainty-aware multidimensional scaling (UAMDS) concept to derive a formulation for the case of normally distributed random vectors and a squared stress. The resulting minimization problem is numerically solved via gradient descent. We complement UAMDS by additional visualization techniques that address the sensitivity and trustworthiness of dimensionality reduction under uncertainty. With several examples, we demonstrate the usefulness of our approach and the importance of uncertainty-aware techniques.","article_number":"9908526","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9908526","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9908526/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9908526/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"23","end_page":"32","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2262,"insert_date":"20221003","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty","Mathematical models","Data visualization","Dimensionality reduction","Stress","Probability density function","Probabilistic logic"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty visualization","dimensionality reduction","multidimensional scaling","non-linear projection"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Dimensionality Reduction","Minimization Problem","Random Vector","Low-dimensional Space","Lower-dimensional Space","Visualization Techniques","Projection Operator","Local Projects","Arbitrary Distribution","Uncertain Data","Normal Distribution","Gaussian Distribution","Mathematical Model","Supplemental Material","Probability Density Function","Sources Of Uncertainty","Multivariate Distribution","Projection Matrix","Matrix Operations","Projection Matrices","Distance Sampling","Affine Transformation","Stress Components","Subjective Performance","Linear Dimensionality Reduction","2D Space","Pair Distribution","Linear Projection","Different Levels Of Uncertainty","Local Linear","Joint Probability Density Function","Project Quality","Low-dimensional Vector","Dimensionality Reduction Methods","Dimensionality Reduction Method"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209445","title":"A Design Space for Surfacing Content Recommendations in Visual Analytic Platforms","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":98,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089643807","id":37089643807,"full_name":"Zhilan Zhou","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Information and Library Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086596233","id":37086596233,"full_name":"Wenyuan Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Information and Library Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Information and Library Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089645097","id":37089645097,"full_name":"Mengtian Guo","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Information and Library Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Information and Library Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087095531","id":37087095531,"full_name":"Yue Wang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Information and Library Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Information and Library Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601397400","id":37601397400,"full_name":"David Gotz","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Information and Library Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA","Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Recommendation algorithms have been leveraged in various ways within visualization systems to assist users as they perform of a range of information tasks.

Typical challenges include large data set sizes demanding for efficient rendering techniques as well as a large number of attributes that cannot be mapped simultaneously to the basic visual attributes provided by a tube-based visualization. In this work, we tackle both challenges with a new on-tube visualization approach. We improve recent work on high-quality GPU ray casting of Hermite spline tubes supporting ambient occlusion and extend it by a new layered procedural texturing technique. In the proposed framework, a large number of data set attributes can be mapped simultaneously to a variety of glyphs and plots that are embedded in texture space and organized in layers. Efficient rendering with minimal data transfer is achieved by generating the glyphs procedurally and drawing them in a deferred shading pass. We integrated these techniques in a prototype visualization tool that facilitates flexible mapping of data set attributes to visual tube and glyph attributes. We studied our approach on a variety of example data from different fields and found it to provide a highly adaptable and extensible toolbox to quickly craft tailor-made tube-based trajectory visualizations.","article_number":"9905624","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9905624","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9905624/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9905624/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"1288","end_page":"1298","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":588,"insert_date":"20220928","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Trajectory","Electron tubes","Visualization","Image color analysis","Rendering (computer graphics)","Geometry"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Rendering","Line Data","Trajectories","Multivariate Data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Multivariate Data","Multivariate Statistics","Trajectory Data","Multivariate Trajectories","Large Datasets","Large Data Sets","Diffusion Tensor Imaging","Diffusion-weighted Imaging","Diffusion Weighted Imaging","Diffusion Tensor","Cyber-physical Systems","Cyber Physical Systems","Ray Casting","Ray Shooting","Linear Interpolation","Bounding Box","Visual Methods","Visual Method","Domain Experts","Color Map","Colour Map","Colormap","Line Plots","Arc Length","Curve Length","Visual Map","Surface Parameters","Local Coordinate System","Tube Surface","Ray Tracing","Reference Grid","Signed Distance Function","Signed Distance Field","Fuel Flow","Texture Map","View Direction","Minimum Bounding Box","Axis-aligned Bounding Box","Parallel Coordinates","Tube Radius","Tube Radii","Graphical User Interface","Graphical Interface","Temporal Function","Temporal Map"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209482","title":"A Framework for Multiclass Contour Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":100,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Machine Perception, School of AI, Peking University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087099711","id":37087099711,"full_name":"Sihang Li","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Machine Perception, School of AI, Peking University, China","Center for Data Science, Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Peking University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Machine Perception, School of AI, Peking University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089416732","id":37089416732,"full_name":"Jiacheng Yu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Machine Perception, School of AI, Peking University, China","Center for Data Science, Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Peking University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Machine Perception, School of AI, Peking University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641725","id":37089641725,"full_name":"Mingxuan Li","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Machine Perception, School of AI, Peking University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641340","id":37089641340,"full_name":"Le Liu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Information Sciences and Technology, Pennsylvania State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547462","id":37086547462,"full_name":"Xiaolong Luke Zhang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Information Sciences and Technology, Pennsylvania State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Machine Perception, School of AI, Peking University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403856700","id":37403856700,"full_name":"Xiaoru Yuan","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Machine Perception, School of AI, Peking University, China","National Engineering Laboratory for Big Data Analysis and Application, Peking University, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Multiclass contour visualization is often used to interpret complex data attributes in such fields as weather forecasting, computational fluid dynamics, and artificial intelligence. However, effective and accurate representations of underlying data patterns and correlations can be challenging in multiclass contour visualization, primarily due to the inevitable visual cluttering and occlusions when the number of classes is significant. To address this issue, visualization design must carefully choose design parameters to make visualization more comprehensible. With this goal in mind, we proposed a framework for multiclass contour visualization. The framework has two components: a set of four visualization design parameters, which are developed based on an extensive review of literature on contour visualization, and a declarative domain-specific language (DSL) for creating multiclass contour rendering, which enables a fast exploration of those design parameters. A task-oriented user study was conducted to assess how those design parameters affect users' interpretations of real-world data. The study results offered some suggestions on the value choices of design parameters in multiclass contour visualization.","article_number":"9909991","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9909991","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9909991/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9909991/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"353","end_page":"362","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":608,"insert_date":"20221004","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Filling","DSL","Domain specific languages","Task analysis","Image color analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Contour","multiclass visualization","visualization framework","domain-specific language","visualization design"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Design Parameters","User Study","Choice Of Parameters","Visual Design","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Usability","Ease Of Use","Isothermal","Contour Plots","Linewidth","Line Width","Completion Time","Visual Methods","Visual Method","Classification Datasets","Peak Distribution","Task Accuracy","Extreme Points","Color Line","Colour Line","Pair Of Parameters","User Performance","Attribute Values","Task Completion Time","Alpha Matte","Alpha Maps","Alpha Blending","Alpha Channel","Fewer Lines","Different Choices Of Parameters","Visual Channels","Solid Color","Solid Colour","Tukey HSD","Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference","Accuracy Scores","Visual Parameters"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209359","title":"Photosensitive Accessibility for Interactive Data Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":101,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088658238","id":37088658238,"full_name":"Laura South","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017334100","id":38017334100,"full_name":"Michelle A.

Online data visualizations often incorporate elements of animation and interactivity to create a narrative, engage users, or encourage exploration. These design guidelines have been empirically validated by perceptual studies in visualization literature, but the impact of animation and interaction in visualizations on users with photosensitivity, who may experience seizures in response to certain visual stimuli, has not been considered. We systematically gathered and tested 1,132 interactive and animated visualizations for seizure-inducing risk using established methods and found that currently available methods for determining photosensitive risk are not reliable when evaluating interactive visualizations, as risk scores varied significantly based on the individual interacting with the visualization. To address this issue, we introduce a theoretical model defining the degree of control visualization designers have over three determinants of photosensitive risk in potentially seizure-inducing sequences: the size, frequency, and color of flashing content. Using an analysis of 375 visualizations hosted on bl.ocks.org, we created a theoretical model of photosensitive risk in visualizations by arranging the photosensitive risk determinants according to the degree of control visualization authors have over whether content exceeds photosensitive accessibility thresholds. We then use this model to propose a new method of testing for photosensitive risk that focuses on elements of visualizations that are subject to greater authorial control - and are therefore more robust to variations in the individual user - producing more reliable risk assessments than existing methods when applied to interactive visualizations.

However, label transfer by end-to-end computational methods is challenging due to the entanglement of technical (e.g., from different sequencing batches or techniques) and biological (e.g., from different cellular microenvironments) variations, only the first of which must be removed. To address this issue, we propose Polyphony, an interactive transfer learning (ITL) framework, to complement biologists' knowledge with advanced computational methods. Polyphony is motivated and guided by domain experts' needs for a controllable, interactive, and algorithm-assisted annotation process, identified through interviews with seven biologists. We introduce anchors, i.e., analogous cell populations across datasets, as a paradigm to explain the computational process and collect user feedback for model improvement. We further design a set of visualizations and interactions to empower users to add, delete, or modify anchors, resulting in refined cell type annotations. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through quantitative experiments, two hypothetical use cases, and interviews with two biologists. The results show that our anchor-based ITL method takes advantage of both human and machine intelligence in annotating massive single-cell datasets.","article_number":"9903604","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9903604","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903604/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903604/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"591","end_page":"601","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1215,"insert_date":"20220926","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Annotations","Biology","Biological system modeling","Cells (biology)","Statistics","Sociology"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Interactive Machine Learning","Transfer Learning","Single-cell Data Analysis","Human-AI Interaction"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Learning Framework","Transfer Learning","Single-cell Analysis","Single Cell Analysis","Single-cell Data","Single Cell Data","Interactive Learning","Transfer Learning Framework","Interactive Learning Framework","Cell Types","Cell-type","Cell Populations","Biologists","Biological Variation","Domain Experts","Quantitative Experiments","Human Intelligence","Single-cell Datasets","Single Cell Datasets","Single-cell Data Sets","Anchor-based Methods","Anchor-based Method","Design Process","Integration Process","Batch Effects","Visualization Tool","Query Dataset","Query Data Set","Query Set","Latent Space","Embedding Space","Accurate Annotation","Predicted Cell Type","Cell-type Prediction","Conditional Variational Autoencoder","Updated Model","Visual Design","Batch Effect Removal","Single-cell Transcriptomic Data","Single Cell Transcriptome Data"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209426","title":"Studying Early Decision Making with Progressive Bar Charts","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":103,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Washington, Seattle, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089640649","id":37089640649,"full_name":"Ameya Patil","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Washington, Seattle, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Inria & Université Paris-Saclay, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086929159","id":37086929159,"full_name":"Gaëlle Richer","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Inria & Université Paris-Saclay, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Rice University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294432200","id":37294432200,"full_name":"Christopher Jermaine","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Rice University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Carnegie Mellon University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085711170","id":37085711170,"full_name":"Dominik Moritz","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Inria & Université Paris-Saclay, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407972900","id":37407972900,"full_name":"Jean-Daniel Fekete","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Inria & Université Paris-Saclay, France"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We conduct a user study to quantify and compare user performance for a value comparison task using four bar chart designs, where the bars show the mean values of data loaded progressively and updated every second (progressive bar charts). Progressive visualization divides different stages of the visualization pipeline—data loading, processing, and visualization—into iterative animated steps to limit the latency when loading large amounts of data. An animated visualization appearing quickly, unfolding, and getting more accurate with time, enables users to make early decisions. However, intermediate mean estimates are computed only on partial data and may not have time to converge to the true means, potentially misleading users and resulting in incorrect decisions. To address this issue, we propose two new designs visualizing the history of values in progressive bar charts, in addition to the use of confidence intervals. We comparatively study four progressive bar chart designs: with/without confidence intervals, and using near-history representation with/without confidence intervals, on three realistic data distributions. We evaluate user performance based on the percentage of correct answers (accuracy), response time, and user confidence. Our results show that, overall, users can make early and accurate decisions with 92% accuracy using only 18% of the data, regardless of the design. We find that our proposed bar chart design with only near-history is comparable to bar charts with only confidence intervals in performance, and the qualitative feedback we received indicates a preference for designs with history.","article_number":"9904487","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904487","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904487/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904487/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"407","end_page":"417","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":562,"insert_date":"20220927","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Bars","Data visualization","Uncertainty","Decision making","History","Visualization","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Progressive visualization","Uncertainty","Bar charts","Confidence intervals"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Bar Charts","Early Decisions","Earlier Conclusion","Confidence Interval","Response Time","User Study","Iteration Step","True Mean","User Performance","Comparison Task","User Confidence","Error Bars","Power-law","Scaling Law","Power Law","Human Performance","Human Function","Visual Analysis","Real-world Data","Visual Task","Test Sequences","Decision Problem","Decision Procedure","Violin Plots","Normal Dataset","Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test","Response Time Task","Confidence Ratings","Latest Estimates","Confidence Interval CI","Average Response Time","Chart Types","Pre-specified Threshold","T-test Procedure","Steps Of Progression"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209491","title":"Measuring Effects of Spatial Visualization and Domain on Visualization Task Performance: A Comparative Study","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":104,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"King's College London, United Kingdom","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089642148","id":37089642148,"full_name":"Sara Tandon","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["King's College London, United Kingdom"]}},{"affiliation":"King's College London, United Kingdom","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489317800","id":38489317800,"full_name":"Alfie Abdul-Rahman","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["King's College London, United Kingdom"]}},{"affiliation":"King's College London, United Kingdom","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591074800","id":37591074800,"full_name":"Rita Borgo","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["King's College London, United Kingdom"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Understanding one's audience is foundational to creating high impact visualization designs. However, individual differences and cognitive abilities influence interactions with information visualization. Different user needs and abilities suggest that an individual's background could influence cognitive performance and interactions with visuals in a systematic way. This study builds on current research in domain-specific visualization and cognition to address if domain and spatial visualization ability combine to affect performance on information visualization tasks. We measure spatial visualization and visual task performance between those with tertiary education and professional profile in business, law & political science, and math & computer science. We conducted an online study with 90 participants using an established psychometric test to assess spatial visualization ability, and bar chart layouts rotated along Cartesian and polar coordinates to assess performance on spatially rotated data. Accuracy and response times varied with domain across chart types and task difficulty. We found that accuracy and time correlate with spatial visualization level, and education in math & computer science can indicate higher spatial visualization. Additionally, we found that motivational differences between domains could contribute to increased levels of accuracy. Our findings indicate discipline not only affects user needs and interactions with data visualization, but also cognitive traits. Our results can advance inclusive practices in visualization design and add to knowledge in domain-specific visual research that can empower designers across disciplines to create effective visualizations.","article_number":"9904456","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904456","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904456/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904456/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"668","end_page":"678","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":502,"insert_date":"20220927","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Task analysis","Education","Psychology","Bars","Time factors"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Human-subjects quantitative studies","visualization","perception","bar chart","discipline","domain-specific","education","empirical evaluation","spatial ability","cognitive abilities"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Task Performance","Visual Task","Spatial Visualization","Disciplines","Cognitive Function","Cognitive Performance","Cognitive Skills","Cognitive Abilities","Response Time","Data Visualization","Visual Information","Computer Science","Political Science","Political Studies","Vision Research","Bar Charts","Spatial Task","Visual Performance","Polar Coordinates","Spatial Ability","Visual Ability","Visual Design","Cognitive Traits","Easy Questions","Math Anxiety","Mathematics Anxiety","Visual Working","Hard Questions","Density Levels","Differences In Performance","Question Difficulty","Differences In Motivation","Visual Search","Visual Scanning","Educational Domain"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209439","title":"Multivariate Probabilistic Range Queries for Scalable Interactive 3D Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":105,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Visual Computing Center, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641855","id":37089641855,"full_name":"Amani Ageeli","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Visual Computing Center, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"]}},{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Visual Computing Center, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089640996","id":37089640996,"full_name":"Alberto Jaspe-Villanueva","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Visual Computing Center, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"]}},{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Visual Computing Center, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085349078","id":37085349078,"full_name":"Ronell Sicat","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Visual Computing Center, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"]}},{"affiliation":"Saudi Aramco, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38234535900","id":38234535900,"full_name":"Florian Mannuss","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Saudi Aramco, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"]}},{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Visual Computing Center, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37828701300","id":37828701300,"full_name":"Peter Rautek","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Visual Computing Center, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"]}},{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Visual Computing Center, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37394809600","id":37394809600,"full_name":"Markus Hadwiger","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Visual Computing Center, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Large-scale scientific data, such as weather and climate simulations, often comprise a large number of attributes for each data sample, like temperature, pressure, humidity, and many more. Interactive visualization and analysis require filtering according to any desired combination of attributes, in particular logical AND operations, which is challenging for large data and many attributes. Many general data structures for this problem are built for and scale with a fixed number of attributes, and scalability of joint queries with arbitrary attribute subsets remains a significant problem. We propose a flexible probabilistic framework for multivariate range queries that decouples all attribute dimensions via projection, allowing any subset of attributes to be queried with full efficiency. Moreover, our approach is output-sensitive, mainly scaling with the cardinality of the query result rather than with the input data size. This is particularly important for joint attribute queries, where the query output is usually much smaller than the whole data set. Additionally, our approach can split query evaluation between user interaction and rendering, achieving much better scalability for interactive visualization than the previous state of the art. Furthermore, even when a multi-resolution strategy is used for visualization, queries are jointly evaluated at the finest data granularity, because our framework does not limit query accuracy to a fixed spatial subdivision.","article_number":"9903339","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9903339","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903339/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903339/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"646","end_page":"656","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":407,"insert_date":"20220926","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Histograms","Probabilistic logic","Data structures","Rendering (computer graphics)","Query processing","Humidity"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["High-dimensional filtering","multivariate filtering","output-sensitivity","multivariate attribute queries","progressive culling"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Scalable","Interactive Visualization","Range Query","Data Structure","Cardinality","Set Size","Climate Models","Climate Simulations","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Query Results","False Positive","False-positive","False Negative","False-negative","Individual Cells","False Positive Rate","False-positive Rate","Cell Identity","Multivariate Data","Multivariate Statistics","Node Status","Lymph Node Status","Hash Function","Hash Table","Hash Value","Hash Codes","Leaf Node","Curse Of Dimensionality","Isosurface","Set Membership","Bloom Filter","Occupancy State","Range Bin","Binary Index","Bitmap Index","Bit Indices","Index Bits","Query Time","Spatial Hierarchy","OR Operation","Logical OR","Boolean OR","Separate Project","Intersection Set","Query Performance"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209413","title":"VDL-Surrogate: A View-Dependent Latent-based Model for Parameter Space Exploration of Ensemble Simulations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":106,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089374495","id":37089374495,"full_name":"Neng Shi","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086924444","id":37086924444,"full_name":"Jiayi Xu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100209","id":37087100209,"full_name":"Haoyu Li","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085681553","id":37085681553,"full_name":"Hanqi Guo","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory, Applied Computer Science Group (CCS-7), Los Alamos, NM, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37542815100","id":37542815100,"full_name":"Jonathan Woodring","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Los Alamos National Laboratory, Applied Computer Science Group (CCS-7), Los Alamos, NM, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279493500","id":37279493500,"full_name":"Han-Wei Shen","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We propose VDL-Surrogate, a view-dependent neural-network-latent-based surrogate model for parameter space exploration of ensemble simulations that allows high-resolution visualizations and user-specified visual mappings.

The axes ordering in PCP presents a particular story from the data based on the user perception of PCP polylines. Existing works focus on directly optimizing for PCP axes ordering based on some common analysis tasks like clustering, neighborhood, and correlation. However, direct optimization for PCP axes based on these common properties is restrictive because it does not account for multiple properties occurring between the axes, and for local properties that occur in small regions in the data. Also, many of these techniques do not support the human-in-the-loop (HIL) paradigm, which is crucial (i) for explainability and (ii) in cases where no single reordering scheme fits the users' goals. To alleviate these problems, we present PC-Expo, a real-time visual analytics framework for all-in-one PCP line pattern detection and axes reordering. We studied the connection of line patterns in PCPs with different data analysis tasks and datasets. PC-Expo expands prior work on PCP axes reordering by developing real-time, local detection schemes for the 12 most common analysis tasks (properties). Users can choose the story they want to present with PCPs by optimizing directly over their choice of properties. These properties can be ranked, or combined using individual weights, creating a custom optimization scheme for axes reordering. Users can control the granularity at which they want to work with their detection scheme in the data, allowing exploration of local regions. PC-Expo also supports HIL axes reordering via local-property visualization, which shows the regions of granular activity for every axis pair. Local-property visualization is helpful for PCP axes reordering based on multiple properties, when no single reordering scheme fits the user goals. A comprehensive evaluation was done with real users and diverse datasets confirm the efficacy of PC-Expo in data storytelling with PCPs.","article_number":"9904437","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904437","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904437/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904437/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"712","end_page":"722","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":392,"insert_date":"20220927","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Measurement","Optimization","Task analysis","Real-time systems","Data analysis","Correlation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["High dimensional data visualization","Parallel Coordinates Chart","Data Storytelling","Data Analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Parallel Coordinates","Optimal Strategy","Optimal Scheme","Regional Data","Commons Attribution","Collective Ownership","Common Property","Detection Scheme","Detection Strategies","Local Properties","Local Dimension","Line Patterns","Divergence","Local Level","Positive Feedback","Self-reinforcing","Data Visualization","User Study","Interactive System","Local Clustering","Properties Of Data","Data Attributes","Quality Metrics","Domain Experts","Neighboring Points","Neighborhood Of Point","Positive Skewness","High-dimensional Datasets","High-dimensional Data Sets","Points In Window","Local View","Secondary Axis","Traveling Salesman Problem","Primary Axis","Single Interface","Calculation Of Metrics","Computation Of Metrics","Global Optimization","Systematic Research"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209473","title":"Level Set Restricted Voronoi Tessellation for Large scale Spatial Statistical Analysis","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":108,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085904790","id":37085904790,"full_name":"Tyson Neuroth","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Sandia National Laboratories, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086280073","id":37086280073,"full_name":"Martin Rieth","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sandia National Laboratories, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"India Institute of Science, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086266578","id":37086266578,"full_name":"Konduri Aditya","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["India Institute of Science, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Alabama, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641260","id":37089641260,"full_name":"Myoungkyu Lee","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Alabama, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Sandia National Laboratories, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37293022400","id":37293022400,"full_name":"Jacqueline H Chen","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sandia National Laboratories, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275869400","id":37275869400,"full_name":"Kwan-Liu Ma","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Spatial statistical analysis of multivariate volumetric data can be challenging due to scale, complexity, and occlusion.

Our plots produce more faithful data representations and reduce moiré effects. Their contour is based on a customized kernel frequency estimation to match the shape of the distribution of underlying data values. Previous nonlinear layouts introduce column-centric nonlinear scaling of dot diameters for visualization of high-dynamic-range data with high peaks. We provide a mathematical approach to convert that column-centric scaling to our smooth envelope shape. This formalism allows us to use linear, root, and logarithmic scaling to find ideal dot sizes. Our method iteratively relaxes the dot layout for more correct and aesthetically pleasing results. To achieve this, we modified Lloyd's algorithm with additional constraints and heuristics. We evaluate the layouts of relaxed dot plots against a previously existing nonlinear variant and show that our algorithm produces less error regarding the underlying data while establishing the blue noise property that works against moiré effects. Further, we analyze the readability of our relaxed plots in three crowd-sourced experiments. The results indicate that our proposed technique surpasses traditional dot plots.","article_number":"9904443","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904443","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904443/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904443/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"278","end_page":"287","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":850,"insert_date":"20220927","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Layout","Kernel","Shape","Frequency estimation","Histograms","Visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Dot plot","statistical graphics","Lloyd relaxation","layout","kernel frequency estimation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Dot Plots","Higher Peak","Frequency Estimation","High Dynamic Range","High-dynamic-range","Nonlinear Scaling","Data Distribution","Solid Line","Horizontal Line","Supplemental Material","Data Visualization","Correct Position","Position Error","Linear Plot","Voronoi Diagram","Voronoi Tessellation","Voronoi Cell","Local Frequency","Inner Limiting","Outer Limits","Number Of Dots","Unit Distance","Visualization Of Distribution","Function Of Height","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Dot Positions","Position Of Each Dot","Signed Distance Function","Signed Distance Field","Uncertain Data","Geometric Primitives","Graphical Primitives","Beeswarm","Linear Time","Least-squares","Least Squares Method","Dataset Size","Vertical Line","Frequency Distribution"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209374","title":"GRay: Ray Casting for Visualization and Interactive Data Exploration of Gaussian Mixture Models","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":110,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Friedrich Schiller University of Jena, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085527253","id":37085527253,"full_name":"Kai Lawonn","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Friedrich Schiller University of Jena, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Otto von Guericke University of Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085898826","id":37085898826,"full_name":"Monique Meuschke","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Otto von Guericke University of Magdeburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Friedrich Schiller University of Jena, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087099469","id":37087099469,"full_name":"Pepe Eulzer","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Friedrich Schiller University of Jena, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Friedrich Schiller University of Jena, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089642580","id":37089642580,"full_name":"Matthias Mitterreiter","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Friedrich Schiller University of Jena, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Friedrich Schiller University of Jena, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37325999500","id":37325999500,"full_name":"Joachim Giesen","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Friedrich Schiller University of Jena, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Friedrich-Alexander-Universitä t Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085416142","id":37085416142,"full_name":"Tobias Günther","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Friedrich-Alexander-Universitä t Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The Gaussian mixture model (GMM) describes the distribution of random variables from several different populations. GMMs have widespread applications in probability theory, statistics, machine learning for unsupervised cluster analysis and topic modeling, as well as in deep learning pipelines. So far, few efforts have been made to explore the underlying point distribution in combination with the GMMs, in particular when the data becomes high-dimensional and when the GMMs are composed of many Gaussians. We present an analysis tool comprising various GPU-based visualization techniques to explore such complex GMMs. To facilitate the exploration of high-dimensional data, we provide a novel navigation system to analyze the underlying data. Instead of projecting the data to 2D, we utilize interactive 3D views to better support users in understanding the spatial arrangements of the Gaussian distributions. The interactive system is composed of two parts: (1) raycasting-based views that visualize cluster memberships, spatial arrangements, and support the discovery of new modes. (2) overview visualizations that enable the comparison of Gaussians with each other, as well as small multiples of different choices of basis vectors. Users are supported in their exploration with customization tools and smooth camera navigations. Our tool was developed and assessed by five domain experts, and its usefulness was evaluated with 23 participants. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we identify interesting features in several data sets.","article_number":"9903677","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9903677","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903677/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903677/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"526","end_page":"536","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":493,"insert_date":"20220926","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Statistics","Gaussian mixture model","Task analysis","Visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Shape"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Scientific visualization","Gaussian mixture models","ray casting","volume visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive","Gaussian Mixture Model","Ray Casting","Ray Shooting","Machine Learning","Machine-learning","Vector-based","Basis Vectors","Spatial Arrangement","Cluster Membership","Visualization Techniques","High Probability","Years Of Experience","Covariance Matrix","Covariance Matrices","Eigenvectors","Positive Definite Matrix","Positive Definite Matrices","Symmetric Positive Definite","Positive-definite Matrix","Maximum Intensity Projection","Mean Vector","Line Plots","System Overview","Largest Eigenvalue","Part Of Cluster","Orthonormal Basis","Orthogonal Set","Kernel Computation","Kernel Calculation","Number Of Gaussians","Scatterplot Matrix","Scatter Plot Matrix","Scatterplot Matrices","Camera Position","Camera Locations","Spatial Understanding","Bezier Curve","Cubic Bézier","Bézier Curves","Visual Approach","Principal Component Plots","Bar Charts","Point Cloud","Point Clouds"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209434","title":"MedChemLens: An Interactive Visual Tool to Support Direction Selection in Interdisciplinary Experimental Research of Medicinal Chemistry","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":111,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641854","id":37089641854,"full_name":"Chuhan Shi","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641451","id":37089641451,"full_name":"Fei Nie","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089640834","id":37089640834,"full_name":"Yicheng Hu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Nanyang Technological University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641942","id":37089641942,"full_name":"Yige Xu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37292792700","id":37292792700,"full_name":"Lei Chen","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085504538","id":37085504538,"full_name":"Xiaojuan Ma","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37277981600","id":37277981600,"full_name":"Qiong Luo","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Interdisciplinary experimental science (e.g., medicinal chemistry) refers to the disciplines that integrate knowledge from different scientific backgrounds and involve experiments in the research process. Deciding “in what direction to proceed” is critical for the success of the research in such disciplines, since the time, money, and resource costs of the subsequent research steps depend largely on this decision. However, such a direction identification task is challenging in that researchers need to integrate information from large-scale, heterogeneous materials from all associated disciplines and summarize the related publications of which the core contributions are often showcased in diverse formats. The task also requires researchers to estimate the feasibility and potential in future experiments in the selected directions. In this work, we selected medicinal chemistry as a case and presented an interactive visual tool, MedChemLens, to assist medicinal chemists in choosing their intended directions of research. This task is also known as drug target (i.e., disease-linked proteins) selection. Given a candidate target name, MedChemLens automatically extracts the molecular features of drug compounds from chemical papers and clinical trial records, organizes them based on the drug structures, and interactively visualizes factors concerning subsequent experiments. We evaluated MedChemLens through a within-subjects study (N=16). Compared with the control condition (i.e., unrestricted online search without using our tool), participants who only used MedChemLens reported faster search, better-informed selections, higher confidence in their selections, and lower cognitive load.","article_number":"9904486","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904486","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904486/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904486/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"63","end_page":"73","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":827,"insert_date":"20220927","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Drugs","Chemistry","Compounds","Visualization","Chemicals","Biomedical imaging","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Interdisciplinary experimental science","interactive visual analysis","scientific literature data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Medicinal Chemistry","Medicinal Properties","Visualization Tool","Interactive Tool","Interactive Visualization","Interactive Visualization Tool","Clinical Trials","Clinical Studies","Control Condition","Drug Targets","Molecular Characterization","Molecular Features","Research Process","Cognitive Load","Cognitive Demands","Mental Workload","Mental Effort","Target Selection","Candidate Target","Online Search","Characteristic Compounds","Features Of Compounds","Drug Compounds","Within-subject Study","Interdisciplinary Science","Target Name","Signaling Pathway","Signalling Pathway","Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase","Years Of Research Experience","Years Of Experience","Clinical Pharmacists","Clinical Pharmacy","Chemistry Panel","Comprehensive Metabolic Panel","Complete Metabolic Panel","Candidate Drug Targets","Future Drug Design","Digital Object Identifier","Publication Patterns"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209472","title":"A Scanner Deeply: Predicting Gaze Heatmaps on Visualizations Using Crowdsourced Eye Movement Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":112,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Maryland, College Park, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086291951","id":37086291951,"full_name":"Sungbok Shin","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Kakao Corp., South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089640423","id":37089640423,"full_name":"Sunghyo Chung","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Kakao Corp., South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Oregon State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641789","id":37089641789,"full_name":"Sanghyun Hong","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oregon State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland, College Park, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295438200","id":37295438200,"full_name":"Niklas Elmqvist","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Visual perception is a key component of data visualization. Much prior empirical work uses eye movement as a proxy to understand human visual perception. Diverse apparatus and techniques have been proposed to collect eye movements, but there is still no optimal approach. In this paper, we review 30 prior works for collecting eye movements based on three axes: (1) the tracker technology used to measure eye movements; (2) the image stimulus shown to participants; and (3) the collection methodology used to gather the data. Based on this taxonomy, we employ a webcam-based eyetracking approach using task-specific visualizations as the stimulus. The low technology requirement means that virtually anyone can participate, thus enabling us to collect data at large scale using crowdsourcing: approximately 12,000 samples in total. Choosing visualization images as stimulus means that the eye movements will be specific to perceptual tasks associated with visualization. We use these data to propose a Scanner Deeply, a virtual eyetracker model that, given an image of a visualization, generates a gaze heatmap for that image. We employ a computationally efficient, yet powerful convolutional neural network for our model. We compare the results of our work with results from the DVS model and a neural network trained on the Salicon dataset. The analysis of our gaze patterns enables us to understand how users grasp the structure of visualized data. We also make our stimulus dataset of visualization images available as part of this paper's contribution.","article_number":"9904490","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9904490","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904490/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9904490/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"396","end_page":"406","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":945,"insert_date":"20220927","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Predictive models","Crowdsourcing","Webcams","Visualization","Data models","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Gaze prediction","visualization","webcam-based eye-tracking","crowdsourcing","deep learning"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Eye Movements","Gaze Heatmap","Neural Network","Convolutional Neural Network","Visual Perception","Visual Images","Visual Inspection Of Images","Human Vision","Human Visual Perception","Stimulus Images","Image Stimuli","Gaze Patterns","Artificial Neural Network","Neural Network Model","Deep Neural Network","Laboratory Experiments","Computer Vision","Large-scale Datasets","Large-scale Data Sets","Cartographic","Natural Images","Bar Charts","Low-level Features","Crowdsourcing Platforms","Chart Types","Saliency Map","Pie Chart","Line Chart","Textual Information","Deep Neural Network Architecture","Eye-tracking Software","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209432","title":"ErgoExplorer: Interactive Ergonomic Risk Assessment from Video Collections","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":113,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Departamento de Ing.

The conventional risk assessment evaluation, based on expert-assisted observation of the workplaces and manually filling in score tables, is still predominant. Data analysis is usually done with a focus on critical moments, although without the support of contextual information and changes over time. In this paper we introduce ErgoExplorer, a system for the interactive visual analysis of risk assessment data. In contrast to the current practice, we focus on data that span across multiple actions and multiple workers while keeping all contextual information. Data is automatically extracted from video streams. Based on carefully investigated analysis tasks, we introduce new views and their corresponding interactions. These views also incorporate domain-specific score tables to guarantee an easy adoption by domain experts. All views are integrated into ErgoExplorer, which relies on coordinated multiple views to facilitate analysis through interaction. ErgoExplorer makes it possible for the first time to examine complex relationships between risk assessments of individual body parts over long sessions that span multiple operations. The newly introduced approach supports analysis and exploration at several levels of detail, ranging from a general overview, down to inspecting individual frames in the video stream, if necessary.

Reassembling the fragments of a broken object to restore its original state is the prerequisite of many analytical tasks such as cultural relics analysis and forensics reasoning. While existing computer-aided methods can automatically reassemble fragments, they often derive incorrect objects due to the complex and ambiguous fragment shapes. Thus, experts usually need to refine the object manually. Prior advances in immersive technologies provide benefits for realistic perception and direct interactions to visualize and interact with 3D fragments. However, few studies have investigated the reassembled object refinement. The specific challenges include: 1) the fragment combination set is too large to determine the correct matches, and 2) the geometry of the fragments is too complex to align them properly. To tackle the first challenge, PuzzleFixer leverages dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques, allowing users to review possible match categories, select the matches with reasonable shapes, and drill down to shapes to correct the corresponding faces. For the second challenge, PuzzleFixer embeds the object with node-link networks to augment the perception of match relations. Specifically, it instantly visualizes matches with graph edges and provides force feedback to facilitate the efficiency of alignment interactions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of PuzzleFixer, we conducted an expert evaluation based on two cases on real-world artifacts and collected feedback through post-study interviews. The results suggest that our system is suitable and efficient for experts to refine incorrect reassembled objects.","article_number":"9906965","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9906965","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9906965/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9906965/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"429","end_page":"439","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":845,"insert_date":"20220930","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three-dimensional displays","Visualization","Shape","Manuals","Faces","Optimization","Cultural differences"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Immersive visualization","interactive exploration","fragment reassembly","cultural heritage"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive","Direct Interaction","Dimensionality Reduction","Complex Shapes","Force Feedback","Haptic Device","Correct Matches","Immersive System","Cultural Relics","Target Group","Point Cloud","Visual Feedback","Video Feedback","Suggestions For Improvement","NP-hard Problem","Matching Score","Automatic Approach","Multiple Fragments","Immersive Environment","Exploration Stage","Shape Data","Pair Fragment","Pairwise Matching","Face Matching","Manual Alignment","Automatic Alignment","Automatic Techniques","Iterative Closest Point","Manual Refinement","Automatic Matching","Number Of Mismatches","Entire Object"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209403","title":"TrafficVis: Visualizing Organized Activity and Spatio-Temporal Patterns for Detecting and Labeling Human Trafficking","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":115,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Carnegie Mellon University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088892454","id":37088892454,"full_name":"Catalina Vajiac","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38276339400","id":38276339400,"full_name":"Duen Horng Chau","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Marinus Analytics, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641444","id":37089641444,"full_name":"Andreas Olligschlaeger","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Marinus Analytics, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Pittsburgh, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089640589","id":37089640589,"full_name":"Rebecca Mackenzie","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Pittsburgh, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"McGill MILA, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641287","id":37089641287,"full_name":"Pratheeksha Nair","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["McGill MILA, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"Carnegie Mellon University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088810811","id":37088810811,"full_name":"Meng-Chieh Lee","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"McGill MILA, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641059","id":37089641059,"full_name":"Yifei Li","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["McGill MILA, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"Carnegie Mellon University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086041447","id":37086041447,"full_name":"Namyong Park","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"McGill MILA, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089734072","id":37089734072,"full_name":"Reihaneh Rabbany","author_order":9,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["McGill MILA, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"Carnegie Mellon University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271732500","id":37271732500,"full_name":"Christos Faloutsos","author_order":10,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Law enforcement and domain experts can detect human trafficking (HT) in online escort websites by analyzing suspicious clusters of connected ads.

We build upon state-of-the-art text clustering algorithms by incorporating shared metadata as a signal of connected and possibly suspicious activity, then visualize the results. Domain experts can use TrafficVis to label clusters as HT, or other, suspicious, but non-HT activity such as spam and scam, quickly creating labeled datasets to enable further HT research. Through domain expert feedback and a usage scenario, we demonstrate TRAFFICVIS's efficacy. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with repeated high praises for the usability and explainability of our tool, the latter being vital for indicting possible criminals.","article_number":"9912645","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9912645","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9912645/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9912645/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"53","end_page":"62","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1055,"insert_date":"20221006","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Labeling","Task analysis","Law enforcement","Clustering algorithms","Metadata","Classification algorithms","Behavioral sciences"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Human trafficking","Labeling","Visualization","Infoshield"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Spatial Patterns","Spatiotemporal Patterns","Temporal Patterns","Organized Activities","Human Trafficking","Human Trade","Usability","Ease Of Use","Clustering Algorithm","Domain Experts","Usage Scenarios","Expert Feedback","Social Media","Social Platforms","Twitter","Retweets","Active Learning","Text Data","Text Corpus","Design Considerations","Big Picture","Geographical Spread","Modus Operandi","Spatiotemporal Data","Massage Parlors","Massage Parlours","Label Generation","Term Frequency-inverse Document Frequency","Inverse Document Frequency","TF-IDF","Manual Labeling","Labeling System","Cluster Labels","Labeling Process","Lesson Design","Mapping Panel","Extensive Feedback"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209412","title":"The State of the Art in BGP Visualization Tools: A Mapping of Visualization Techniques to Cyberattack Types","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":116,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089636288","id":37089636288,"full_name":"Justin Raynor","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37597152500","id":37597152500,"full_name":"Tarik Crnovrsanin","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088659466","id":37088659466,"full_name":"Sara Di Bartolomeo","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088658238","id":37088658238,"full_name":"Laura South","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087236804","id":37087236804,"full_name":"David Saffo","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38350716800","id":38350716800,"full_name":"Cody Dunne","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Internet routing is largely dependent on Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). However, BGP does not have any inherent authentication or integrity mechanisms that help make it secure. Effective security is challenging or infeasible to implement due to high costs, policy employment in these distributed systems, and unique routing behavior. Visualization tools provide an attractive alternative in lieu of traditional security approaches. Several BGP security visualization tools have been developed as a stop-gap in the face of ever-present BGP attacks. Even though the target users, tasks, and domain remain largely consistent across such tools, many diverse visualization designs have been proposed. The purpose of this study is to provide an initial formalization of methods and visualization techniques for BGP cybersecurity analysis. Using PRISMA guidelines, we provide a systematic review and survey of 29 BGP visualization tools with their tasks, implementation techniques, and attacks and anomalies that they were intended for. We focused on BGP visualization tools as the main inclusion criteria to best capture the visualization techniques used in this domain while excluding solely algorithmic solutions and other detection tools that do not involve user interaction or interpretation. We take the unique approach of connecting (1) the actual BGP attacks and anomalies used to validate existing tools with (2) the techniques employed to detect them. In this way, we contribute an analysis of which techniques can be used for each attack type. Furthermore, we can see the evolution of visualization solutions in this domain as new attack types are discovered. This systematic review provides the groundwork for future designers and researchers building visualization tools for providing BGP cybersecurity, including an understanding of the state-of-the-art in this space and an analysis of what techniques are appropriate for each attack type. Our novel security visualization survey methodology—connecting visualization techniques with appropriate attack types—may also assist future researchers conducting systematic reviews of security visualizations.

Modeling scientists conduct sensitivity analysis frequently to observe and monitor the behavior of a model during its development and deployment. The traditional algorithmic ranking of sensitivity of different parameters usually does not provide modeling scientists with sufficient information to understand the interactions between different parameters and model outputs, while modeling scientists need to observe a large number of model runs in order to gain actionable information for parameter optimization. To address the above challenge, we developed and compared two visual analytics approaches, namely: algorithm-centric and visualization-assisted, and visualization-centric and algorithm-assisted. We evaluated the two approaches based on a structured analysis of different tasks in visual sensitivity analysis as well as the feedback of domain experts. While the work was carried out in the context of epidemiological modeling, the two approaches developed in this work are directly applicable to a variety of modeling processes featuring time series outputs, and can be extended to work with models with other types of outputs.","article_number":"9906007","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9906007","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9906007/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9906007/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"1255","end_page":"1265","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":498,"insert_date":"20220929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Data models","Analytical models","Computational modeling","Uncertainty","Solid modeling","Numerical models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Sensitivity analysis","Ensemble visualization","COVID-19","Epidemiological Modeling","Epidemiology"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Sensitivity Analysis","Epidemiological Models","Pandemic","Time Series","Time-series","Computational Model","Parameter Sensitivity","Domain Experts","Visual Approach","Parameter Settings","Input Parameters","Parameter Space","Visualization Techniques","Visual Patterns","Simulation Run","Output Model","Yield Model","Scalar Value","Global Sensitivity","Local Sensitivity","Input Uncertainty","Ensemble Data","Scalar Output","Output Uncertainty","Yield Uncertainty","Time Series Clustering","Time-series Clustering","Function Of The Model Parameters","Clustering Of Lines","Clustering Output","Ensemble Analysis","Visual Encoding","Plot Of Values","Simulation Model"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209495","title":"The Influence of Visual Provenance Representations on Strategies in a Collaborative Hand-off Data Analysis Scenario","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":119,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Florida, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088635656","id":37088635656,"full_name":"Jeremy E.

Especially in intelligence analysis scenarios where different experts contribute knowledge to a shared understanding, members must communicate how insights develop to establish common ground among collaborators. The use of provenance to communicate analytic sensemaking carries promise by describing the interactions and summarizing the steps taken to reach insights. Yet, no universal guidelines exist for communicating provenance in different settings. Our work focuses on the presentation of provenance information and the resulting conclusions reached and strategies used by new analysts. In an open-ended, 30-minute, textual exploration scenario, we qualitatively compare how adding different types of provenance information (specifically data coverage and interaction history) affects analysts' confidence in conclusions developed, propensity to repeat work, filtering of data, identification of relevant information, and typical investigation strategies. We see that data coverage (i.e., what was interacted with) provides provenance information without limiting individual investigation freedom. On the other hand, while interaction history (i.e., when something was interacted with) does not significantly encourage more mimicry, it does take more time to comfortably understand, as represented by less confident conclusions and less relevant information-gathering behaviors. Our results contribute empirical data towards understanding how provenance summarizations can influence analysis behaviors.","article_number":"9903572","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9903572","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903572/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9903572/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9991003,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Jan. 2023","start_page":"1113","end_page":"1123","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":315,"insert_date":"20220926","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Collaboration","Visualization","History","Behavioral sciences","Data visualization","Task analysis","Data analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Analytic provenance","sensemaking","information transfer","visualization","workflow summarization","user studies"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Representation","Collaborative Analysis","Collaborative Data Analysis","Data Analysis Scenarios","Data-analysis Scenarios","Types Of Strategies","Typing Scheme","Cover Data","Analysis Tasks","Decision Confidence","Confident Conclusions","Data Analysis Tasks","Provenance Information","Interactive","Control Condition","Exploratory Analysis","Exploratory Data Analysis","Active Users","Degree Of Overlap","Degree Of Convergence","Visualization Tool","Information Gathering","Past Work","Prior Analysis","Representation Of Information","Instantaneous Information","Differences In Participants","User Performance","30-minute Sessions","Half-hour Sessions","Random Access","Analysis Of Textual Data","Limited Experience","Relative Depth","Relative Depths","Think-aloud Protocols","Collaborative Setting","Visual Design"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209419","title":"IDLat: An Importance-Driven Latent Generation Method for Scientific Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":120,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641667","id":37089641667,"full_name":"Jingyi Shen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100209","id":37087100209,"full_name":"Haoyu Li","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086924444","id":37086924444,"full_name":"Jiayi Xu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077194500","id":37077194500,"full_name":"Ayan Biswas","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279493500","id":37279493500,"full_name":"Han-Wei Shen","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Deep learning based latent representations have been widely used for numerous scientific visualization applications such as isosurface similarity analysis, volume rendering, flow field synthesis, and data reduction, just to name a few.

In this paper, we present a novel importance-driven latent representation to facilitate domain-interest-guided scientific data visualization and analysis. We utilize spatial importance maps to represent various scientific interests and take them as the input to a feature transformation network to guide latent generation. We further reduced the latent size by a lossless entropy encoding algorithm trained together with the autoencoder, improving the storage and memory efficiency. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of latent representations generated by our method with data from multiple scientific visualization
