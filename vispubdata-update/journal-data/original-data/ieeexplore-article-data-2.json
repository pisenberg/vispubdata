These workshops aim to teach students to explore visual design space for data by creating and discussing hand-drawn sketches. We describe the technical setup employed, the different parts of the workshop, how the actual sessions were run, and to what extent the remote version can substitute for in-person sessions. In general, the visual designs created by the students as well as the feedback provided by them indicate that the setup described here can be a feasible replacement for in-person visual design workshops.","article_number":"9551781","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9551781","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9551781/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9551781/","publication_title":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","publication_number":38,"is_number":9646502,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 Nov.-Dec. 2021","start_page":"15","end_page":"24","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":620,"insert_date":"20210928","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Data visualization","Education","Data science","Collaboration","Electronic learning","Distance learning"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Visualization","Visual Design","Data Visualization Design","Design Process","Design Space","Online Setting","In-person Sessions","Part Of The Workshop","Technical Setup","Technical Apparatuses","Technical Apparatus","Design Space Exploration","Purpose Of The Course","Aim Of The Course","Creativity","Creative Thinking","Growth Phase","Creative Process","Private Space","Personal Space","Communication Platforms","Co-teaching","Team Teaching","Project Group","Start Of Session","Start Of Each Session","Warm-up Exercises","Collaborative Platform","Groupware","Collaborative Tools","Teaching Assistants","Education Assistance","Interaction Design","Design Sessions","Part In Session","Aspects Of Creativity","Can Hear","Feedback Survey","Connectivity Issues"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2022.3176325","title":"Technology Trends and Challenges for Large-Scale Scientific Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"4","issn":"1558-1756","rank":2,"volume":"42","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory, NM, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282713700","id":37282713700,"full_name":"James Ahrens","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Los Alamos National Laboratory, NM, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Magazines","abstract":"Scientific visualization is a key approach to understanding the growing massive streams of data from scientific simulations and experiments.

These trends represent changes to the status quo and present the scientific visualization community with a new set of challenges. A major challenge involves extending our approaches to visualize the modern scientific process, which includes scientific verification and validation. Another key challenge to the community is the growing number, size, and complexity of scientific datasets.

Our method is designed to reconstruct high temporal resolution and high spatial resolution vector fields sequence from the corresponding low-resolution key frames. For large scale simulations, only data from a subset of time steps with reduced spatial resolution can be stored for post hoc analysis. In this article, we leverage a deep learning model to capture the nonlinear complex changes of vector field data with a two-stage architecture: the first stage deforms a pair of low spatial resolution (LSR) key frames forward and backward to generate the intermediate LSR frames, and the second stage performs spatial super-resolution to output the high-resolution sequence. Our method is scalable and can handle different datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework with several datasets through quantitative and qualitative evaluations.","article_number":"9488227","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9488227","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9488227/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9488227/","publication_title":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","publication_number":38,"is_number":9646502,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 Nov.-Dec. 2021","start_page":"122","end_page":"132","citing_paper_count":11,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":441,"insert_date":"20210716","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Deep learning","Magnetostatics","Magnetization","Space-time codes","Uniform resource locators","Vector quantization","Magnetic susceptibility"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Vector Field","Loss Function","Loss-of-function","Spatial Resolution","Deep Learning","Time Step","Detailed Characterization","Detailed Features","Temporal Dimension","Time Dimension","Temporal Properties","High-resolution Data","Linear Interpolation","Steady Flow","Unsteady Flow","Physical Simulation","Temporal Coherence","Key Frames","Pair Of Frames","Super-resolution Task","Intermediate Frames","Streamline","Scaling Factor","Grid Points","Jacobian Matrix","Jacobian Matrices","Peak Signal-to-noise Ratio Values","Peak Signal-to-noise Ratio","Peak Signal To Noise Ratio","PSNR","High-resolution Field","Motion Estimation","Scientific Visualization","Optical Flow","Cascade Structure","Motion Field","Flow Motion","Residual Block"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2021.3136545","title":"Finding Their Data Voice: Practices and Challenges of Dashboard Users","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"1558-1756","rank":5,"volume":"43","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, Portland, ME, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275861300","id":37275861300,"full_name":"Melanie Tory","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University, Portland, ME, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Simon Fraser University, Surrey, BC, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37353447100","id":37353447100,"full_name":"Lyn Bartram","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Simon Fraser University, Surrey, BC, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"Tableau Software, Seattle, WA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656119","id":37088656119,"full_name":"Brittany Fiore-Gartland","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tableau Software, Seattle, WA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Tableau Research, Seattle, WA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086615129","id":37086615129,"full_name":"Anamaria Crisan","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tableau Research, Seattle, WA, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Magazines","abstract":"Dashboards are the ubiquitous means of data communication within organizations. Yet we have limited understanding of how they factor into data practices in the workplace, particularly for data workers who do not self-identify as professional analysts. We focus on data workers who use dashboards as a primary interface to data, reporting on an interview study that characterizes their data practices and the accompanying barriers to seamless data interaction. While dashboards are typically designed for data consumption, our findings show that dashboard users have far more diverse needs. To capture these activities, we frame data workers’ practices as data conversations: conversations with data capture classic analysis (asking and answering data questions), while conversations through and around data involve constructing representations and narratives for sharing and communication. Dashboard users faced substantial barriers in their data conversations: their engagement with data was often intermittent, dependent on experts, and involved an awkward assembly of tools. We challenge the visualization and analytics community to embrace dashboard users as a population and design tools that blend seamlessly into their work contexts.","article_number":"9656613","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9656613","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9656613/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9656613/","publication_title":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","publication_number":38,"is_number":10035679,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"1 Jan.-Feb. 2023","start_page":"22","end_page":"36","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":658,"insert_date":"20211220","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Oral communication","Social factors","Documentation","Data visualization","Statistics","Design tools","Data communication"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Dashboard Users","Narrative","Interactive","Visual Representation","Active Users","Data Conversion","Conversational Data","Visual Design","Translation Work","Use Of Data","Spreadsheet","Analytical Tools","Direct Use","Direct Utilization","Direct Manipulation","Visualization Tool","Analytical Work","Variety Of Tools","Diverse Tools","Barriers To Entry","Market Barriers","Copy And Paste","Copy-and-paste","Service Requests","Artifacts In Data","Data Artefacts","Data Literacy","Construction Task","Deliberate Strategy"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2021.3115417","title":"What Students Learn With Personal Data Physicalization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"1558-1756","rank":6,"volume":"41","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077505300","id":37077505300,"full_name":"Charles Perin","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Magazines","abstract":"I describe the results of implementing a personal data physicalization assignment in an information visualization course for senior undergraduate and graduate students in computer science and software engineering.

However, it remains a challenging task since different layout methods tend to highlight different characteristics of the graphs. Recently, studies on deep-learning-based graph drawing algorithms have emerged but they are often not generalizable to arbitrary graphs without retraining. In this article, we propose a Convolutional-Graph-Neural-Network-based deep learning framework, DeepGD, which can draw arbitrary graphs once trained. It attempts to generate layouts by compromising among multiple prespecified aesthetics considering a good graph layout usually complies with multiple aesthetics simultaneously. In order to balance the tradeoff, we propose two adaptive training strategies, which adjust the weight factor of each aesthetic dynamically during training. The quantitative and qualitative assessment of DeepGD demonstrates that it is capable of drawing arbitrary graphs effectively, while being flexible at accommodating different aesthetic criteria.","article_number":"9476996","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9476996","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9476996/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9476996/","publication_title":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","publication_number":38,"is_number":9535317,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 Sept.-Oct. 2021","start_page":"32","end_page":"44","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":850,"insert_date":"20210707","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Layout","Measurement","Stress","Graph neural networks","Deep learning","Data models","Training data","Computer graphics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Deep Learning Framework","Graph Neural Networks","Graph Layout","Loss Function","Neural Network","Training Data","Convolutional Network","Convolutional Neural Network","General Framework","Weighting Factor","Training Strategy","Graph Structure","Edge Length","Minimum Angle","Graph Convolutional Network","Loss Of Components","Visual Properties","Training Adaptations","Edge Nodes","Graph Features","Pair Of Nodes","Edge Features","Residual Block","Directed Graph","Propagation Rule","Node Embeddings","Node Representations","Aggregation Function","Pareto Optimal","Visibility Graph"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2022.3157961","title":"Situated Visual Analysis and Live Monitoring for Manufacturing","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"1558-1756","rank":8,"volume":"42","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37689568100","id":37689568100,"full_name":"Michael Becher","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086559561","id":37086559561,"full_name":"Dominik Herr","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085654042","id":37085654042,"full_name":"Christoph Müller","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489885500","id":38489885500,"full_name":"Kuno Kurzhals","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37287276500","id":37287276500,"full_name":"Guido Reina","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Robert Bosch GmbH, Bühl, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089355700","id":37089355700,"full_name":"Lena Wagner","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Robert Bosch GmbH, Bühl, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268023800","id":37268023800,"full_name":"Thomas Ertl","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268045000","id":37268045000,"full_name":"Daniel Weiskopf","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Magazines","abstract":"Modern machines continuously log status reports over long periods of time, which are valuable data to optimize working routines.

We develop a visualization tool for hyperspectral images based on neural networks, which allows a user to specify the regions of interest, select bands of interest, and obtain hyperspectral classification results in a scatterplot generated from hyperspectral features. A cascade neural network is trained to generate a scatterplot that matches the cluster centers labeled by the user. The inferred scatterplot not only shows the clusters of points, but also reveals relationships of substances. The trained neural network can be reused for time-varying hyperspectral data analysis without retraining. Our visualization solution can keep domain experts in the analytical loop and provide an intuitive analysis of hyperspectral images while identifying different substances, which are difficult to be realized using existing hyperspectral image analysis techniques.","article_number":"9490338","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9490338","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9490338/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9490338/","publication_title":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","publication_number":38,"is_number":9535317,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 Sept.-Oct. 2021","start_page":"57","end_page":"66","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":500,"insert_date":"20210719","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Hyperspectral imaging","Neural networks","Image fusion","Software measurement","Image color analysis","Feature extraction"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Neural Network","Interactive Visualization","Visualization Of Hyperspectral Images","Botanical","Plant Biology","Botany","Black Box","Remote Sensing","Remote-sensing","Cluster Centers","Pseudocolor","False Color","False Colour","False-color","Domain Experts","Clusters Of Points","Bands Of Interest","Interactive Exploration","Band Selection","User Selection","Time-varying Data","Grassland","Prairie","Meadows","Steppe","Savanna","Convolutional Neural Network","Hidden Layer","Clustering Method","Clustering Methods","Linear Discriminant Analysis","Discriminant Function","Discriminant Function Analysis","Network Input","Interactive Tool","Uneven Illumination","Independent Component Analysis","Statistical Metrics","Bitumen","Bituminous","Original Hyperspectral Image","Neural Network Layers","Bare Soil","Value Of Image"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2021.3115396","title":"Activity Worksheets for Teaching and Learning Data Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"1558-1756","rank":11,"volume":"41","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086180930","id":37086180930,"full_name":"Vetria L.

However, due to the lack of reliable self-reported responses, service providers are troubled by the inadequate estimation of customer services and the tedious investigation into multimodal video recordings. We introduce Anchorage, a visual analytics system to evaluate customer satisfaction by summarizing multimodal behavioral features in customer service videos and revealing abnormal operations in the service process. We leverage the semantically meaningful operations to introduce structured event understanding into videos which help service providers quickly navigate to events of their interest. Anchorage supports a comprehensive evaluation of customer satisfaction from the service and operation levels and efficient analysis of customer behavioral dynamics via multifaceted visualization views. We extensively evaluate Anchorage through a case study and a carefully-designed user study. The results demonstrate its effectiveness and usability in assessing customer satisfaction using customer service videos. We found that introducing event contexts in assessing customer satisfaction can enhance its performance without compromising annotation precision. Our approach can be adapted in situations where unlabelled and unstructured videos are collected along with sequential records.","article_number":"10045801","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10045801","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10045801/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10045801/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4359476,"publication_year":2023,"start_page":"1","end_page":"13","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":168,"insert_date":"20230216","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Videos","Customer services","Behavioral sciences","Customer satisfaction","Visual analytics","Visualization","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Customer satisfaction","video data","video visualization","visual analytics"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3240003","title":"XNLI: Explaining and Diagnosing NLI-based Visual Data Analysis","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"99","issn":"2160-9306","rank":14,"volume":"PP","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"The State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/515260132793102","id":515260132793102,"full_name":"Yingchaojie Feng","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101987","id":37087101987,"full_name":"Xingbo Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"]}},{"affiliation":"The State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/853524548943826","id":853524548943826,"full_name":"Bo Pan","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656934","id":37088656934,"full_name":"Kam Kwai Wong","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"]}},{"affiliation":"The State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37090057620","id":37090057620,"full_name":"Yi Ren","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"]}},{"affiliation":"The State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/558386023678935","id":558386023678935,"full_name":"Shi Liu","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"]}},{"affiliation":"MIT Media Lab, Cambridge, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088858019","id":37088858019,"full_name":"Zihan Yan","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["MIT Media Lab, Cambridge, MA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Guangdong, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101494","id":37087101494,"full_name":"Yuxin Ma","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Guangdong, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":9,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Laboratory of Art and Archaeology Image (Zhejiang University), Ministry of Education, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37291847800","id":37291847800,"full_name":"Wei Chen","author_order":10,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Laboratory of Art and Archaeology Image (Zhejiang University), Ministry of Education, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Early Access Articles","abstract":"Natural language interfaces (NLIs) enable users to flexibly specify analytical intentions in data visualization.

Initially designed to represent and navigate through scientific publications in different disciplines, Cartolabe has evolved to become a generic framework and accommodate various corpora, ranging from Wikipedia (4.5M entries) to the French National Debate (4.3M entries). Cartolabe is made of two modules: The first relies on natural language processing methods, converting a corpus and its entities (documents, authors, and concepts) into high-dimensional vectors, computing their projection on the two-dimensional plane, and extracting meaningful labels for regions of the plane. The second module is a web-based visualization, displaying tiles computed from the multidimensional projection of the corpus using the Umap projection method. This visualization module aims at enabling users with no expertise in visualization and data analysis to get an overview of their corpus, and to interact with it: exploring, querying, filtering, panning, and zooming on regions of semantic interest. Three use cases are discussed to illustrate Cartolabe’s versatility and ability to bring large-scale textual corpus visualization and exploration to a wide audience.","article_number":"9238399","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9238399","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9238399/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9238399/","publication_title":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","publication_number":38,"is_number":9380849,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 March-April 2021","start_page":"76","end_page":"88","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":331,"insert_date":"20201023","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Two dimensional displays","Organizations","Task analysis","Filtering","Visualization","Natural language processing","Web services"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Scalable","Collection Of Papers","Document Collection","Web-based Visualization","Navigation","Semantic","Dimensionality Reduction","Contextual Information","Density Map","Scientific Publications","Information Retrieval","Interactive Visualization","Projection Method","Projection Methods","Filter Function","Sinc Function","Tens Of Millions","Entity Types","Software Framework","Graph Layout","Graph Drawing","Type Of Data Collection","Map For Each Subject","Topic Maps","Maps Of Subjects","Usability","Ease Of Use","Latent Dirichlet Allocation","Millions Of Points","Number Of Articles","Important Entities","Topic Modeling","Latent Space","Embedding Space","Word Embedding","Word Vectors","Search Box","Cluster Labels"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2021.3115413","title":"Visualization Design Sprints for Online and On-Campus Courses","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"1558-1756","rank":16,"volume":"41","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"John A.

A design sprint is a unique process based on rapid prototyping and user testing to define goals and validate ideas before starting costly development. The well-defined, interactive, and time-constrained design cycle makes design sprints a promising option for teaching project-based and active-learning-centered courses to increase student engagement and hands-on experience. Over the past five years, we have adjusted the design sprint methodology for teaching a range of visualization courses. We present a detailed guide on incorporating design sprints into large undergraduate and small professional development courses in both online and on-campus settings. Design sprint results, including quantitative and qualitative student feedback, show that design sprints engage students and help practice and apply visualization and design skills. We provide design sprint teaching materials, show examples of student-created work, and discuss limitations and lessons learned.","article_number":"9547834","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9547834","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9547834/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9547834/","publication_title":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","publication_number":38,"is_number":9646502,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 Nov.-Dec. 2021","start_page":"37","end_page":"47","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":456,"insert_date":"20210924","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Education","Visualization","User centered design","Electronic learning","Distance learning","Rapid prototyping"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Online Courses","Online Classes","Visual Design","On-campus Courses","Design Sprint","Prototype","Active Learning","Professional Education","Teaching Profession","Student Engagement","Online Teaching","Online Instruction","Online Education","User-centered","Human-centered Design","User-centered Design","Student Feedback","User Testing","Online Setting","Visual Skills","Student Projects","Project-based Learning","Visual Projection","Design Skills","Two-day Workshop","Team Members","Final Project","Breakout Rooms","Peer Feedback","Teaching Staff","Staff Education","Gestalt Principles","Gestalt Perception","Gestalt Theory","Gestalt Psychology","Length Of Course","Short Online","Class Time","Google Docs","End Of The Semester","End Of Each Semester"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2021.3115416","title":"A Didactic Framework for Analyzing Learning Activities to Design InfoVis Courses","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"1558-1756","rank":17,"volume":"41","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria, Campus Hagenberg, Hagenberg, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088222488","id":37088222488,"full_name":"Mandy Keck","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria, Campus Hagenberg, Hagenberg, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Applied Sciences Dresden, Dresden, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089188852","id":37089188852,"full_name":"Elena Stoll","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Applied Sciences Dresden, Dresden, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Applied Sciences Dresden, Dresden, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088225967","id":37088225967,"full_name":"Dietrich Kammer","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Applied Sciences Dresden, Dresden, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Magazines","abstract":"Data visualization is a powerful tool to cope with the demands of our current information age. In order to understand and be able to develop visualizations for specific use cases, data visualization activities (vis activities) have been proposed in recent years. These highly effective tools focus on practical relevance, reflection, and discussion in order to teach data visualization knowledge in a variety of contexts. However, the conscious selection of one or more vis activities for learners in comprehensive courses remains difficult. We aim to support this process by proposing a didactic vis framework. Based on Bloom's revised learning taxonomy, we decompose vis activities into distinct learning activities with their specific learning goals. By assigning the learning goals to the cognitive process and knowledge dimensions, a didactic course structure can be planned and evaluated. To demonstrate this didactic vis framework, we conducted several workshops based on an existing interface construction kit.","article_number":"9556143","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556143","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9556143/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9556143/","publication_title":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","publication_number":38,"is_number":9646502,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 Nov.-Dec. 2021","start_page":"80","end_page":"90","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":321,"insert_date":"20211001","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Cognitive processes","Educational courses","Education","Taxonomy","Complexity theory"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Active Learning","Cognitive Processes","Mental Processes","Data Visualization","Visual Information","Cognitive Dimensions","Knowledge Of Properties","Dimensions Of Knowledge","Key Tool","Interdisciplinary Collaboration","Dimensions Of Process","Cognitive Knowledge","Construction Kit","Visual Literacy","Building Blocks","Level Of Knowledge","Cognitive Level","Level Of Processing","Metacognitive","Design Space","Data Abstraction","Worksheet","Design Decisions","Activity Goals","Bloom’s Taxonomy","Construction Plan","Design Patterns","Structural Layout","Higher-order Thinking","Higher Order Thinking","Levels Of Dimensions","Visual Elements","Order Thinking","Thoughts In Order","GitHub Projects","Parallel Coordinates"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2021.3115387","title":"Through the Looking Glass: Insights Into Visualization Pedagogy Through Sentiment Analysis of Peer Review Text","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"1558-1756","rank":18,"volume":"41","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088396891","id":37088396891,"full_name":"Zachariah J.

We discuss opening the aperture, pushing back on what we, as a community, deem acceptable and rigorous, and what can be gained through greater inclusivity of approaches.","article_number":"9984051","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9984051","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9984051/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9984051/","publication_title":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","publication_number":38,"is_number":9984046,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 Nov.-Dec. 2022","start_page":"64","end_page":"71","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":292,"insert_date":"20221213","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Design methodology","Data visualization","Apertures","Problem-solving"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Disciplines","Variety Of Disciplines","Diverse Disciplines","Research Participants","Data Visualization","Research Process","Research Approach","Scientific Method","Scientific Methods","Mutual Respect","Examples Of Approaches","Visual Literacy","Narrative","Air Pollution","Natural Sciences","Domain Experts","Data In Way","Research Output","Understanding Of Use","Understanding Of Users","Distinct Contexts","Citizen Journalism","Participatory Journalism","Call For Papers"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2022.3155867","title":"Visual Parameter Space Analysis for Optimizing the Quality of Industrial Nonwovens","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"1558-1756","rank":24,"volume":"42","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer ITWM, Fraunhofer-Platz 1, Kaiserslautern, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089357048","id":37089357048,"full_name":"Viny Saajan Victor","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer ITWM, Fraunhofer-Platz 1, Kaiserslautern, Germany","TU Kaiserslautern, Postfach 3049, Kaiserslautern, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer ITWM, Fraunhofer-Platz 1, Kaiserslautern, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089356626","id":37089356626,"full_name":"Andre Schmeißer","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer ITWM, Fraunhofer-Platz 1, Kaiserslautern, Germany","Fraunhofer Center for Machine Learning, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Kaiserslautern, Postfach 3049, Kaiserslautern, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38488927600","id":38488927600,"full_name":"Heike Leitte","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Kaiserslautern, Postfach 3049, Kaiserslautern, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer ITWM, Fraunhofer-Platz 1, Kaiserslautern, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089354935","id":37089354935,"full_name":"Simone Gramsch","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer ITWM, Fraunhofer-Platz 1, Kaiserslautern, Germany","Frankfurt UAS, Nibelungenplatz 1, Frankfurt am Main, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Magazines","abstract":"Technical textiles, in particular, nonwovens used, for example, in medical masks, have become increasingly important in our daily lives.

Instead, tackling fairness must be inclusive and involve domain experts with specialized tools and workflows. Thus, domain-specific visualizations are needed for algorithmic fairness. Furthermore, while much work on AI fairness has focused on predictive decisions, less has been done for fair allocation and planning, which require human expertise and iterative design to integrate myriad constraints. We propose the Intelligible Fair Allocation (IF-Alloc) Framework that leverages explanations of causal attribution (Why), contrastive (Why Not) and counterfactual reasoning (What If, How To) to aid domain experts to assess and alleviate unfairness in allocation problems. We apply the framework to fair urban planning for designing cities that provide equal access to amenities and benefits for diverse resident types. Specifically, we propose an interactive visual tool, Intelligible Fair City Planner (IF-City), to help urban planners to perceive inequality across groups, identify and attribute sources of inequality, and mitigate inequality with automatic allocation simulations and constraint-satisfying recommendations (IF-Plan). We demonstrate and evaluate the usage and usefulness of IF-City on a real neighborhood in New York City, US, with practicing urban planners from multiple countries, and discuss generalizing our findings, application, and framework to other use cases and applications of fair allocation.","article_number":"10026242","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10026242","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10026242/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10026242/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4359476,"publication_year":2023,"start_page":"1","end_page":"18","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":292,"insert_date":"20230125","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Resource management","Visualization","Urban planning","Indexes","Data visualization","Buildings","Sociology"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Explainable artificial intelligence","fairness","intelligibility","resource allocation","urban planning"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2022.3149683","title":"Lessons Learned From Quantitatively Exploring Visualization Rubric Utilization for Peer Feedback","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"1558-1756","rank":28,"volume":"43","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088599339","id":37088599339,"full_name":"Daniel J.

To address this, current approaches are categorized into feature imputation and label prediction and are primarily focused on handling missing data to enhance ML performance. These approaches rely on the observed data to estimate the missing values and therefore encounter three main shortcomings in imputation, including the need for different imputation methods for various missing data mechanisms, heavy dependence on the assumption of data distribution, and potential introduction of bias. This study proposes a Contrastive Learning (CL) framework to model observed data with missing values, where the ML model learns the similarity between an incomplete sample and its complete counterpart and the dissimilarity between other samples. Our proposed approach demonstrates the advantages of CL without requiring any imputation. To enhance interpretability, we introduce CIVis, a visual analytics system that incorporates interpretable techniques to visualize the learning process and diagnose the model status. Users can leverage their domain knowledge through interactive sampling to identify negative and positive pairs in CL. The output of CIVis is an optimized model that takes specified features and predicts downstream tasks. We provide two usage scenarios in regression and classification tasks and conduct quantitative experiments, expert interviews, and a qualitative user study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. In short, this study offers a valuable contribution to addressing the challenges associated with ML modeling in the presence of missing data by providing a practical solution that achieves high predictive accuracy and model interpretability.","article_number":"10149378","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10149378","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10149378/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10149378/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4359476,"publication_year":2023,"start_page":"1","end_page":"18","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":297,"insert_date":"20230613","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data models","Predictive models","Training","Task analysis","Analytical models","Data visualization","Numerical models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Contrastive learning","data imputation","explainable AI","missing data"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3238821","title":"Force-Directed Graph Layouts Revisited: A New Force Based on the T-Distribution","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"99","issn":"2160-9306","rank":31,"volume":"PP","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Shandong University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089640826","id":37089640826,"full_name":"Fahai Zhong","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Shandong University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Shandong University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087103665","id":37087103665,"full_name":"Mingliang Xue","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Shandong University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Network Information Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38026660700","id":38026660700,"full_name":"Jian Zhang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Network Information Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Technology, SDTBU, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/908718954237391","id":908718954237391,"full_name":"Fan Zhang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, SDTBU, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Intelligent Network Design Institute, CITC, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/402110505570159","id":402110505570159,"full_name":"Rui Ban","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Intelligent Network Design Institute, CITC, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer and Information Science, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266781000","id":37266781000,"full_name":"Oliver Deussen","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer and Information Science, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Shandong University, China","full_name":"Yunhai Wang","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Shandong University, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Early Access Articles","abstract":"In this paper, we propose the t-FDP model, a force-directed placement method based on a novel bounded short-range force (t-force) defined by Student’s t-distribution.

Using such forces in force-directed graph layouts yields better neighborhood preservation than current methods, while maintaining low stress errors. Our efficient implementation using a Fast Fourier Transform is one order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art methods and two orders faster on the GPU, enabling us to perform parameter tuning by globally and locally adjusting the t-force in real-time for complex graphs.

In making sense of diverse information sources, dashboards have become an indispensable tool, providing fast, effective, adaptable, and personalized access to information for professionals and the general public alike. However, these objectives place heavy requirements on dashboards as information systems in usability and effective design. Understanding these issues is challenging given the absence of consistent and comprehensive approaches to dashboard evaluation. In this article we systematically review literature on dashboard implementation in healthcare, where dashboards have been employed widely, and where there is widespread interest for improving the current state of the art, and subsequently analyse approaches taken towards evaluation. We draw upon consolidated dashboard literature and our own observations to introduce a general definition of dashboards which is more relevant to current trends, together with seven evaluation scenarios - task performance, behaviour change, interaction workflow, perceived engagement, potential utility, algorithm performance and system implementation. These scenarios distinguish different evaluation purposes which we illustrate through measurements, example studies, and common challenges in evaluation study design. We provide a breakdown of each evaluation scenario, and highlight some of the more subtle questions. We demonstrate the use of the proposed framework by a design study guided by this framework. We conclude by comparing this framework with existing literature, outlining a number of active discussion points and a set of dashboard evaluation best practices for the academic, clinical and software development communities alike.","article_number":"9721816","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9721816","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9721816/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9721816/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9721431,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 April 2022","start_page":"1715","end_page":"1731","citing_paper_count":14,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2047,"insert_date":"20220225","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Refining","Medical services","Market research","Software","Usability","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","dashboard","evaluation","healthcare"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Behavior Change","Behaviour Change","Information System","Data System","Task Performance","Performance Of Algorithm","Information Overload","Evaluation Scenarios","Interactive","Evaluation Criteria","Evaluation Criterion","User Experience","User Groups","Time Complexity","Information Seeking","Information-seeking","Information Search","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Information Retrieval","Need For Information","Evaluation Framework","Visual Display","Iterative Design","Loop Design","Usage Intention","Secondary Task","Visual Literacy","Visual Design","Subjective Feedback","Individual Scenarios","Improve Task Performance","Information Systems Design","Spatial Trends","Typical Rate","Type Of Evaluation","Health Domains","Cognitive Load","Cognitive Demands","Mental Workload","Mental Effort"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3102051","title":"Outcome-Explorer: A Causality Guided Interactive Visual Interface for Interpretable Algorithmic Decision Making","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":34,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089574108","id":37089574108,"full_name":"Md Naimul Hoque","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA","College of Information Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273119700","id":37273119700,"full_name":"Klaus Mueller","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The widespread adoption of algorithmic decision-making systems has brought about the necessity to interpret the reasoning behind these decisions. The majority of these systems are complex black box models, and auxiliary models are often used to approximate and then explain their behavior. However, recent research suggests that such explanations are not overly accessible to lay users with no specific expertise in machine learning and this can lead to an incorrect interpretation of the underlying model. In this article, we show that a predictive and interactive model based on causality is inherently interpretable, does not require any auxiliary model, and allows both expert and non-expert users to understand the model comprehensively. To demonstrate our method we developed Outcome Explorer, a causality guided interactive interface, and evaluated it by conducting think-aloud sessions with three expert users and a user study with 18 non-expert users. All three expert users found our tool to be comprehensive in supporting their explanation needs while the non-expert users were able to understand the inner workings of a model easily.","article_number":"9507307","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9507307","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9507307/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9507307/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9930678,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 Dec. 2022","start_page":"4728","end_page":"4740","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":841,"insert_date":"20210804","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Predictive models","Artificial intelligence","Data models","Biological system modeling","Computational modeling","Machine learning","Decision making","Human computer interaction"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Explainable AI","causality","visual analytics","human-computer interaction"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Causality","Interfacial Interaction","Interactive Visualization","Decision-making Algorithm","Automated Decision","Automated Decision-making","Interactive Visualization Interface","Prediction Model","Machine Learning","Machine-learning","User Study","Expert Users","Non-expert Users","Auxiliary Model","Causal Relationship","Structural Equation Modeling","Magnitude Of Change","Input Features","Interactive System","Exogenous Variables","Endogenous Variables","Causal Model","General Data Protection Regulation","GDPR","Directed Acyclic Graph","Causal Structure","House Prices","Property Tax","Post-hoc Method","Post-hoc Methods","Bayesian Information Criterion Score","ML Models","Causal Analysis","Causal Network","Visual Design"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3285546","title":"The Reality of the Situation: A Survey of Situated Analytics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"99","issn":"2160-9306","rank":35,"volume":"PP","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086291951","id":37086291951,"full_name":"Sungbok Shin","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086246405","id":37086246405,"full_name":"Andrea Batch","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Bangor University, Bangor, U.K.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086303595","id":37086303595,"full_name":"Peter W.

However, little is known about how pictographs affect one’s ability to understand a visualization, beyond memory for values and trends. We conducted two crowdsourced experiments to compare the effectiveness of using pictographs when showing part-to-whole relationships. In Experiment 1, we compared pictograph arrays to more traditional bar and pie charts. We tested participants’ ability to generate high-level insights following Bloom’s taxonomy of educational objectives via 6 free-response questions. We found that accuracy for extracting information and generating insights did not differ overall between the two versions. To explore the motivating differences between the designs, we conducted a second experiment where participants compared charts containing pictograph arrays to more traditional charts on 5 metrics and explained their reasoning. We found that some participants preferred the way that pictographs allowed them to envision the topic more easily, while others preferred traditional bar and pie charts because they seem less cluttered and faster to read. These results suggest that, at least in simple visualizations depicting part-to-whole relationships, the choice of using pictographs has little influence on sensemaking and insight extraction. When deciding whether to use pictograph arrays, designers should consider visual appeal, perceived comprehension time, ease of envisioning the topic, and clutteredness.","article_number":"9465643","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9465643","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9465643/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9465643/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9930678,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 Dec. 2022","start_page":"4515","end_page":"4530","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":865,"insert_date":"20210625","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Taxonomy","Computer graphics","Encoding"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Infographics","pictographs","design","graph comprehension","understanding","casual sensemaking"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Bar Charts","Pie Chart","Bloom’s Taxonomy","Free-response Questions","Free Response Questions","Post Hoc Test","Post Hoc Analysis","Twitter","Retweets","Data Visualization","Linear Mixed-effects Models","Linear Mixed Effects Models","Cognitive Load","Cognitive Demands","Mental Workload","Mental Effort","Infographic","Graphical Display","Understanding Of Aspects","Perception Of The Importance","Latin Square","Visual Complexity","Processing Fluency","Perceptual Fluency","Cognitive Fluency","Solid Area","Kinds Of Animals","Kinds Of Creatures","Everyday Decisions","Familiar Topics","Familiar Themes","Familiar Subjects","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Severe COVID-19 Symptoms","Chart Types","Multicollinearity Analysis","Level Of Insight","Difference In Accuracy","Support For Hypothesis","Information In Ways","Differential Rates","Differentiation Rate","Evaluation Of Differences","Higher Levels Of Engagement"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3128157","title":"Explaining With Examples: Lessons Learned From Crowdsourced Introductory Description of Information Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"2160-9306","rank":37,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102860","id":37087102860,"full_name":"Leni Yang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102197","id":37087102197,"full_name":"Cindy Xiong","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641965","id":37089641965,"full_name":"Jason K.

This paper presents VISAtlas, an image-based approach empowered by neural image embedding, to facilitate exploration and query for visualization collections. To improve embedding accuracy, we create a comprehensive collection of synthetic and real-world visualizations, and use it to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model with a triplet loss for taxonomical classification of visualizations. Next, we design a coordinated multiple view (CMV) system that enables multi-perspective exploration and design retrieval based on visualization embeddings. Specifically, we design a novel embedding overview that leverages contextual layout framework to preserve the context of the embedding vectors with the associated visualization taxonomies, and density plot and sampling techniques to address the overdrawing problem. We demonstrate in three case studies and one user study the effectiveness of VISAtlas in supporting comparative analysis of visualization collections, exploration of composite visualizations, and image-based retrieval of visualization designs. The studies reveal that real-world visualization collections (e.g., Beagle and VIS30K) better accord with the richness and diversity of visualization designs than synthetic collections (e.g., Data2Vis), inspiring composite visualizations are identified in real-world collections, and distinct design patterns exist in visualizations from different sources.","article_number":"9984953","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9984953","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9984953/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9984953/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4359476,"publication_year":2022,"start_page":"1","end_page":"15","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":607,"insert_date":"20221214","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Feature extraction","Task analysis","Layout","Taxonomy","Semantics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization collection","image embedding","visual query","image visualization","design pattern"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3184993","title":"Visualization in Motion: A Research Agenda and Two Evaluations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"10","issn":"2160-9306","rank":39,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"CNRS, Inria, LISN, Université Paris-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089513363","id":37089513363,"full_name":"Lijie Yao","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["CNRS, Inria, LISN, Université Paris-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"]}},{"affiliation":"CNRS, Inria, LISN, Université Paris-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267832500","id":37267832500,"full_name":"Anastasia Bezerianos","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["CNRS, Inria, LISN, Université Paris-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"]}},{"affiliation":"ÉCole Centrale de Lyon, CNRS, UMR5205, LIRIS, Université de Lyon, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681739300","id":37681739300,"full_name":"Romain Vuillemot","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["ÉCole Centrale de Lyon, CNRS, UMR5205, LIRIS, Université de Lyon, France"]}},{"affiliation":"CNRS, Inria, LISN, Université Paris-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591317800","id":37591317800,"full_name":"Petra Isenberg","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["CNRS, Inria, LISN, Université Paris-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We contribute a research agenda for visualization in motion and two experiments to understand how well viewers can read data from moving visualizations.

The system allows users to conduct multi-level exploration of shortcuts. Specifically, Statistics View helps users grasp the statistics such as coverage and productivity of shortcuts in the benchmark dataset.

We conduct case studies and expert interviews to evaluate the effectiveness and usability of the system.

However, creating effective and elegant dashboards is challenging since it requires careful and logical arrangement and coordination of multiple visualizations. To solve the problem, we propose a data-driven approach for mining design rules from dashboards and automating dashboard organization. Specifically, we focus on two prominent aspects of the organization: arrangement, which describes the position, size, and layout of each view in the display space; and coordination, which indicates the interaction between pairwise views. We build a new dataset containing 854 dashboards crawled online, and develop feature engineering methods for describing the single views and view-wise relationships in terms of data, encoding, layout, and interactions. Further, we identify design rules among those features and develop a recommender for dashboard design. We demonstrate the usefulness of DMiner through an expert study and a user study. The expert study shows that our extracted design rules are reasonable and conform to the design practice of experts. Moreover, a comparative user study shows that our recommender could help automate dashboard organization and reach human-level performance. In summary, our work offers a promising starting point for design mining visualizations to build recommenders.","article_number":"10057994","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10057994","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10057994/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10057994/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4359476,"publication_year":2023,"start_page":"1","end_page":"15","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":443,"insert_date":"20230302","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Layout","Encoding","Feature extraction","Data mining","Visualization","Software development management"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Design Mining","Visualization Recommendation","Multiple-view Visualization","Dashboards"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3107749","title":"GEViTRec: Data Reconnaissance Through Recommendation Using a Domain-Specific Visualization Prevalence Design Space","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":42,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Tableau Research, Seattle, WA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086615129","id":37086615129,"full_name":"Anamaria Crisan","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tableau Research, Seattle, WA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089575434","id":37089575434,"full_name":"Shannah E.

Due to the volume and variety of data, it is challenging for genEpi domain experts to conduct data reconnaissance; that is, have an overview of the data they have and make assessments toward its quality, completeness, and suitability. We present an algorithm for data reconnaissance through automatic visualization recommendation, GEViTRec. Our approach handles a broad variety of dataset types and automatically generates visually coherent combinations of charts, in contrast to existing systems that primarily focus on singleton visual encodings of tabular datasets. We automatically detect linkages across multiple input datasets by analyzing non-numeric attribute fields, creating a data source graph within which we analyze and rank paths. For each high-ranking path, we specify chart combinations with positional and color alignments between shared fields, using a gradual binding approach to transform initial partial specifications of singleton charts to complete specifications that are aligned and oriented consistently. A novel aspect of our approach is its combination of domain-agnostic elements with domain-specific information that is captured through a domain-specific visualization prevalence design space. Our implementation is applied to both synthetic data and real Ebola outbreak data. We compare GEViTRec's output to what previous visualization recommendation systems would generate, and to manually crafted visualizations used by practitioners. We conducted formative evaluations with ten genEpi experts to assess the relevance and interpretability of our results.

In particular, confirmation bias can cause people to overweigh information that confirms their beliefs, and dismiss information that disconfirms them. We tested whether confirmation bias exists when people reason with visualized data and whether certain visualization designs can elicit less biased reasoning strategies. We asked crowdworkers to solve reasoning problems that had the potential to evoke both poor reasoning strategies and confirmation bias. We created two scenarios, one in which we primed people with a belief before asking them to make a decision, and another in which people held pre-existing beliefs. The data was presented as either a table, a bar table, or a bar chart. To correctly solve the problem, participants should use a complex reasoning strategy to compare two ratios, each between two pairs of values. But participants could also be tempted to use simpler, superficial heuristics, shortcuts, or biased strategies to reason about the problem. Presenting the data in a table format helped participants reason with the correct ratio strategy while showing the data as a bar table or a bar chart led participants towards incorrect heuristics. Confirmation bias was not significantly present when beliefs were primed, but it was present when beliefs were pre-existing. Additionally, the table presentation format was more likely to afford the ratio reasoning strategy, and the use of ratio strategy was more likely to lead to the correct answer. These findings suggest that data presentation formats can affect affordances for reasoning.","article_number":"10002893","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10002893","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10002893/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10002893/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4359476,"publication_year":2022,"start_page":"1","end_page":"13","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":317,"insert_date":"20221229","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Cognition","Urban areas","Bars","Skin","Affordances","Weapons"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Tabular displays","Empirical evaluation","Reasoning"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3171074","title":"Understanding How In-Visualization Provenance Can Support Trade-Off Analysis","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"9","issn":"2160-9306","rank":44,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"CNRS, INRIA, UMR MIA-Paris, AgroParisTech, INRAE, University Paris-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089930725","id":37089930725,"full_name":"Mehdi Chakhchoukh","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["CNRS, INRIA, UMR MIA-Paris, AgroParisTech, INRAE, University Paris-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"]}},{"affiliation":"UMR MIA-Paris, AgroParisTech, INRAE, University Paris-Saclay, Palaiseau, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37325862800","id":37325862800,"full_name":"Nadia Boukhelifa","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UMR MIA-Paris, AgroParisTech, INRAE, University Paris-Saclay, Palaiseau, France"]}},{"affiliation":"CNRS, INRIA, University Paris-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267832500","id":37267832500,"full_name":"Anastasia Bezerianos","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["CNRS, INRIA, University Paris-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In domains, such as agronomy or manufacturing, experts need to consider trade-offs when making decisions that involve several, often competing, objectives.

We implemented VisProm, a web-based trade-off analysis system, that incorporates in-visualization provenance views, designed to help experts keep track of trade-offs and their objectives. We used VisProm as a technology probe to understand user needs and explore the potential role of provenance in this context. Through observation sessions with three groups of experts analyzing their own data, we make the following contributions. We first, identify eight high-level tasks that experts engaged in during trade-off analysis, such as locating and characterizing interest zones in the trade-off space, and show how these tasks can be supported by provenance visualization. Second, we refine findings from previous work on provenance purposes such as recall and reproduce, by identifying specific objects of these purposes related to trade-off analysis, such as interest zones, and exploration structure (e.g., exploration of alternatives and branches). Third, we discuss insights on how the identified provenance objects and our designs support these trade-off analysis tasks, both when revisiting past analysis and while actively exploring. And finally, we identify new opportunities for provenance-driven trade-off analysis, for example related to monitoring the coverage of the trade-off space, and tracking alternative trade-off scenarios.","article_number":"9768153","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9768153","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9768153/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9768153/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10198498,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"1 Sept. 2023","start_page":"3758","end_page":"3774","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":376,"insert_date":"20220504","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Task analysis","Data visualization","History","Decision making","Probes","Optimization","Object recognition"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Decision making","multi-criteria","provenance","qualitative study","trade-offs","visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3229953","title":"Multilevel Visual Analysis of Aggregate Geo-Networks","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"99","issn":"2160-9306","rank":45,"volume":"PP","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547598","id":37086547598,"full_name":"Zikun Deng","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087274929","id":37087274929,"full_name":"Shifu Chen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Sport Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086448603","id":37086448603,"full_name":"Xiao Xie","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Sport Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085399384","id":37085399384,"full_name":"Guodao Sun","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer and Artificial Intelligence, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396970400","id":37396970400,"full_name":"Mingliang Xu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer and Artificial Intelligence, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China","Engineering Research Center of Intelligent Swarm Systems, MOE of China National Supercomputing Center in Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085887051","id":37085887051,"full_name":"Di Weng","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","id":37407308300,"full_name":"Yingcai Wu","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Early Access Articles","abstract":"Numerous patterns found in urban phenomena, such as air pollution and human mobility, can be characterized as many directed geospatial networks (geo-networks) that represent spreading processes in urban space. These geo-networks can be analyzed from multiple levels, ranging from the macro-level of summarizing all geo-networks, meso-level of comparing or summarizing parts of geo-networks, and micro-level of inspecting individual geo-networks. Most of the existing visualizations cannot support multilevel analysis well. These techniques work by: 1) showing geo-networks separately with multiple maps leads to heavy context switching costs between different maps; 2) summarizing all geo-networks into a single network can lead to the loss of individual information; 3) drawing all geo-networks onto one map might suffer from the visual scalability issue in distinguishing individual geo-networks. In this study, we propose GeoNetverse, a novel visualization technique for analyzing aggregate geo-networks from multiple levels. Inspired by metro maps, GeoNetverse balances the overview and details of the geo-networks by placing the edges shared between geo-networks in a stacked manner. To enhance the visual scalability, GeoNetverse incorporates a level-of-detail rendering, a progressive crossing minimization, and a coloring technique. A set of evaluations was conducted to evaluate GeoNetverse from multiple perspectives.","article_number":"9991899","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9991899","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9991899/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9991899/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4359476,"publication_year":2022,"start_page":"1","end_page":"16","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":272,"insert_date":"20221219","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Rendering (computer graphics)","Switches","Scalability","Minimization","Aggregates","Three-dimensional displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Geospatial network","multilevel analysis","information visualization","graph drawing"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3241581","title":"uxSense: Supporting User Experience Analysis with Visualization and Computer Vision","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"99","issn":"2160-9306","rank":46,"volume":"PP","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086246405","id":37086246405,"full_name":"Andrea Batch","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Waterloo, ON, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088969237","id":37088969237,"full_name":"Yipeng Ji","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Waterloo, ON, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085512472","id":37085512472,"full_name":"Mingming Fan","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Waterloo, ON, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38024987300","id":38024987300,"full_name":"Jian Zhao","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Waterloo, ON, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295438200","id":37295438200,"full_name":"Niklas Elmqvist","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Early Access Articles","abstract":"Analyzing user behavior from usability evaluation can be a challenging and time-consuming task, especially as the number of participants and the scale and complexity of the evaluation grows.

While common wisdom suggests that recontextualizing visualizations with metadata (e.g., disclosing the data source or instructions for decoding the visualizations' encoding) may counter these effects, the impact remains largely unknown. To fill this gap, we conducted two experiments. In Experiment 1, we explored how chart type, topic, and user goal impacted which categories of metadata participants deemed most relevant. We presented 64 participants with four real-world visualizations. For each visualization, participants were given four goals and selected the type of metadata they most wanted from a set of 18 types. Our results indicated that participants were most interested in metadata which explained the visualization's encoding for goals related to understanding and metadata about the source of the data for assessing trustworthiness. In Experiment 2, we explored how these two types of metadata impact transparency, trustworthiness and persuasiveness, information relevance, and understanding. We asked 144 participants to explain the main message of two pairs of visualizations (one with metadata and one without); rate them on scales of transparency and relevance; and then predict the likelihood that they were selected for a presentation to policymakers. Our results suggested that visualizations with metadata were perceived as more thorough than those without metadata, but similarly relevant, accurate, clear, and complete. Additionally, we found that metadata did not impact the accuracy of the information extracted from visualizations, but may have influenced which information participants remembered as important or interesting.","article_number":"9998319","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9998319","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9998319/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9998319/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4359476,"publication_year":2022,"start_page":"1","end_page":"16","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":314,"insert_date":"20221223","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Metadata","Encoding","Soft sensors","Stakeholders","Organizations","Data mining"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","metadata","understanding","transparency","trust"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3258440","title":"Analysis of Wildfire Visualization Systems for Research and Training: Are They up for the Challenge of the Current State of Wildfires?","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"99","issn":"2160-9306","rank":48,"volume":"PP","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"iCinema Research Centre, The University of New South Wales, Kensington, NSW, Australia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087319383","id":37087319383,"full_name":"Carlos A.

Furthermore, this change has rendered fire personnel training outdated and lost its ability to adequately prepare personnel to respond to these new fires. Immersive visualization can play a key role in tackling the growing issue of wildfires. Therefore, this survey reviews various studies that use immersive and non-immersive data visualization techniques to depict wildfire behavior and train first responders and planners.

Our approach produces high-fidelity neural representations with a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) exceeding 30 dB, while reducing their size by up to three orders of magnitude. Remarkably, we show that the entire training step can fit within a rendering loop, bypassing the need for pre-training. Additionally, we introduce an efficient out-of-core training strategy to support extreme-scale volume data, making it possible for our volumetric neural representation training to scale up to terascale on a workstation with an NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of training time, reconstruction quality, and rendering performance, making it an ideal choice for applications where fast and accurate visualization of large-scale volume data is paramount.","article_number":"10175377","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10175377","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10175377/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10175377/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4359476,"publication_year":2023,"start_page":"1","end_page":"14","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":330,"insert_date":"20230707","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Training","Encoding","Rendering (computer graphics)","Neural networks","Data visualization","Graphics processing units","Kernel"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Implicit neural representation","path tracing","ray marching","volume visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3241596","title":"A Qualitative Interview Study of Distributed Tracing Visualisation: A Characterisation of Challenges and Opportunities","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"99","issn":"2160-9306","rank":50,"volume":"PP","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, University of Saarland, Saarbrücken, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/317817103008990","id":317817103008990,"full_name":"Thomas Davidson","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, University of Saarland, Saarbrücken, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085898933","id":37085898933,"full_name":"Emily Wall","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, University of Saarland, Saarbrücken, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088602528","id":37088602528,"full_name":"Jonathan Mace","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, University of Saarland, Saarbrücken, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Early Access Articles","abstract":"Distributed tracing tools have emerged in recent years to enable operators of modern internet applications to troubleshoot cross-component problems in deployed applications. Due to the rich, detailed diagnostic data captured by distributed tracing tools, effectively presenting this data is important.

Consequently, operators struggle to make effective use of existing tools. In this paper we present the first characterisation of distributed tracing visualisation through a qualitative interview study with six practitioners from two large internet companies. Across two rounds of 1-on-1 interviews we use grounded theory coding to establish users, extract concrete use cases and identify shortcomings of existing distributed tracing tools. We derive guidelines for development of future distributed tracing tools and expose several open research problems that have wide reaching implications for visualisation research and other domains.","article_number":"10034850","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10034850","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10034850/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10034850/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4359476,"publication_year":2023,"start_page":"1","end_page":"12","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":334,"insert_date":"20230201","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Interviews","Distributed databases","Task analysis","Social networking (online)","Microservice architectures","Guidelines"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualisation","Distributed Tracing","Systems"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3263856","title":"RadVolViz: An Information Display-Inspired Transfer Function Editor for Multivariate Volume Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"99","issn":"2160-9306","rank":51,"volume":"PP","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086029140","id":37086029140,"full_name":"Ayush Kumar","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089933970","id":37089933970,"full_name":"Xinyu Zhang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Physics and Astronomy, UC Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/610825581465334","id":610825581465334,"full_name":"Huolin L.

Typically, volume density data are scalars which require simple 1D transfer functions to achieve this mapping. If the volume densities are vectors of three channels, one can straightforwardly map each channel to either red, green or blue, which requires a trivial extension of the 1D transfer function editor. We devise a new method that applies to volume data with more than three channels. These types of data often arise in scientific scanning applications, where the data are separated into spectral bands or chemical elements. Our method expands on prior work in which a multivariate information display, RadViz, was fused with a radial color map, in order to visualize multi-band 2D images. In this work, we extend this joint interface to blended volume rendering. The information display allows users to recognize the presence and value distribution of the multivariate voxels and the joint volume rendering display visualizes their spatial distribution. We design a set of operators and lenses that allow users to interactively control the mapping of the multivariate voxels to opacity and color. This enables users to isolate or emphasize volumetric structures with desired multivariate properties. Furthermore, it turns out that our method also enables more insightful displays even for RGB data. We demonstrate our method with three datasets obtained from spectral electron microscopy, high energy X-ray scanning, and atmospheric science.","article_number":"10091196","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10091196","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10091196/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10091196/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4359476,"publication_year":2023,"start_page":"1","end_page":"16","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":198,"insert_date":"20230403","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Transfer functions","Image color analysis","Data visualization","Rendering (computer graphics)","Batteries","Chemicals","Chemical elements"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Battery","color mapping","multi channel data","multivariate data","transfer function","volume rendering","volume visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3286392","title":"Creating Emordle: Animating Word Cloud for Emotion Expression","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"99","issn":"2160-9306","rank":52,"volume":"PP","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089364978","id":37089364978,"full_name":"Liwenhan Xie","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086245904","id":37086245904,"full_name":"Xinhuan Shu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/894151008797297","id":894151008797297,"full_name":"Jeon Cheol Su","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China","full_name":"Yun Wang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Data Science, Fudan University, Shanghai, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085387892","id":37085387892,"full_name":"Siming Chen","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Data Science, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Early Access Articles","abstract":"We propose emordle, a conceptual design that animates wordles (compact word clouds) to deliver their emotional context to audiences. To inform the design, we first reviewed online examples of animated texts and animated wordles, and summarized strategies for injecting emotion into the animations. We introduced a composite approach that extends an existing animation scheme for one word to multiple words in a wordle with two global factors: the randomness of text animation (entropy) and the animation speed (speed). To create an emordle, general users can choose one predefined animated scheme that matches the intended emotion class and fine-tune the emotion intensity with the two parameters. We designed proof-of-concept emordle examples for four basic emotion classes, namely happiness, sadness, anger, and fear. We conducted two controlled crowdsourcing studies to evaluate our approach. The first study confirmed that people generally agreed on the conveyed emotions from well-crafted animations, and the second one demonstrated that our identified factors helped fine-tune the extent of the emotion delivered. We also invited general users to create their own emordles based on our proposed framework. Through this user study, we confirmed the effectiveness of the approach. We concluded with implications for future research opportunities of supporting emotion expression in visualizations.","article_number":"10153659","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10153659","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10153659/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10153659/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4359476,"publication_year":2023,"start_page":"1","end_page":"14","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":237,"insert_date":"20230615","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Animation","Data visualization","Visualization","Videos","Tag clouds","Image color analysis","Entropy"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Wordle","Animation","Affective Visualization","Authoring","Casual Visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3225554","title":"GraphDecoder: Recovering Diverse Network Graphs from Visualization Images via Attention-Aware Learning","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"99","issn":"2160-9306","rank":53,"volume":"PP","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089823266","id":37089823266,"full_name":"Sicheng Song","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086945430","id":37086945430,"full_name":"Chenhui Li","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/955485354288378","id":955485354288378,"full_name":"Dong Li","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088563224","id":37088563224,"full_name":"Juntong Chen","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38008320400","id":38008320400,"full_name":"Changbo Wang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Early Access Articles","abstract":"DNGs are diverse network graphs with texts and different styles of nodes and edges, including mind maps, modeling graphs, and flowcharts. They are high-level visualizations that are easy for humans to understand but difficult for machines. Inspired by the process of human perception of graphs, we propose a method called GraphDecoder to extract data from raster images. Given a raster image, we extract the content based on a neural network. We built a semantic segmentation network based on U-Net. We increase the attention mechanism module, simplify the network model, and design a specific loss function to improve the model's ability to extract graph data. After this semantic segmentation network, we can extract the data of all nodes and edges. We then combine these data to obtain the topological relationship of the entire DNG. We also provide an interactive interface for users to redesign the DNGs. We verify the effectiveness of our method by evaluations and user studies on datasets collected on the Internet and generated datasets.","article_number":"9966829","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9966829","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9966829/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9966829/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4359476,"publication_year":2022,"start_page":"1","end_page":"17","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":291,"insert_date":"20221130","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data mining","Data visualization","Visualization","Bars","Image edge detection","Task analysis","Solids"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Information visualization","Chart mining","Semantic segmentation","Network graph","Attention mechanism"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3278304","title":"Towards Visualization Thumbnail Designs That Entice Reading Data-Driven Articles","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"99","issn":"2160-9306","rank":54,"volume":"PP","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"UNIST, Ulsan, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087126250","id":37087126250,"full_name":"Hwiyeon Kim","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UNIST, Ulsan, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"UNIST, Ulsan, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37090073896","id":37090073896,"full_name":"Joohee Kim","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UNIST, Ulsan, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"UNIST, Ulsan, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087125798","id":37087125798,"full_name":"Yunha Han","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UNIST, Ulsan, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089767355","id":37089767355,"full_name":"Hwajung Hong","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"UNIST, Ulsan, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086519103","id":37086519103,"full_name":"Oh-Sang Kwon","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UNIST, Ulsan, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"UNIST, Ulsan, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/227679203017829","id":227679203017829,"full_name":"Young-Woo Park","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UNIST, Ulsan, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295438200","id":37295438200,"full_name":"Niklas Elmqvist","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"UNIST, Ulsan, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088878128","id":37088878128,"full_name":"Sungahn Ko","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UNIST, Ulsan, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"IBM Research, Cambridge, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085677185","id":37085677185,"full_name":"Bum Chul Kwon","author_order":9,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IBM Research, Cambridge, MA, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Early Access Articles","abstract":"As online news increasingly include data journalism, there is a corresponding increase in the incorporation of visualization in article thumbnail images. However, little research exists on the design rationale for visualization thumbnails, such as resizing, cropping, simplifying, and embellishing charts that appear within the body of the associated article. Therefore, in this paper we aim to understand these design choices and determine what makes a visualization thumbnail inviting and interpretable. To this end, we first survey visualization thumbnails collected online and discuss visualization thumbnail practices with data journalists and news graphics designers. Based on the survey and discussion results, we then define a design space for visualization thumbnails and conduct a user study with four types of visualization thumbnails derived from the design space. The study results indicate that different chart components play different roles in attracting reader attention and enhancing reader understandability of the visualization thumbnails. We also find various thumbnail design strategies for effectively combining the charts' components, such as a data summary with highlights and data labels, and a visual legend with text labels and Human Recognizable Objects (HROs), into thumbnails. Ultimately, we distill our findings into design implications that allow effective visualization thumbnail designs for data-rich news articles. Our work can thus be seen as a first step toward providing structured guidance on how to design compelling thumbnails for data stories.","article_number":"10130316","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10130316","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10130316/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10130316/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4359476,"publication_year":2023,"start_page":"1","end_page":"16","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":247,"insert_date":"20230522","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Journalism","Visualization","Annotations","Surveys","Media","Videos"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data journalism","data stories","data-driven storytelling","online news","thumbnail images","visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3233548","title":"MitoVis: A Unified Visual Analytics System for End-to-End Neuronal Mitochondria Analysis","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"99","issn":"2160-9306","rank":55,"volume":"PP","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Korea University, Seoul, Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087129037","id":37087129037,"full_name":"JunYoung Choi","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Korea University, Seoul, Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Korea University, Seoul, Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089369559","id":37089369559,"full_name":"Hyun-Jic Oh","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Korea University, Seoul, Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Korea University, Seoul, Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086805767","id":37086805767,"full_name":"Hakjun Lee","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Korea University, Seoul, Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Korea University, Seoul, Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/308922219180413","id":308922219180413,"full_name":"Suyeon Kim","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Korea University, Seoul, Korea","Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089397840","id":37089397840,"full_name":"Seok-Kyu Kwon","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, Korea","University of Science and Technology, Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Korea University, Seoul, Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268212100","id":37268212100,"full_name":"Won-Ki Jeong","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Korea University, Seoul, Korea"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Early Access Articles","abstract":"Neurons have a polarized structure, with dendrites and axons, and compartment-specific functions can be affected by the dwelling mitochondria. Recent studies have shown that the morphology of mitochondria is closely related to the functions of neurons and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the conventional mitochondria analysis workflow mainly relies on manual annotations and generic image-processing software. Moreover, even though there have been recent developments in automatic mitochondria analysis using deep learning, the application of existing methods in a daily analysis remains challenging because the performance of a pretrained deep learning model can vary depending on the target data, and there are always errors in inference time, requiring human proofreading. To address these issues, we introduce MitoVis, a novel visualization system for end-to-end data processing and an interactive analysis of the morphology of neuronal mitochondria. MitoVis introduces a novel active learning framework based on recent contrastive learning, which allows accurate fine-tuning of the neural network model. MitoVis also provides novel visual guides for interactive proofreading so that users can quickly identify and correct errors in the result with minimal effort. We demonstrate the usefulness and efficacy of the system via case studies conducted by neuroscientists. The results show that MitoVis achieved up to 13.3× faster total analysis time in the case study compared to the conventional manual analysis workflow.","article_number":"10005035","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10005035","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10005035/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10005035/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4359476,"publication_year":2022,"start_page":"1","end_page":"15","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":265,"insert_date":"20230102","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Morphology","Neurons","Microscopy","Dendrites (neurons)","Deep learning","Axons"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Biomedical and medical visualization","intelligence analysis","machine learning","task and requirements analysis","user interfaces"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3251950","title":"Evaluating the Impact of Uncertainty Visualization on Model Reliance","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"99","issn":"2160-9306","rank":56,"volume":"PP","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Arizona State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087479636","id":37087479636,"full_name":"Jieqiong Zhao","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University, USA","full_name":"Yixuan Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088806671","id":37088806671,"full_name":"Michelle V.

However, to achieve the primary benefits of automating this part of decision-making, people must be able to trust the machine learning model's outputs. In order to enhance people's trust and promote appropriate reliance on the model, visualization techniques such as interactive model steering, performance analysis, model comparison, and uncertainty visualization have been proposed. In this study, we tested the effects of two uncertainty visualization techniques in a college admissions forecasting task, under two task difficulty levels, using Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform. Results show that (1) people's reliance on the model depends on the task difficulty and level of machine uncertainty and (2) ordinal forms of expressing model uncertainty are more likely to calibrate model usage behavior. These outcomes emphasize that reliance on decision support tools can depend on the cognitive accessibility of the visualization technique and perceptions of model performance and task difficulty.","article_number":"10058545","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10058545","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10058545/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10058545/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4359476,"publication_year":2023,"start_page":"1","end_page":"15","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":321,"insert_date":"20230303","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty","Predictive models","Task analysis","Data visualization","Data models","Computational modeling","Prediction algorithms"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty","model reliance","trust","human-machine collaborations"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3243676","title":"Visual Explanation for Open-domain Question Answering with BERT","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"99","issn":"2160-9306","rank":57,"volume":"PP","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Fudan University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/270083074846256","id":270083074846256,"full_name":"Zekai Shao","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fudan University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Fudan University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/823545362028275","id":823545362028275,"full_name":"Shuran Sun","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fudan University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Fudan University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37090071277","id":37090071277,"full_name":"Yuheng Zhao","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fudan University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Fudan University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089450033","id":37089450033,"full_name":"Siyuan Wang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fudan University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Fudan University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086267678","id":37086267678,"full_name":"Zhongyu Wei","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fudan University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Fudan University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089415580","id":37089415580,"full_name":"Tao Gui","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fudan University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Warwick, U.K.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37567685600","id":37567685600,"full_name":"Cagatay Turkay","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Warwick, U.K."]}},{"affiliation":"Fudan University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085387892","id":37085387892,"full_name":"Siming Chen","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fudan University, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Early Access Articles","abstract":"Open-domain question answering (OpenQA) is an essential but challenging task in natural language processing that aims to answer questions in natural language formats on the basis of large-scale unstructured passages.

However, as identified through our ongoing collaboration with domain experts and our review of literature, three key challenges limit their further improvement: (i) complex data with multiple long texts, (ii) complex model architecture with multiple modules, and (iii) semantically complex decision process. In this paper, we present VEQA, a visual analytics system that helps experts understand the decision reasons of OpenQA and provides insights into model improvement. The system summarizes the data flow within and between modules in the OpenQA model as the decision process takes place at the summary, instance and candidate levels. Specifically, it guides users through a summary visualization of dataset and module response to explore individual instances with a ranking visualization that incorporates context. Furthermore, VEQA supports fine-grained exploration of the decision flow within a single module through a comparative tree visualization.

Most of the existing methods and commercial applications for generating image collages are designed on simple shapes, such as rectangular and circular layouts. This greatly limits the use of image collages in some artistic and creative settings. Although there are some methods that can generate irregularly-shaped image collages, they often suffer from severe image overlapping and excessive blank space. This prevents such methods from being effective information communication tools. In this paper, we present a shape slicing algorithm and an optimization scheme that can create image collages of arbitrary shapes in an informative and visually pleasing manner given an input shape and an image collection. To overcome the challenge of irregular shapes, we propose a novel algorithm, called Shape-Aware Slicing, which partitions the input shape into cells based on medial axis and binary slicing tree. Shape-Aware Slicing, which is designed specifically for irregular shapes, takes human perception and shape structure into account to generate visually pleasing partitions. Then, the layout is optimized by analyzing input images with the goal of maximizing the total salient regions of the images. To evaluate our method, we conduct extensive experiments and compare our results against previous work. The evaluations show that our proposed algorithm can efficiently arrange image collections on irregular shapes and create visually superior results than prior work and existing commercial tools.","article_number":"10081386","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10081386","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10081386/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10081386/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4359476,"publication_year":2023,"start_page":"1","end_page":"13","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":174,"insert_date":"20230327","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Shape","Layout","Visualization","Optimization","Partitioning algorithms","Task analysis","Social networking (online)"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Image collection visualization","image collage","irregular shape layout"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3256376","title":"Interactive Subspace Cluster Analysis Guided by Semantic Attribute Associations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"99","issn":"2160-9306","rank":59,"volume":"PP","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, New York, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085900805","id":37085900805,"full_name":"Salman Mahmood","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, New York, NY, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, New York, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273119700","id":37273119700,"full_name":"Klaus Mueller","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, New York, NY, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Early Access Articles","abstract":"Multivariate datasets with many variables are increasingly common in many application areas. Most methods approach multivariate data from a singular perspective. Subspace analysis techniques, on the other hand. provide the user a set of subspaces which can be used to view the data from multiple perspectives. However, many subspace analysis methods produce a huge amount of subspaces, a number of which are usually redundant. The enormity of the number of subspaces can be overwhelming to analysts, making it difficult for them to find informative patterns in the data. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm that constructs semantically consistent subspaces. These subspaces can then be expanded into more general subspaces by ways of conventional techniques. Our framework uses the labels/meta-data of a dataset to learn the semantic meanings and associations of the attributes. We employ a neural network to learn a semantic word embedding of the attributes and then divide this attribute space into semantically consistent subspaces. The user is provided with a visual analytics interface that guides the analysis process. We show via various examples that these semantic subspaces can help organize the data and guide the user in finding interesting patterns in the dataset.","article_number":"10068257","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10068257","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10068257/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10068257/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4359476,"publication_year":2023,"start_page":"1","end_page":"13","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":226,"insert_date":"20230313","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Semantics","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Task analysis","Standards","Space exploration"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["High-dimensional data","multivariate data","subspace clustering","subspace analysis","cluster analysis"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3292391","title":"Investigating the Visual Utility of Differentially Private Scatterplots","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"99","issn":"2160-9306","rank":60,"volume":"PP","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/841709194627136","id":841709194627136,"full_name":"Liudas Panavas","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37597152500","id":37597152500,"full_name":"Tarik Crnovrsanin","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/561962341709260","id":561962341709260,"full_name":"Jane Lydia Adams","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37845489200","id":37845489200,"full_name":"Jonathan Ullman","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Massachusetts, Amherst, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/679613891600799","id":679613891600799,"full_name":"Ali Sargavad","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Massachusetts, Amherst, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275861300","id":37275861300,"full_name":"Melanie Tory","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38350716800","id":38350716800,"full_name":"Cody Dunne","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Early Access Articles","abstract":"Increasingly, visualization practitioners are working with, using, and studying private and sensitive data. There can be many stakeholders interested in the resulting analyses-but widespread sharing of the data can cause harm to individuals, companies, and organizations. Practitioners are increasingly turning to differential privacy to enable public data sharing with a guaranteed amount of privacy. Differential privacy algorithms do this by aggregating data statistics with noise, and this now-private data can be released visually with differentially private scatterplots. While the private visual output is affected by the algorithm choice, privacy level, bin number, data distribution, and user task, there is little guidance on how to choose and balance the effect of these parameters. To address this gap, we had experts examine 1,200 differentially private scatterplots created with a variety of parameter choices and tested their ability to see aggregate patterns in the private output (i.e. the visual utility of the chart). We synthesized these results to provide easy-to-use guidance for visualization practitioners releasing private data through scatterplots. Our findings also provide a ground truth for visual utility, which we use to benchmark automated utility metrics from various fields. We demonstrate how multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM), the metric most strongly correlated with our study's utility results, can be used to optimize parameter selection.

Our technique takes as an input aligned tilt-series from cryogenic electron microscopy and creates denoised 3D tomograms using a proximal jointly-optimized approach that iteratively performs reconstruction and denoising, relieving the users of the need to select appropriate denoising algorithms in the pre-reconstruction or post-reconstruction steps. The whole process is accelerated by exploiting parallelism on modern GPUs, and the results can be visualized immediately after the reconstruction using volume rendering tools incorporated in the framework. We show that our technique can be used with multiple combinations of reconstruction algorithms and regularizers, thanks to the flexibility provided by proximal algorithms. Additionally, the reconstruction framework is open-source and can be easily extended with additional reconstruction and denoising methods. Furthermore, our approach enables visualization of reconstruction error throughout the iterative process within the reconstructed tomogram and on projection planes of the input tilt-series. We evaluate our approach in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches and additionally show how our error visualization can be used for reconstruction evaluation.","article_number":"9992117","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9992117","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9992117/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9992117/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4359476,"publication_year":2022,"start_page":"1","end_page":"15","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":446,"insert_date":"20221219","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image reconstruction","Noise reduction","Uncertainty","Three-dimensional displays","Iterative methods","Visualization","Electron microscopy"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["tomographic reconstruction","electron tomography","tilt-series","visualization","cryo-ET","GPU acceleration"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3119212","title":"Fuzzy Spreadsheet: Understanding and Exploring Uncertainties in Tabular Calculations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":62,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Pro2Future GmbH, Linz, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089664341","id":37089664341,"full_name":"Vaishali Dhanoa","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Pro2Future GmbH, Linz, Austria","Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089664419","id":37089664419,"full_name":"Conny Walchshofer","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088767380","id":37088767380,"full_name":"Andreas Hinterreiter","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Wien, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284271200","id":37284271200,"full_name":"Eduard Gröller","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Wien, Vienna, Austria","VRVis Research Center, Wien, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403918900","id":37403918900,"full_name":"Marc Streit","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Spreadsheet-based tools provide a simple yet effective way of calculating values, which makes them the number-one choice for building and formalizing simple models for budget planning and many other applications.

Therefore, spreadsheets are of limited use when investigating the inherent uncertainties of such models and answering what-if questions. Existing extensions typically require a complex modeling process that cannot easily be embedded in a tabular layout. In Fuzzy Spreadsheet, a cell can hold and display a distribution of values. This integrated uncertainty-handling immediately conveys sensitivity and robustness information. The fuzzification of the cells enables calculations not only with precise values but also with distributions, and probabilities. We conservatively added and carefully crafted visuals to maintain the look and feel of a traditional spreadsheet while facilitating what-if analyses. Given a user-specified reference cell, Fuzzy Spreadsheet automatically extracts and visualizes contextually relevant information, such as impact, uncertainty, and degree of neighborhood, for the selected and related cells. To evaluate its usability and the perceived mental effort required, we conducted a user study.

In this paper, we present a two-stage adaptation framework that supports the automated retargeting and semi-automated tailoring of a desktop MV visualization for rendering on devices with displays of varying sizes. First, we cast layout retargeting as an optimization problem and propose a simulated annealing technique that can automatically preserve the layout of multiple views. Second, we enable fine-tuning for the visual appearance of each view, using a rule-based auto configuration method complemented with an interactive interface for chart-oriented encoding adjustment. To demonstrate the feasibility and expressivity of our proposed approach, we present a gallery of MV visualizations that have been adapted from the desktop to small displays. We also report the result of a user study comparing visualizations generated using our approach with those by existing methods. The outcome indicates that the participants generally prefer visualizations generated using our approach and find them to be easier to use.","article_number":"10029921","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10029921","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10029921/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10029921/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4359476,"publication_year":2023,"start_page":"1","end_page":"15","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":359,"insert_date":"20230130","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Layout","Mobile handsets","Bars","Stacking","Design methodology"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Layout adaptation","mobile devices","multiple-view visualization","responsive design"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3259341","title":"Are Metrics Enough?

Accuracy and error metrics alone fail to tell the whole story of a model – its risks, strengths, and limitations – making it difficult for subject matter experts to feel confident in their decision to use a model. As a result, models may fail in unexpected ways or go entirely unused, as subject matter experts disregard poorly presented models in favor of familiar, yet arguably substandard methods. In this paper, we describe an iterative study conducted with both subject matter experts and data scientists to understand the gaps in communication between these two groups. We find that, while the two groups share common goals of understanding the data and predictions of the model, friction can stem from unfamiliar terms, metrics, and visualizations – limiting the transfer of knowledge to SMEs and discouraging clarifying questions being asked during presentations. Based on our findings, we derive a set of communication guidelines that use visualization as a common medium for communicating the strengths and weaknesses of a model. We provide a demonstration of our guidelines in a regression modeling scenario and elicit feedback on their use from subject matter experts. From our demonstration, subject matter experts were more comfortable discussing a model's performance, more aware of the trade-offs for the presented model, and better equipped to assess the model's risks – ultimately informing and contextualizing the model's use beyond text and numbers.","article_number":"10077087","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10077087","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10077087/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10077087/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4359476,"publication_year":2023,"start_page":"1","end_page":"16","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":221,"insert_date":"20230320","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data models","Data visualization","Predictive models","Interviews","Data science","Guidelines","Stakeholders"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization techniques and methodologies","Human factors","Modeling and prediction","Data communications aspects"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3282364","title":"PanVA: Pangenomic Variant Analysis","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"99","issn":"2160-9306","rank":65,"volume":"PP","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/190642155356499","id":190642155356499,"full_name":"Astrid van den Brandt","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands"]}},{"affiliation":"Bioinformatics Group, Wageningen University & Research, Wageningen, The Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/979146825673826","id":979146825673826,"full_name":"Eef M.

Such a dual analysis of the feature space and data space is characterized by three components, (1) a view visualizing feature summaries, (2) a view that visualizes the data records, and (3) a bidirectional linking of both plots triggered by human interaction in one of both visualizations, e.g., Linking & Brushing. Dual analysis approaches span many domains, e.g., medicine, crime analysis, and biology. The proposed solutions encapsulate various techniques, such as feature selection or statistical analysis. However, each approach establishes a new definition of dual analysis. To address this gap, we systematically reviewed published dual analysis methods to investigate and formalize the key elements, such as the techniques used to visualize the feature space and data space, as well as the interaction between both spaces. From the information elicited during our review, we propose a unified theoretical framework for dual analysis, encompassing all existing approaches extending the field. We apply our proposed formalization describing the interactions between each component and relate them to the addressed tasks. Additionally, we categorize the existing approaches using our framework and derive future research directions to advance dual analysis by including state-of-the-art visual analysis techniques to improve data exploration.","article_number":"10158903","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10158903","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10158903/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10158903/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4359476,"publication_year":2023,"start_page":"1","end_page":"17","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":208,"insert_date":"20230621","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Analytical models","Data models","Visual analytics","Task analysis","Adaptation models","Taxonomy"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","dual analysis","feature space","data space","feature exploration","mixed data","high-dimensional data"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3099002","title":"AI4VIS: Survey on Artificial Intelligence Approaches for Data Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":67,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086808853","id":37086808853,"full_name":"Aoyu Wu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086545328","id":37086545328,"full_name":"Yun Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086245904","id":37086245904,"full_name":"Xinhuan Shu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085711170","id":37085711170,"full_name":"Dominik Moritz","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA","Apple, Cupertino, CA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37391623900","id":37391623900,"full_name":"Weiwei Cui","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073639100","id":37073639100,"full_name":"Haidong Zhang","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37963085000","id":37963085000,"full_name":"Dongmei Zhang","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Visualizations themselves have become a data format. Akin to other data formats such as text and images, visualizations are increasingly created, stored, shared, and (re-)used with artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. In this survey, we probe the underlying vision of formalizing visualizations as an emerging data format and review the recent advance in applying AI techniques to visualization data (AI4VIS). We define visualization data as the digital representations of visualizations in computers and focus on data visualization (e.g., charts and infographics). We build our survey upon a corpus spanning ten different fields in computer science with an eye toward identifying important common interests. Our resulting taxonomy is organized around WHAT is visualization data and its representation, WHY and HOW to apply AI to visualization data. We highlight a set of common tasks that researchers apply to the visualization data and present a detailed discussion of AI approaches developed to accomplish those tasks. Drawing upon our literature review, we discuss several important research questions surrounding the management and exploitation of visualization data, as well as the role of AI in support of those processes.

To successfully adapt ML techniques for visualizations, a structured understanding of the integration of ML4VIS is needed. In this article, we systematically survey 88 ML4VIS studies, aiming to answer two motivating questions: “what visualization processes can be assisted by ML?” and “how ML techniques can be used to solve visualization problems? ”This survey reveals seven main processes where the employment of ML techniques can benefit visualizations: Data Processing4VIS, Data-VIS Mapping, Insight Communication, Style Imitation, VIS Interaction, VIS Reading, and User Profiling. The seven processes are related to existing visualization theoretical models in an ML4VIS pipeline, aiming to illuminate the role of ML-assisted visualization in general visualizations. Meanwhile, the seven processes are mapped into main learning tasks in ML to align the capabilities of ML with the needs in visualization. Current practices and future opportunities of ML4VIS are discussed in the context of the ML4VIS pipeline and the ML-VIS mapping.

We connect AR visualizations with data streams from the Internet of Things using distributed dataflow. To this end, we use reactive programming patterns so that visualizations become context-aware, i.e., they adapt to events coming in from the environment.

Existing methods cannot meet the need for understanding different models in one framework due to the lack of a unified measure for explaining both low-level (e.g., words) and high-level (e.g., phrases) features. We have developed a visual analysis tool, DeepNLPVis, to enable a unified understanding of NLP models for text classification. The key idea is a mutual information-based measure, which provides quantitative explanations on how each layer of a model maintains the information of input words in a sample. We model the intra- and inter-word information at each layer measuring the importance of a word to the final prediction as well as the relationships between words, such as the formation of phrases. A multi-level visualization, which consists of a corpus-level, a sample-level, and a word-level visualization, supports the analysis from the overall training set to individual samples. Two case studies on classification tasks and comparison between models demonstrate that DeepNLPVis can help users effectively identify potential problems caused by samples and model architectures and then make informed improvements.","article_number":"9801603","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9801603","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9801603/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9801603/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9930678,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 Dec. 2022","start_page":"4980","end_page":"4994","citing_paper_count":19,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2054,"insert_date":"20220620","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Computational modeling","Analytical models","Visualization","Internet","Data models","Computer architecture","Adaptation models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Explainable AI","visual debugging","visual analytics","deep NLP model","information-based interpretation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Classification Model","Deep Models","Text Classification","Text Categorization","Document Classification","Natural Language Processing Models","Text Classification Model","Training Set","Classification Task","Categorization Task","Visualization Tool","Model Architecture","Layer Model","High-level Features","Higher-level Features","Need For Understanding","Low-level Features","Understanding Of Models","Important Words","Word Information","Input Word","Sample Of Words","Quantitative Explanation","Visual Analytics Tool","LSTM Model","BERT Model","Context Words","Relevant Words","Context Vector","Prediction Score","Term Frequency-inverse Document Frequency","Inverse Document Frequency","TF-IDF","Model Performance","Layer 7","Fine-tuned Model"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3098240","title":"A Survey of Perception-Based Visualization Studies by Task","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":72,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086556695","id":37086556695,"full_name":"Ghulam Jilani Quadri","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37398611400","id":37398611400,"full_name":"Paul Rosen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Knowledge of human perception has long been incorporated into visualizations to enhance their quality and effectiveness.

This survey reviews perception-focused visualization studies since 1980 and summarizes their research developments focusing on low-level tasks, further breaking techniques down by visual encoding and visualization type. In particular, we focus on how perception is used to evaluate the effectiveness of visualizations, to help readers understand and apply the principles of perception of their visualization designs through a task-optimized approach. We concluded our report with a summary of the weaknesses and open research questions in the area.","article_number":"9492011","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9492011","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9492011/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9492011/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9930678,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 Dec. 2022","start_page":"5026","end_page":"5048","citing_paper_count":17,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1659,"insert_date":"20210720","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Task analysis","Taxonomy","Encoding","Visual analytics","Crowdsourcing"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","perception","graphical perception","visual analytics tasks","evaluation","survey"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Design","Visual Encoding","Highest Accuracy","Completion Time","Visual Task","Bar Charts","Pie Chart","Spatial Size","Perceptual Bias","Perceptual Biases","Font Size","Stimulus Change","Changes In Stimuli","User Performance","Line Chart","Graph Size","Positional Encoding","Just Noticeable Difference","Just-noticeable-difference","Type Of Visualization","Visual Judgment","Spatial Encoding","Parallel Coordinates","Affective Priming","Symbol Size","User Preferences","Color Map","Colour Map","Colormap","Visual Channels","Set Of Cases","Size Perception","Visual Features","Visual Characteristics","Weber Fraction","Visual Perception"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3133511","title":"Labeling Out-of-View Objects in Immersive Analytics to Support Situated Visual Searching","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"2160-9306","rank":73,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"John A.

Data can be shown in-situ, thereby enabling real-time visual comparisons and object search in real-life user tasks, such as comparing products and looking up scores in a sports game. While there have been studies on designing AR interfaces for situated information retrieval, there has only been limited research on AR object labeling for visual search tasks in the spatial environment. In this article, we identify and categorize different design aspects in AR label design and report on a formal user study on labels for out-of-view objects to support visual search tasks in AR. We design three visualization techniques for out-of-view object labeling in AR, which respectively encode the relative physical position (height-encoded), the rotational direction (angle-encoded), and the label values (value-encoded) of the objects. We further implement two traditional in-view object labeling techniques, where labels are placed either next to the respective objects (situated) or at the edge of the AR FoV (boundary). We evaluate these five different label conditions in three visual search tasks for static objects. Our study shows that out-of-view object labels are beneficial when searching for objects outside the FoV, spatial orientation, and when comparing multiple spatially sparse objects. Angle-encoded labels with directional cues of the surrounding objects have the overall best performance with the highest user satisfaction. We discuss the implications of our findings for future immersive AR interface design.","article_number":"9645242","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9645242","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9645242/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9645242/","publication_title":"IEEE

2020. As a worldwide emergency response, governments have implemented various measures and policies, such as self-quarantine, travel restrictions, work from home, and regional lockdown, to control the spread of the epidemic. These countermeasures seek to restrict human mobility because COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease that is spread by human-to-human transmission. Medical experts and policymakers have expressed the urgency to effectively evaluate the outcome of human restriction policies with the aid of big data and information technology. Thus, based on big human mobility data and city POI data, an interactive visual analytics system called Epidemic Mobility (EpiMob) was designed in this study. The system interactively simulates the changes in human mobility and infection status in response to the implementation of a certain restriction policy or a combination of policies (e.g., regional lockdown, telecommuting, screening). Users can conveniently designate the spatial and temporal ranges for different mobility restriction policies. Then, the results reflecting the infection situation under different policies are dynamically displayed and can be flexibly compared and analyzed in depth. Multiple case studies consisting of interviews with domain experts were conducted in the largest metropolitan area of Japan (i.e., Greater Tokyo Area) to demonstrate that the system can provide insight into the effects of different human mobility restriction policies for epidemic control, through measurements and comparisons.","article_number":"9750868","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9750868","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9750868/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9750868/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10168673,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"1 Aug. 2023","start_page":"3586","end_page":"3601","citing_paper_count":14,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":767,"insert_date":"20220406","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Epidemics","Urban areas","COVID-19","Visual analytics","Trajectory","Data models","Analytical models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Human mobility simulation","epidemic control","visual analytics","interactive system","big trajectory data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Pandemic Response","Outbreak Response","Epidemic Control","Outbreak Control","Limited Mobility","Mobility Restrictions","Human Mobility Restrictions","Policy Implementation","Effective Policies","Human Data","Working From Home","Work At Home","Domain Experts","Telework","Telecommuting","Remote Work","Restrictive Policies","Limited Policy","Travel Restrictions","Multiple Case Study","Areas Of Japan","Combination Of Policies","Point Of Interest Data","Tokyo Area","Simulation Results","Disease Transmission","Disease Spread","In-depth Analysis","Parameter Settings","Point Of Interest","Epidemic Model","Policy Settings","SEIR Model","Lockdown Policies","Shopping Mall","Time Slot","Human Trajectory","Visual Design","Raw Trajectories"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3197203","title":"CoordNet: Data Generation and Visualization Generation for Time-Varying Volumes via a Coordinate-Based Neural Network","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":75,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Data Science, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086862620","id":37086862620,"full_name":"Jun Han","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Data Science, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37405886900","id":37405886900,"full_name":"Chaoli Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Although deep learning has demonstrated its capability in solving diverse scientific visualization problems, it still lacks generalization power across different tasks.

It is therefore difficult to diagnose possible errors of GNNs. Despite many visual analytics studies being done on CNNs and RNNs, little research has addressed the challenges for GNNs. This paper fills the research gap with an interactive visual analysis tool, GNNLens, to assist model developers and users in understanding and analyzing GNNs. Specifically, Parallel Sets View and Projection View enable users to quickly identify and validate error patterns in the set of wrong predictions; Graph View and Feature Matrix View offer a detailed analysis of individual nodes to assist users in forming hypotheses about the error patterns. Since GNNs jointly model the graph structure and the node features, we reveal the relative influences of the two types of information by comparing the predictions of three models: GNN, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and GNN Without Using Features (GNNWUF).

Feature engineering in particular can be very beneficial for ML, leading to numerous improvements such as boosting the predictive results, decreasing computational times, reducing excessive noise, and increasing the transparency behind the decisions taken during the training. Despite that, while several visual analytics tools exist to monitor and control the different stages of the ML life cycle (especially those related to data and algorithms), feature engineering support remains inadequate. In this paper, we present FeatureEnVi, a visual analytics system specifically designed to assist with the feature engineering process. Our proposed system helps users to choose the most important feature, to transform the original features into powerful alternatives, and to experiment with different feature generation combinations. Additionally, data space slicing allows users to explore the impact of features on both local and global scales. FeatureEnVi utilizes multiple automatic feature selection techniques; furthermore, it visually guides users with statistical evidence about the influence of each feature (or subsets of features).

Morphological changes in the dendritic spine often reflect alterations in physiological conditions and are indicators of various neuropsychiatric conditions. However, owing to the highly dynamic and heterogeneous nature of spines, accurate measurement and objective analysis of spine morphology are major challenges in neuroscience research. Most conventional approaches for analyzing dendritic spines are based on two-dimensional (2D) images, which barely reflect the actual three-dimensional (3D) shapes. Although some recent studies have attempted to analyze spines with various 3D-based features, it is still difficult to objectively categorize and analyze spines based on 3D morphology. Here, we propose a unified visualization framework for an interactive 3D dendritic spine analysis system, DXplorer, that displays 3D rendering of spines and plots the high-dimensional features extracted from the 3D mesh of spines. With this system, users can perform the clustering of spines interactively and explore and analyze dendritic spines based on high-dimensional features. We propose a series of high-dimensional morphological features extracted from a 3D mesh of dendritic spines. In addition, an interactive machine learning classifier with visual exploration and user feedback using an interactive 3D mesh grid view ensures a more precise classification based on the spine phenotype. A user study and two case studies were conducted to quantitatively verify the performance and usability of the DXplorer. We demonstrate that the system performs the entire analytic process effectively and provides high-quality, accurate, and objective analysis.","article_number":"9555234","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555234","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9555234/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9555234/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10003072,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"1 Feb. 2023","start_page":"1424","end_page":"1437","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":668,"insert_date":"20210930","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three-dimensional displays","Feature extraction","Head","Neck","Morphology","Shape","Visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Biomedical and medical visualization","machine learning","task and requirements analysis","user interfaces","intelligence analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Morphological Features","Morphological Characteristics","Interaction Analysis","Dendritic Spines","3D Morphology","Visual Framework","Spine Analysis","Dendritic Spine Analysis","3D Morphological Features","Machine Learning","Machine-learning","Morphological Changes","Neuroscience","Neurobiological","Morphological Analysis","Neuropsychiatric","Neuropsychiatric Disorders","User Study","2D Images","Machine Learning Classifiers","High-dimensional Feature","3D Mesh","Surface Mesh","3D Shape","Spine Shape","Thin Spines","Stubby Spines","Phenotypic Classification","Phenotypic Categories","Number Of Spines","Mushroom Spines","Raw Images","Mesh Generation","Grid Generation","Synaptic Region","Synaptic Area"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3130670","title":"Molecumentary: Adaptable Narrated Documentaries Using Molecular Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"2160-9306","rank":80,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086238484","id":37086238484,"full_name":"David Kouřil","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic","TU Wien, Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Saudi Arabia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656920","id":37088656920,"full_name":"Ondřej Strnad","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Wien and Nanographics GmbH, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086231000","id":37086231000,"full_name":"Peter Mindek","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Wien and Nanographics GmbH, Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"CNRS, Inria, LISN, Université Paris-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101340","id":37087101340,"full_name":"Sarkis Halladjian","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["CNRS, Inria, LISN, Université Paris-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"]}},{"affiliation":"CNRS, Inria, LISN, Université Paris-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37297057400","id":37297057400,"full_name":"Tobias Isenberg","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["CNRS, Inria, LISN, Université Paris-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Wien and the VRVis Research Center, Wien, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282552200","id":37282552200,"full_name":"M.

We introduce molecumentaries, i.e., molecular documentaries featuring structural models from molecular biology, created through adaptable methods instead of the rigid traditional production pipeline. Our work is motivated by the rapid evolution of scientific visualization and it potential in science dissemination. Without some form of explanation or guidance, however, novices and lay-persons often find it difficult to gain insights from the visualization itself. We integrate such knowledge using the verbal channel and provide it along an engaging visual presentation. To realize the synthesis of a molecumentary, we provide technical solutions along two major production steps: (1) preparing a story structure and (2) turning the story into a concrete narrative. In the first step, we compile information about the model from heterogeneous sources into a story graph. We combine local knowledge with external sources to complete the story graph and enrich the final result. In the second step, we synthesize a narrative, i.e., story elements presented in sequence, using the story graph. We then traverse the story graph and generate a virtual tour, using automated camera and visualization transitions. We turn texts written by domain experts into verbal representations using text-to-speech functionality and provide them as a commentary. Using the described framework, we synthesize fly-throughs with descriptions: automatic ones that mimic a manually authored documentary or semi-automatic ones which guide the documentary narrative solely through curated textual input.","article_number":"9627526","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9627526","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9627526/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9627526/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10032251,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"1 March 2023","start_page":"1733","end_page":"1747","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1419,"insert_date":"20211125","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Cameras","Three-dimensional displays","Animation","Real-time systems","Solid modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Virtual tour","audio","biological data","storytelling","illustrative visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Documentary","Documentary Film","Molecular Visualization","Scientific Community","Domain Experts","Real-time Visualization","Input Text","Story Elements","Story Structure","Traditional Pipeline","Scientific Visualization","Conceptual Framework","Data Visualization","Molecular Modeling","Visual Representation","Textual Descriptions","3D Visualization","Interactive Visualization","Scripps Research","Adaptive Way","Types Of Scenes","Verbal Comments","Camera Control","Camera Orientation","Composite Objects","Computer Animation","Inner Nodes","Interior Nodes","Explanatory Information","Camera Movement","Specific Narratives","Focal Object","Object Focus","Focusing Objective"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3182488","title":"Diagnosing Ensemble Few-Shot Classifiers","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"9","issn":"2160-9306","rank":81,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088637276","id":37088637276,"full_name":"Weikai Yang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087499275","id":37087499275,"full_name":"Xi Ye","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Technology, BNRist, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086491789","id":37086491789,"full_name":"Xingxing Zhang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, BNRist, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Academy of Arts & Design, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089469466","id":37089469466,"full_name":"Lanxi Xiao","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Academy of Arts & Design, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37531405500","id":37531405500,"full_name":"Jiazhi Xia","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Kuaishou Technology Company Ltd., Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37070366400","id":37070366400,"full_name":"Zhongyuan Wang","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Kuaishou Technology Company Ltd., Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Technology, BNRist, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490433400","id":38490433400,"full_name":"Jun Zhu","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, BNRist, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275698100","id":37275698100,"full_name":"Hanspeter Pfister","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406039100","id":37406039100,"full_name":"Shixia Liu","author_order":9,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The base learners and labeled samples (shots) in an ensemble few-shot classifier greatly affect the model performance.

Given a set of base learners and a collection of samples with a few shots, we consider two problems: 1) finding a subset of base learners that well predict the sample collections; and 2) replacing the low-quality shots with more representative ones to adequately represent the sample collections. We formulate both problems as sparse subset selection and develop two selection algorithms to recommend appropriate learners and shots, respectively. A matrix visualization and a scatterplot are combined to explain the recommended learners and shots in context and facilitate users in adjusting them. Based on the adjustment, the algorithm updates the recommendation results for another round of improvement.

In this paper, we propose a visual analytics approach to help model developers interpret the model failures. The system includes the micro- and macro-interpreting modules to address the interpretability problem of object detection in autonomous driving. The micro-interpreting module extracts and visualizes the features of a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm with density maps, while the macro-interpreting module provides spatial-temporal information of an autonomous driving vehicle and its environment. With the situation awareness of the spatial, temporal and neural network information, our system facilitates the understanding of the results of object detection algorithms, and helps the model developers better understand, tune and develop the models. We use real-world autonomous driving data to perform case studies by involving domain experts in computer vision and autonomous driving to evaluate our system.

However, detectors trained on caption supervision perform poorly because captions are usually noisy and cannot provide precise location information. To tackle this issue, we present a visual analysis method, which tightly integrates caption supervision with object detection to mutually enhance each other. In particular, object labels are first extracted from captions, which are utilized to train the detectors. Then, the objects detected from images are fed into caption supervision for further improvement. To effectively loop users into the object detection process, a node-link-based set visualization supported by a multi-type relational co-clustering algorithm is developed to explain the relationships between the extracted labels and the images with detected objects. The co-clustering algorithm clusters labels and images simultaneously by utilizing both their representations and their relationships. Quantitative evaluations and a case study are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the developed method in improving the performance of object detectors.","article_number":"9664269","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9664269","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9664269/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9664269/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9721431,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 April 2022","start_page":"1941","end_page":"1954","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1990,"insert_date":"20211228","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Detectors","Annotations","Object detection","Visualization","Training","Labeling","Noise measurement"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Machine learning","interactive visualization","object detection","caption supervision","co-clustering"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Object Detection","Development Of Methods","Developed Method","Detection Performance","Bounding Box","Cluster Labels","Image Captioning","Bounding Box Annotations","Bounding-box Annotations","Global Level","Number Of Images","Image Object","Precision And Recall","Clustering Results","Cloud Data","Word Cloud","Word Clouds","Small Objects","Ratio Images","Large Number Of Images","Image Annotation","Semi-supervised Methods","Semi-supervised Method","Object Detection Methods","Object Detection Method","Number Of Annotations","Grid Layout","Natural Language Processing Models","Consistency Constraint","Robust Constraints","Different Levels Of Detail","Square Of The Distance","Information Panel","Number Of Labels","Cluster A","Interactive Visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3109460","title":"NeuroConstruct: 3D Reconstruction and Visualization of Neurites in Optical Microscopy Brain Images","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":84,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086943983","id":37086943983,"full_name":"Parmida Ghahremani","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086546371","id":37086546371,"full_name":"Saeed Boorboor","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089574039","id":37089574039,"full_name":"Pooya Mirhosseini","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086309526","id":37086309526,"full_name":"Chetan Gudisagar","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086546781","id":37086546781,"full_name":"Mala Ananth","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37269512100","id":37269512100,"full_name":"David Talmage","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086546468","id":37086546468,"full_name":"Lorna W.

To visualize neurites in a given volume, NeuroConstruct offers a hybrid rendering by combining iso-surface rendering of high-confidence classified neurites, along with real-time rendering of raw volume using a 2D transfer function for voxel classification score versus voxel intensity value. For a complete reconstruction of the 3D neurites, we introduce a Registration Toolbox that provides automatic coarse-to-fine alignment of serially sectioned samples. The quantitative and qualitative analysis show that NeuroConstruct outperforms the state-of-the-art in all design aspects.

To support effective exploration and understanding of these clusters, we introduce StrategyAtlas, a system designed to analyze and explain model strategies. Furthermore, it supports multiple ways to utilize these strategies for simplifying and improving the reference model.

One of the most prominent techniques for assembling these structures is DNA origami. Nowadays, desktop applications are used for the in silico design of such structures. However, as such structures are often spatially complex, their assembly and analysis are complicated. Since virtual reality (VR) was proven to be advantageous for such spatial-related tasks and there are no existing VR solutions focused on this domain, we propose Vivern, a VR application that allows domain experts to design and visually examine DNA origami nanostructures. Our approach presents different abstracted visual representations of the nanostructures, various color schemes, and an ability to place several DNA nanostructures and proteins in one environment, thus allowing for the detailed analysis of complex assemblies. We also present two novel examination tools, the Magic Scale Lens and the DNA Untwister, that allow the experts to visually embed different representations into local regions to preserve the context and support detailed investigation. To showcase the capabilities of our solution, prototypes of novel nanodevices conceptualized by our collaborating experts, such as DNA-protein hybrid structures and DNA origami superstructures, are presented. Finally, the results of two rounds of evaluations are summarized. They demonstrate the advantages of our solution, especially for scenarios where current desktop tools are very limited, while also presenting possible future research directions.","article_number":"9523759","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9523759","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9523759/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9523759/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9930678,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 Dec. 2022","start_page":"4825","end_page":"4838","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1130,"insert_date":"20210826","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["DNA","Nanostructures","Data visualization","Solid modeling","Virtual reality","Three-dimensional displays","Nanoscale devices"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Virtual reality","abstraction","DNA origami","nanostructures","visualization","focus+context","interaction","in silico modeling","nanotechnology","multiscale","magic scale lens"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Virtually","Virtual Environment","Virtual Reality","Multiscale Model","DNA Nanostructures","Visual Representation","Domain Experts","Hybrid Structure","Color Scheme","Colour Scheme","Abstract Representations","DNA Origami","Desktop Application","Nanorobots","Nanobots","Single-stranded","Single Strand","Part Of Structure","DNA Structures","DNA Topology","3D Space","3-dimensional Space","Double Strand","Double Helix","DNA Double Helix","DNA Helix","Double Helices","B-form DNA","Double-helical","Visualization Techniques","3D Visualization","Object Position","Visual Concepts","Molecular Visualization","Individual Strands","Interaction Techniques","Origami Structures","Semantic Scale","Multiscale Approach","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Interactive Visualization","Objective Space"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3156760","title":"Visual Exploration of Relationships and Structure in Low-Dimensional Embeddings","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"7","issn":"2160-9306","rank":87,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089848351","id":37089848351,"full_name":"Klaus Eckelt","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088767380","id":37088767380,"full_name":"Andreas Hinterreiter","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089849090","id":37089849090,"full_name":"Patrick Adelberger","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089664419","id":37089664419,"full_name":"Conny Walchshofer","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089664341","id":37089664341,"full_name":"Vaishali Dhanoa","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria","Pro2Future GmbH, Linz, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089849424","id":37089849424,"full_name":"Christina Humer","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089848913","id":37089848913,"full_name":"Moritz Heckmann","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089848164","id":37089848164,"full_name":"Christian Steinparz","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403918900","id":37403918900,"full_name":"Marc Streit","author_order":9,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"]}}]},"access_type":"CCBY - IEEE is not the copyright holder of this material.

Nevertheless, most existing methods for the visual exploration of embeddings treat these structures as second-class citizens or do not take them into account at all. In our proposed analysis workflow, users explore enriched scatterplots of the embedding, in which relationships between items and/or groups are visually highlighted. The original high-dimensional data for single items, groups of items, or differences between connected items and groups are accessible through additional summary visualizations. We carefully tailored these summary and difference visualizations to the various data types and semantic contexts. During their exploratory analysis, users can externalize their insights by setting up additional groups and relationships between items and/or groups.

In order to design more powerful transfer functions, we propose leveraging soft segmentation as an explicit component of visualization for noisy volumes. Our technical realization is based on semi-supervised learning, where we combine the advantages of two segmentation algorithms. First, the weak segmentation algorithm provides good results for propagating sparse user-provided labels to other voxels in the same volume and is used to generate dense pseudo-labels. Second, the powerful deep-learning-based segmentation algorithm learns from these pseudo-labels to generalize the segmentation to other unseen volumes, a task that the weak segmentation algorithm fails at completely. The proposed volume visualization uses deep-learning-based segmentation as a component for segmentation-aware transfer function design. Appropriate ramp parameters can be suggested automatically through frequency distribution analysis. Furthermore, our visualization uses gradient-free ambient occlusion shading to further suppress the visual presence of noise, and to give structural detail the desired prominence. The cryo-ET data studied in our technical experiments are based on the highest-quality tilted series of intact SARS-CoV-2 virions. Our technique shows the high impact in target sciences for visual data analysis of very noisy volumes that cannot be visualized with existing techniques.","article_number":"9806341","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9806341","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9806341/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9806341/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10237330,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"1 Oct. 2023","start_page":"4198","end_page":"4214","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1043,"insert_date":"20220624","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Image segmentation","Visualization","Task analysis","Three-dimensional displays","Signal to noise ratio","Noise measurement"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Volume rendering","computer graphics techniques","machine learning techniques","scalar field data","life sciences"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Signal-to-noise","Signal-to-noise Ratio","Transfer Function","Segmentation Algorithm","Semi-supervised Learning","Sparse Labeling","Frequency Distribution Analysis","Neural Network","Deep Learning","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2","Denoising","Noise Reduction","Noisy Data","Domain Experts","Maximum Intensity Projection","Manual Annotation","3D Visualization","Visual Map","Manual Labeling","Binary Label","Pseudo Labels","Segment Classification","3D U-Net","Soft Labels","Raw Volume","Subtomogram Averaging","Ilastik","Computer Workstation","Raw Data","Segmented Volume","Generative Adversarial Networks","Adversarial Learning","Deep Neural Network"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3122176","title":"Comparative Analysis of Merge Trees Using Local Tree Edit Distance","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":90,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Automation, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, Karnataka, India","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087410385","id":37087410385,"full_name":"Raghavendra Sridharamurthy","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Automation, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, Karnataka, India"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Automation, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, Karnataka, India","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37278509300","id":37278509300,"full_name":"Vijay Natarajan","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Automation, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, Karnataka, India"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Comparative analysis of scalar fields is an important problem with various applications including feature-directed visualization and feature tracking in time-varying data. Comparing topological structures that are abstract and succinct representations of the scalar fields lead to faster and meaningful comparison. While there are many distance or similarity measures to compare topological structures in a global context, there are no known measures for comparing topological structures locally. While the global measures have many applications, they do not directly lend themselves to fine-grained analysis across multiple scales. We define a local variant of the tree edit distance and apply it towards local comparative analysis of merge trees with support for finer analysis. We also present experimental results on time-varying scalar fields, 3D cryo-electron microscopy data, and other synthetic data sets to show the utility of this approach in applications like symmetry detection and feature tracking.","article_number":"9585392","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9585392","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9585392/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9585392/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10003072,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"1 Feb. 2023","start_page":"1518","end_page":"1530","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":259,"insert_date":"20211026","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Isosurfaces","Feature extraction","Costs","Measurement","Transforms","Indexes","Image color analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Merge tree","scalar field","local distance measure","persistence","edit distance","symmetry detection","feature tracking"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Distant Locations","Edit Distance","Merging Algorithm","Merge Tree","Graph Edit Distance","Tree Edit Distance","Local Editing","Distancing Measures","Similarity Measure","Similarity Metrics","Multiple Scales","Global Measures","Topological Structure","Fine-grained Analysis","Feature Tracking","Feature-tracking","Time-varying Data","Pairing","AMP-activated Protein Kinase","AMP-activated Kinase","Adenosine Monophosphate-activated Protein Kinase","AMPK","Region Of Domain","Dynamic Programming","Regional Volume","Topological Features","Topological Characteristics","Submatrix","Submatrices","Edit Operations","Secondary Vortices","Secondary Vortex","Symmetric Region","Effect Of Compression","Dynamic Programming Algorithm","Refinement Step","Joining Tree","Junction Tree","Tree-decomposition","Tree Decomposition","Cost Model","Isosurface","Sublevel Set","Superlevel Sets"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3097709","title":"DeHumor: Visual Analytics for Decomposing Humor","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":91,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101987","id":37087101987,"full_name":"Xingbo Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"Bloomberg LP, New York, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086012043","id":37086012043,"full_name":"Yao Ming","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Bloomberg LP, New York, NY, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089657400","id":37089657400,"full_name":"Tongshuang Wu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085732774","id":37085732774,"full_name":"Haipeng Zeng","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Singapore Management University, Singapore, Singapore","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089654484","id":37089654484,"full_name":"Yong Wang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Singapore Management University, Singapore, Singapore"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Despite being a critical communication skill, grasping humor is challenging—a successful use of humor requires a mixture of both engaging content build-up and an appropriate vocal delivery (e.g., pause). Prior studies on computational humor emphasize the textual and audio features immediately next to the punchline, yet overlooking longer-term context setup. Moreover, the theories are usually too abstract for understanding each concrete humor snippet. To fill in the gap, we develop DeHumor, a visual analytical system for analyzing humorous behaviors in public speaking. To intuitively reveal the building blocks of each concrete example, DeHumor decomposes each humorous video into multimodal features and provides inline annotations of them on the video script. In particular, to better capture the build-ups, we introduce content repetition as a complement to features introduced in theories of computational humor and visualize them in a context linking graph. To help users locate the punchlines that have the desired features to learn, we summarize the content (with keywords) and humor feature statistics on an augmented time matrix. With case studies on stand-up comedy shows and TED talks, we show that DeHumor is able to highlight various building blocks of humor examples. In addition, expert interviews with communication coaches and humor researchers demonstrate the effectiveness of DeHumor for multimodal humor analysis of speech content and vocal delivery.","article_number":"9488285","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9488285","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9488285/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9488285/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9930678,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 Dec. 2022","start_page":"4609","end_page":"4623","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":847,"insert_date":"20210716","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Interviews","Public speaking","Speech","Semantics","Phonetics","Feature extraction","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Humor","context","multimodal features","visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Public Speaking","Oral Presentations","Public Speech","Guest Speakers","Concrete Examples","Textual Features","Expert Interviews","Content Delivery","Multimodal Analysis","Multimodal Features","Stand-up","Stand-up Comedy","Speech Content","Augmented Matrix","Augmented Matrices","Punchline","Bigraph","Link Graph","Interactive","Rectangular","Rectangle","Audience","Laughter","Laugh","Temporal Information","Semantic Similarity","Semantic Relatedness","Design Requirements","Verb Phrase","Spam Emails","Bulk Email","Unsolicited Emails","Word Usage","User Interviews","Italian Community","Concrete Concepts","Speech Level","Word Pairs","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Domain Experts"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3127132","title":"NeuRegenerate: A Framework for Visualizing Neurodegeneration","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"2160-9306","rank":92,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086546371","id":37086546371,"full_name":"Saeed Boorboor","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088456400","id":37088456400,"full_name":"Shawn Mathew","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086546781","id":37086546781,"full_name":"Mala Ananth","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37269512100","id":37269512100,"full_name":"David Talmage","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086546468","id":37086546468,"full_name":"Lorna W.

However, due to the limitation that biological specimens can only be imaged at a single timepoint, studying changes to neural projections over time is limited to observations gathered using population analysis. In this article, we introduce NeuRegenerate, a novel end-to-end framework for the prediction and visualization of changes in neural fiber morphology within a subject across specified age-timepoints. To predict projections, we present neuReGANerator, a deep-learning network based on cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (GAN) that translates features of neuronal structures across age-timepoints for large brain microscopy volumes. We improve the reconstruction quality of the predicted neuronal structures by implementing a density multiplier and a new loss function, called the hallucination loss. Moreover, to alleviate artifacts that occur due to tiling of large input volumes, we introduce a spatial-consistency module in the training pipeline of neuReGANerator. Finally, to visualize the change in projections, predicted using neuReGANerator, NeuRegenerate offers two modes: (i) neuroCompare to simultaneously visualize the difference in the structures of the neuronal projections, from two age domains (using structural view and bounded view), and (ii) neuroMorph, a vesselness-based morphing technique to interactively visualize the transformation of the structures from one age-timepoint to the other. Our framework is designed specifically for volumes acquired using wide-field microscopy. We demonstrate our framework by visualizing the structural changes within the cholinergic system of the mouse brain between a young and old specimen.","article_number":"9610985","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9610985","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9610985/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9610985/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10032251,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"1 March 2023","start_page":"1625","end_page":"1637","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":540,"insert_date":"20211110","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Microscopy","Data visualization","Image reconstruction","Visualization","Neurites","Training","Three-dimensional displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Neuron visualization","volume visualization","volume transformation","wide-field microscopy","machine learning"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Loss Function","Morphological Changes","Generative Adversarial Networks","Fiber Morphology","Interactive Visualization","Wide-field Microscope","Neuronal Structures","Prediction Framework","Cholinergic System","Input Volume","Visualization Of Changes","Advances In Microscopy","Neural Projections","Brain Regions","Neuroscience","Intensity Values","Neurite","Deep Learning Models","Progressive Changes","Fiber Density","Volume Rendering","Raw Volume","Change Projections","Microscopy Data","Spatial Consistency","Cholinergic Fibers","Cycle Consistency Loss","Medial Septum","Discrete Time Points","Tile Size"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3169175","title":"GestureLens: Visual Analysis of Gestures in Presentation Videos","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"8","issn":"2160-9306","rank":93,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085732774","id":37085732774,"full_name":"Haipeng Zeng","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101987","id":37087101987,"full_name":"Xingbo Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"Singapore Management University, Singapore","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089654484","id":37089654484,"full_name":"Yong Wang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Singapore Management University, Singapore"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086808853","id":37086808853,"full_name":"Aoyu Wu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086924787","id":37086924787,"full_name":"Ting-Chuen Pong","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Appropriate gestures can enhance message delivery and audience engagement in both daily communication and public presentations.

Specifically, the exploration view enables users to obtain a quick overview of the spatial and temporal distributions of gestures. The dynamic hand movements are firstly aggregated through a heatmap in the gesture space for uncovering spatial patterns, and then decomposed into two mutually perpendicular timelines for revealing temporal patterns. The relation view allows users to explicitly explore the correlation between speech content and gestures by enabling linked analysis and intuitive glyph designs. The video view and dynamic view show the context and overall dynamic movement of the selected gestures, respectively.

This article attacks this problem without altering the original RadViz design: It defines, for both a single point and a set of points, the metric of effectiveness error, and uses it to define the objective function of a dimension arrangement strategy, arguing that minimizing it increases the overall RadViz visual quality. This article investigated the intuition that reducing the effectiveness error is beneficial for other well-known RadViz problems, like points clumping toward the center, many-to-one plotting of non-proportional points, and cluster separation. It presents an algorithm that reduces to zero the effectiveness error for a single point and a heuristic that approximates the dimension arrangement minimizing the effectiveness error for an arbitrary set of points. A set of experiments based on 21 real datasets has been performed, with the goals of analyzing the advantages of reducing the effectiveness error, comparing the proposed dimension arrangement strategy with other related proposals, and investigating the heuristic accuracy. The Effectiveness Error metric, the algorithm, and the heuristic presented in this article have been made available in a d3.js plugin at https://aware-diag-sapienza.github.io/d3-radviz.","article_number":"9514468","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9514468","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9514468/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9514468/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9930678,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 Dec. 2022","start_page":"4770","end_page":"4786","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":328,"insert_date":"20210816","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Linear programming","Image color analysis","Heuristic algorithms","Statistical analysis","Measurement"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Dimensionality reduction","RadViz","dimension arrangement","visual quality metrics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Objective Function","Point Values","Multidimensional Data","Multidimensional Analysis","Anomaly Detection","Original Dimensions","Good Results","Good Outcome","ANOVA Test","Comparative Evaluation","Comparison Of Rates","Comparable Rates","User Study","First Quartile","Upper Quartile","Lower Quartile","Position Of Point","Point Distance","Value Dimensions","Optimal Placement","Optimal Arrangement","Central Problem","Error Metrics","Average Computation Time","Average Calculation Time","Distance In Order","Close Points","Zariski Closure","Dominant Dimension","Projection Error","Davies-Bouldin Index","Davies Bouldin Index","Relevant Forces","Cluttering","Type Of Test","Scoring Function","Compact Distribution","Overview Of Data","MacBook Pro"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3144975","title":"Visualizing the Scripts of Data Wrangling With Somnus","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":97,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089642631","id":37089642631,"full_name":"Kai Xiong","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085458481","id":37085458481,"full_name":"Siwei Fu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089825621","id":37089825621,"full_name":"Guoming Ding","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089640291","id":37089640291,"full_name":"Zhongsu Luo","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China","Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089825914","id":37089825914,"full_name":"Rong Yu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37291847800","id":37291847800,"full_name":"Wei Chen","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271755400","id":37271755400,"full_name":"Hujun Bao","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","id":37407308300,"full_name":"Yingcai Wu","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Data workers use various scripting languages for data transformation, such as SAS, R, and Python. However, understanding intricate code pieces requires advanced programming skills, which hinders data workers from grasping the idea of data transformation at ease. Program visualization is beneficial for debugging and education and has the potential to illustrate transformations intuitively and interactively. In this article, we explore visualization design for demonstrating the semantics of code pieces in the context of data transformation. First, to depict individual data transformations, we structure a design space by two primary dimensions, i.e., key parameters to encode and possible visual channels to be mapped. Then, we derive a collection of 23 glyphs that visualize the semantics of transformations. Next, we design a pipeline, named Somnus, that provides an overview of the creation and evolution of data tables using a provenance graph. At the same time, it allows detailed investigation of individual transformations. User feedback on Somnus is positive. Our study participants achieved better accuracy with less time using Somnus, and preferred it over carefully-crafted textual description. Further, we provide two example applications to demonstrate the utility and versatility of Somnus.","article_number":"9693232","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9693232","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9693232/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9693232/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10115225,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"1 June 2023","start_page":"2950","end_page":"2964","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":570,"insert_date":"20220125","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Codes","Semantics","Visualization","Debugging","Python","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Program understanding","data transformation","visualization design"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Wrangling","DataWrangler","Data Munging","Data Transformation","Design Space","Textual Descriptions","Debugging","Visual Design","Primary Dimensions","Visual Channels","Piece Of Code","Function Parameters","Programming Language","Visual Representation","Transformation Process","General Types","Output Function","Yield Function","R Function","Image Descriptors","Visual Description","Type Of Transformation","Program Execution","Real-world Case","Output Table","Series Of Transformations","Usage Of Functions","Conditional Statements","Function Name","Column In Order","Usage Scenarios","Panel Of Table"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3163349","title":"Geometry-Aware Merge Tree Comparisons for Time-Varying Data With Interleaving Distances","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"8","issn":"2160-9306","rank":98,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Scientific Computing & Imaging (SCI) Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102230","id":37087102230,"full_name":"Lin Yan","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Scientific Computing & Imaging (SCI) Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Science and Technology, Linköping University, Norrköping, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087382387","id":37087382387,"full_name":"Talha Bin Masood","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Science and Technology, Linköping University, Norrköping, Sweden"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Science and Technology, Linköping University, Norrköping, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089637946","id":37089637946,"full_name":"Farhan Rasheed","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Science and Technology, Linköping University, Norrköping, Sweden"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Science and Technology, Linköping University, Norrköping, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282721800","id":37282721800,"full_name":"Ingrid Hotz","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Science and Technology, Linköping University, Norrköping, Sweden"]}},{"affiliation":"Scientific Computing & Imaging (SCI) Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38025846900","id":38025846900,"full_name":"Bei Wang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Scientific Computing & Imaging (SCI) Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Merge trees, a type of topological descriptors, serve to identify and summarize the topological characteristics associated with scalar fields. They have great potential for analyzing and visualizing time-varying data. First, they give compressed and topology-preserving representations of data instances. Second, their comparisons provide a basis for studying the relations among data instances, such as their distributions, clusters, outliers, and periodicities. A number of comparative measures have been developed for merge trees. However, these measures are often computationally expensive since they implicitly consider all possible correspondences between critical points of the merge trees. In this paper, we perform geometry-aware comparisons of merge trees using labeled interleaving distances. The main idea is to decouple the computation of a comparative measure into two steps: a labeling step that generates a correspondence between the critical points of two merge trees, and a comparison step that computes distances between a pair of labeled merge trees by encoding them as matrices. We show that our approach is general, computationally efficient, and practically useful. Our framework makes it possible to integrate geometric information of the data domain in the labeling process. At the same time, the framework reduces the computational complexity since not all possible correspondences have to be considered. We demonstrate via experiments that such geometry-aware merge tree comparisons help to detect transitions, clusters, and periodicities of time-varying datasets, as well as to diagnose and highlight the topological changes between adjacent data instances.","article_number":"9744472","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9744472","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9744472/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9744472/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10168673,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"1 Aug. 2023","start_page":"3489","end_page":"3506","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":349,"insert_date":"20220329","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Labeling","Measurement","Data visualization","Geometry","Encoding","Data analysis","Visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Merge trees","merge tree metrics","topological data analysis","topology in visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Comparison Of Trees","Comparative Tree","Merging Algorithm","Merge Tree","Time-varying Data","Critical Point","Topological Changes","Geometric Information","Data Instances","Instantaneous Data","Labeling Process","Topological Indices","Topological Index","Topological Descriptors","Labeling Step","Time Step","Distance Matrix","Distance Matrices","Time Instants","Structural Transition","Labeling Strategy","Labeling Scheme","Mapping Strategy","Mapping Scheme","Topological Information","Matrix Of Pairwise Distances","Pairwise Distance Matrices","Treemap","Functional Tree","Performance Of Trees","Edit Distance","Points In Domain","Pairs Of Trees","Stable Manifold","Sublevel Set","Superlevel Sets","Orange Squares","Joining Tree","Junction Tree","Tree-decomposition","Pair Of Vertices","Vertex Pairs","Flow Dataset","Flow Data Sets","Scikit-learn Python Library","Edit Operations"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3133592","title":"Nanotilus: Generator of Immersive Guided-Tours in Crowded 3D Environments","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"2160-9306","rank":99,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Saudi Arabia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656884","id":37088656884,"full_name":"Ruwayda Alharbi","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"]}},{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Saudi Arabia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656920","id":37088656920,"full_name":"Ondřej Strnad","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Wien, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088549862","id":37088549862,"full_name":"Laura R.

When reaching very high structural densities, the natural depiction of the scene produces impenetrable clutter and requires visibility and occlusion management strategies for exploration and orientation. Strategies developed to address the crowdedness in desktop applications, however, inhibit the feeling of immersion. They result in nonimmersive, desktop-style outside-in viewing in virtual reality. This article proposes Nanotilus—a new visibility and guidance approach for very dense environments that generates an endoscopic inside-out experience instead of outside-in viewing, preserving the immersive aspect of virtual reality. The approach consists of two novel, tightly coupled mechanisms that control scene sparsification simultaneously with camera path planning. The sparsification strategy is localized around the camera and is realized as a multi-scale, multi-shell, variety-preserving technique. When Nanotilus dives into the structures to capture internal details residing on multiple scales, it guides the camera using depth-based path planning. In addition to sparsification and path planning, we complete the tour generation with an animation controller, textual annotation, and text-to-visualization conversion. We demonstrate the generated guided tours on mesoscopic biological models – SARS-CoV-2 and HIV. We evaluate the Nanotilus experience with a baseline outside-in sparsification and navigational technique in a formal user study with 29 participants. While users can maintain a better overview using the outside-in sparsification, the study confirms our hypothesis that Nanotilus leads to stronger engagement and immersion.","article_number":"9645360","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9645360","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9645360/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9645360/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10032251,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"1 March 2023","start_page":"1860","end_page":"1875","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1330,"insert_date":"20211209","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Solid modeling","Nanobioscience","Biological system modeling","Three-dimensional displays","Navigation","Cameras","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["VR immersive","visibility management","path planning","storytelling","visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Navigation","User Study","Path Planning","Motion Planning","Immersive Environment","Immersive Virtual Reality","Ellipsoid","Supplementary Material Online","Directed Acyclic Graph","Immersive Experience","Camera Position","Camera Locations","Blue Triangles","Green Triangles","Route Planning","Travel Plans","Void Space","Head-mounted Display","Automatic Generation","Dijkstra’s Algorithm","Dijkstra Algorithm","Model Instances","Instantaneous Model","Virtual Reality Headset","Virtual Reality Head-mounted Display","VR Headset","Shell Elements","Yellow Triangle","Camera Rotation","Camera Movement","Shell Size","Intermediate Scale","Position Of Point","3D Position","3D Location","Storytelling","Inner Shell","Inner-shell","Molecular Modeling"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3219232","title":"Visual Exploration of Machine Learning Model Behavior With Hierarchical Surrogate Rule Sets","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":100,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"New York University, New York, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089169023","id":37089169023,"full_name":"Jun Yuan","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University, New York, NY, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Capital One, McLean, VA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089237382","id":37089237382,"full_name":"Brian Barr","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Capital One, McLean, VA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Capital One, McLean, VA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089638446","id":37089638446,"full_name":"Kyle Overton","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Capital One, McLean, VA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38267713800","id":38267713800,"full_name":"Enrico Bertini","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"One of the potential solutions for model interpretation is to train a surrogate model: a more transparent model that approximates the behavior of the model to be explained. Typically, classification rules or decision trees are used due to their logic-based expressions. However, decision trees can grow too deep, and rule sets can become too large to approximate a complex model. Unlike paths on a decision tree that must share ancestor nodes (conditions), rules are more flexible. However, the unstructured visual representation of rules makes it hard to make inferences across rules. In this paper, we focus on tabular data and present novel algorithmic and interactive solutions to address these issues. First, we present Hierarchical Surrogate Rules (HSR), an algorithm that generates hierarchical rules based on user-defined parameters. We also contribute SuRE, a visual analytics (VA) system that integrates HSR and an interactive surrogate rule visualization, the Feature-Aligned Tree, which depicts rules as trees while aligning features for easier comparison. We evaluate the algorithm in terms of parameter sensitivity, time performance, and comparison with surrogate decision trees and find that it scales reasonably well and overcomes the shortcomings of surrogate decision trees. We evaluate the visualization and the system through a usability study and an observational study with domain experts. Our investigation shows that the participants can use feature-aligned trees to perform non-trivial tasks with very high accuracy. We also discuss many interesting findings, including a rule analysis task characterization, that can be used for visualization design and future research.","article_number":"9937064","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9937064","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9937064/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9937064/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10379475,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Feb. 2024","start_page":"1470","end_page":"1488","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":442,"insert_date":"20221103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Decision trees","Data models","Behavioral sciences","Analytical models","Predictive models","Feature extraction","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","rule set","surrogate model","model understanding"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Set Of Rules","Hierarchical Set","Hierarchical Rules","Observational Studies","Population-based Study","Alternative Models","Surrogate Model","Behavioral Model","Decision Tree","Visual Representation","Visual Analysis","Domain Experts","Interactive Visualization","Visual Design","Interaction Rules","Training Set","Random Forest","Hierarchical Structure","Hierarchical Organization","High Coverage","Graphical Representation","Cover Data","Tree Structure","Interpretation Of Rules","Tree Visualization","Level Of Rules","Selection Rules","Procedure Of Algorithm","Forest Trees","Complex Datasets","Visualization Techniques","Minimum Coverage","Dry Bean"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3110663","title":"Persistence Cycles for Visual Exploration of Persistent Homology","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":101,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Computing, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085457927","id":37085457927,"full_name":"Federico Iuricich","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computing, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Persistent homology is a fundamental tool in topological data analysis used for the most diverse applications.

Like its namesake, Hans Rosling (1948–2017), a professor of public health and a spellbinding public speaker, Roslingifier turns a sequence of entities changing over time—such as countries and continents with their demographic data—into an engaging narrative elling the story of the data. This data-driven storytelling method with an in-person presenter is a new genre of storytelling technique and has never been studied before. In this article, we aim to define a design space for this new genre—data presentation—and provide a semi-automated authoring tool for helping presenters create quality presentations. From an in-depth analysis of video clips of presentations using interactive visualizations, we derive three specific techniques to achieve this: natural language narratives, visual effects that highlight events, and temporal branching that changes playback time of the animation. Our implementation of the Roslingifier method is capable of identifying and clustering significant movements, automatically generating visual highlighting and a narrative for playback, and enabling the user to customize. From two user studies, we show that Roslingifier allows users to effectively create engaging data stories and the system features help both presenters and viewers find diverse insights.","article_number":"9695173","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9695173","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9695173/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9695173/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10115225,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"1 June 2023","start_page":"2980","end_page":"2995","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":918,"insert_date":"20220127","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Annotations","Visual effects","Streaming media","Organizations","Natural languages"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data-driven storytelling","narrative visualization","hans rosling","gapminder","trendalyzer"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Continent","Natural Language","User Study","Visual Effects","Visual Events","Public Speaking","Oral Presentations","Public Speech","Guest Speakers","Design Space","Interactive Visualization","Professor Of Public Health","Lifespan","Longevity","Life Span","Life Expectancy","Gestures","Time Series Data","Time-series Data","Clustering Algorithm","Start Time","Visualization Tool","Default Mode","Event Detection","Multidimensional Data","Multidimensional Analysis","Supplementary Material Online","Convex Hull","Line Chart","Cluster Labels","Mean Shift Algorithm","Pitch Control","Playback Speed","Linear Sequence","Presentation Style","Visual Narrative","Story Events","Weather Reports","Bubble Size"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3189883","title":"Automatic Scatterplot Design Optimization for Clustering Identification","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"10","issn":"2160-9306","rank":103,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086556695","id":37086556695,"full_name":"Ghulam Jilani Quadri","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088872643","id":37088872643,"full_name":"Jennifer Adorno Nieves","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Psychology, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089941665","id":37089941665,"full_name":"Brenton M.

Compelling scatterplot visualizations improve understanding of data by leveraging visual perception to boost awareness when performing specific visual analytic tasks. Design choices in scatterplots, such as graphical encodings or data aspects, can directly impact decision-making quality for low-level tasks like clustering. Hence, constructing frameworks that consider both the perceptions of the visual encodings and the task being performed enables optimizing visualizations to maximize efficacy. In this article, we propose an automatic tool to optimize the design factors of scatterplots to reveal the most salient cluster structure. Our approach leverages the merge tree data structure to identify the clusters and optimize the choice of subsampling algorithm, sampling rate, marker size, and marker opacity used to generate a scatterplot image. We validate our approach with user and case studies that show it efficiently provides high-quality scatterplot designs from a large parameter space.","article_number":"9826389","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9826389","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9826389/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9826389/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10237330,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"1 Oct. 2023","start_page":"4312","end_page":"4327","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":551,"insert_date":"20220711","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Task analysis","Encoding","Data visualization","Clustering algorithms","Design optimization","Image color analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Scatterplot","overdraw","clustering","design optimization","perception","topological data analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Design Optimization","Automatic Optimization","Sampling Rate","User Study","Visual Task","Cluster Structure","Design Choices","Merging Algorithm","Merge Tree","Visual Encoding","Computation Time","Calculation Time","Random Sampling","Similar Shape","Similar Figure","Similar Geometry","Relative Density","Specific Gravity","Dense Regions","Number Of Data Points","Spatial Separation","Perceptual Similarity","Visual Aspects","Manual Approach","Bar Length","Topological Data Analysis","Low Salience","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Measure Of Salience","Different Numbers Of Clusters","Cluster Count","MNIST Dataset","Abalone","Swiss Roll"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3223399","title":"DMT-EV: An Explainable Deep Network for Dimension Reduction","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"2160-9306","rank":104,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"AI Division, School of Engineering, Westlake University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089303840","id":37089303840,"full_name":"Zelin Zang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["AI Division, School of Engineering, Westlake University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"]}},{"affiliation":"AI Division, School of Engineering, Westlake University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085387617","id":37085387617,"full_name":"Shenghui Cheng","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["AI Division, School of Engineering, Westlake University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"]}},{"affiliation":"AI Division, School of Engineering, Westlake University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/976922539312839","id":976922539312839,"full_name":"Hanchen Xia","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["AI Division, School of Engineering, Westlake University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"]}},{"affiliation":"AI Division, School of Engineering, Westlake University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089326522","id":37089326522,"full_name":"Liangyu Li","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["AI Division, School of Engineering, Westlake University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"]}},{"affiliation":"AI Division, School of Engineering, Westlake University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/939814690808141","id":939814690808141,"full_name":"Yaoting Sun","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["AI Division, School of Engineering, Westlake University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"]}},{"affiliation":"AI Division, School of Engineering, Westlake University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086319576","id":37086319576,"full_name":"Yongjie Xu","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["AI Division, School of Engineering, Westlake University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Alibaba Group, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088215711","id":37088215711,"full_name":"Lei Shang","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Alibaba Group, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Alibaba Group, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088213535","id":37088213535,"full_name":"Baigui Sun","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Alibaba Group, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"AI Division, School of Engineering, Westlake University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279611000","id":37279611000,"full_name":"Stan Z.

It is used in various applications, such as image recognition, single-cell sequencing analysis, and biomarker discovery. However, contemporary parametric-free and parametric DR techniques suffer from several significant shortcomings, such as the inability to preserve global and local features and the poor generalisation performance. On the other hand, regarding explainability, it is crucial to comprehend the embedding process, especially the contribution of each part to the embedding process, while understanding how each feature affects the embedding results that identify critical components and help diagnose the embedding process. To address these problems, we have developed a deep neural network method called DMT-EV, which provides not only excellent performance in structural maintainability but also explainability to the DR therein. DMT-EV starts with data augmentation and a manifold-based loss function to improve embedding performance. The explanation is based on saliency maps and aims to examine the trained DMT-EV parameters and contributions of components during the embedding process. The proposed techniques are integrated with a visual interface to help the user to adjust DMT-EV to achieve better DR performance and explainability. The interactive visual interface makes it easier to illustrate the data features, compare different DR techniques, and investigate DR. An in-depth experimental comparison shows that DMT-EV consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both performance measures and explainability.","article_number":"9956753","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9956753","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9956753/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9956753/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10416827,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"March 2024","start_page":"1710","end_page":"1727","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1227,"insert_date":"20221121","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Data models","Parametric statistics","Manifolds","Biological system modeling","Sun","Predictive models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Dimension reduction","explainability of DR models","deep learning","parametric model"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Dimensionality Reduction","Loss Function","Loss-of-function","Neural Network","Characteristics Of Data","Features Of Data","Excellent Performance","Data Augmentation","Interfacial Interaction","Trainable Parameters","Low-dimensional Space","Lower-dimensional Space","Saliency Map","Embedding Process","Model Parameters","Important Characteristics","Feature Importance","Local Area","Local Structure","Image Dataset","Latent Space","Embedding Space","Visual Methods","In-depth Exploration","Dimensionality Reduction Methods","Local Explanations","MNIST Dataset","Output Embedding","Gate Layer","Noisy Features","Clustering Performance","Biological Datasets","Redundant Features","Expert Interviews","Local Preservation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3158236","title":"Scientometric Analysis of Interdisciplinary Collaboration and Gender Trends in 30 Years of IEEE VIS Publications","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"7","issn":"2160-9306","rank":105,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591344300","id":37591344300,"full_name":"Ali Sarvghad","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089849172","id":37089849172,"full_name":"Rolando Franqui-Nadal","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38275513600","id":38275513600,"full_name":"Rebecca Reznik-Zellen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089849461","id":37089849461,"full_name":"Ria Chawla","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591344800","id":37591344800,"full_name":"Narges Mahyar","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present the results of a scientometric analysis of 30 years of IEEE VIS publications between 1990-2020, in which we conducted a multifaceted analysis of interdisciplinary collaboration and gender composition among authors. To this end, we curated BiblioVIS, a bibliometric dataset that contains rich metadata about IEEE VIS publications, including 3032 articles and 6113 authors. One of the main factors differentiating BiblioVIS from similar datasets is the authors’ gender and discipline data, which we inferred through iterative rounds of computational and manual processes. Our analysis shows that, by and large, inter-institutional and interdisciplinary collaboration has been steadily growing over the past 30 years. However, interdisciplinary research was mainly between a few fields, including Computer Science, Engineering and Technology, and Medicine and Health disciplines. Our analysis of gender shows steady growth in women's authorship. Despite this growth, the gender distribution is still highly skewed, with men dominating ($\\approx$≈ 75%) of this space. Our predictive analysis of gender balance shows that if the current trends continue, gender parity in the visualization field will not be reached before the third quarter of the century ($\\approx$≈ 2070). Our primary goal in this work is to call the visualization community's attention to the critical topics of collaboration, diversity, and gender. Our research offers critical insights through the lens of diversity and gender to help accelerate progress towards a more diverse and representative research community.","article_number":"9733942","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9733942","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9733942/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9733942/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10137340,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"1 July 2023","start_page":"3340","end_page":"3353","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":440,"insert_date":"20220314","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Collaboration","Data visualization","Conferences","Bibliometrics","Market research","Visual analytics","Productivity"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Co-authorship","collaboration","gender","IEEE VIS publications","inter-institutional","interdisciplinary","scientometric"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Year Of Publication","Interdisciplinary Collaboration","Collaborative Analysis","Scientometric Analysis","Gender Trends","Research Community","Prediction Analysis","Computer Science","Interdisciplinary Research","Interdisciplinary Work","Interdisciplinary Studies","Computer Technology","Computer Engineering","Gender Balance","Gender Analysis","Health Disciplines","Gender Parity","Increase In The Number","Network Analysis","Gender Identity","Sexual Identity","Gender Minority","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Growth In The Number","Number Of Authors","Team Size","Name Of Author","Co-authorship Network","Gender Information","Vision Research","Computer Graphics","Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average","ARIMAX","ARIMA","Gender Binary","Gender Classification","Gender Categories","Collaboration Patterns"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3214420","title":"Deep Hierarchical Super Resolution for Scientific Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":106,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089374492","id":37089374492,"full_name":"Skylar W.

Our method combines three novel components: (1) a work donation algorithm, (2) a high-order workload estimation model, and (3) a communication cost model. First, we design an RL-based work donation algorithm. Our algorithm monitors workloads of processes and creates RL agents to donate data blocks and particles from high-workload processes to low-workload processes to minimize program execution time. The agents learn the donation strategy on the fly based on reward and cost functions designed to consider processes’ workload changes and data transfer costs of donation actions. Second, we propose a workload estimation model, helping RL agents estimate the workload distribution of processes in future computations. Third, we design a communication cost model that considers both block and particle data exchange costs, helping RL agents make effective decisions with minimized communication costs. We demonstrate that our algorithm adapts to different flow behaviors in large-scale fluid dynamics, ocean, and weather simulation data. Our algorithm improves parallel particle tracing performance in terms of parallel efficiency, load balance, and costs of I/O and communication for evaluations with up to 16,384 processors.","article_number":"9706326","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9706326","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9706326/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9706326/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10115225,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"1 June 2023","start_page":"3052","end_page":"3066","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":321,"insert_date":"20220207","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Costs","Heuristic algorithms","Estimation","Load modeling","Data models","Computational modeling","Adaptation models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Distributed and parallel particle tracing","dynamic load balancing","reinforcement learning"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Load Balancing","Tracer Particles","Model Estimates","Cost Function","Fluid Dynamics","Data Transfer","Cost Model","Reward Function","Communication Cost","Data Block","Higher-order Model","High-order Model","Reinforcement Learning Agent","Parallel Efficiency","Changes In Workload","Linear Model","Linear Regression Model","Flow Analysis","Vector Field","Steady Flow","Unsteady Flow","Particle Trajectories","Workload Balance","Balanced Workloads","Latent Function","Incoming Particles","Total Execution Time","High Performance Computing Cluster","High-performance Computing Cluster","Local Cost","Strong Scaling","Load Imbalance","Message Passing Interface","Message-Passing Interface","Maximum Workload"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3163727","title":"SD2: Slicing and Dicing Scholarly Data for Interactive Evaluation of Academic Performance","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"8","issn":"2160-9306","rank":109,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Visiting Scholar at Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089891316","id":37089891316,"full_name":"Zhichun Guo","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visiting Scholar at Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University and National Supercomputer Center in Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086054207","id":37086054207,"full_name":"Jun Tao","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University and National Supercomputer Center in Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China","National Supercomputer Center in Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Data Science, Fudan University, Shanghai, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085387892","id":37085387892,"full_name":"Siming Chen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Data Science, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37371597200","id":37371597200,"full_name":"Nitesh V.

Camera views are created for individual segments and are used to determine local bending angles at each node by projecting them to 2D. The final embedding is generated by minimizing an energy function (the weights of which are user adjustable) based on branch length and the 2D angles, while avoiding intersections. The user can also interactively modify segment placement within the 2D embedding, and the overall embedding will update accordingly. A global to local interactive exploration is provided using hierarchical camera views that are created for subtrees within the structure.

A better understanding of the physics of the structures (especially large-scale structures) in shear flows will help explain a diverse range of physical phenomena and improve our capability of modeling more complex turbulence flows. Many efforts have been made in order to capture such structures; however, conventional methods have their limitations, such as arbitrariness in parameter choice or specificity to certain setups. To address this challenge, we propose to use Multi-Resolution Dynamic Mode Decomposition (mrDMD), for large-scale structure extraction in shear flows. In particular, we show that the slow motion DMD modes are able to reveal large-scale structures in shear flows that also have slow dynamics. In most cases, we find that the slowest DMD mode and its reconstructed flow can sufficiently capture the large-scale dynamics in the shear flows, which leads to a parameter-free strategy for large-scale structure extraction. Effective visualization of the large-scale structures can then be produced with the aid of the slowest DMD mode. To speed up the computation of mrDMD, we provide a fast GPU-based implementation. We also apply our method to some non-shear flows that need not behave quasi-linearly to demonstrate the limitation of our strategy of using the slowest DMD mode. For non-shear flows, we show that multiple modes from different levels of mrDMD may be needed to sufficiently characterize the flow behavior.","article_number":"9599597","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9599597","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9599597/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9599597/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10003072,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"1 Feb. 2023","start_page":"1531","end_page":"1544","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":395,"insert_date":"20211102","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Feature extraction","Vehicle dynamics","Three-dimensional displays","Visualization","Shape","Task analysis","Standards"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Flow visualization","shear flows","dynamic mode decomposition"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Shear Flow","Large-scale Structures","Large Scale Structure","Large-scale Extraction","Large Scale Extraction","Dynamic Mode Decomposition","Large-scale Coherent Structures","Turbulent Flow","Slow Mode","Eigenvalues","Dynamical","Time Evolution","Time-evolution","Reynolds Number","Singular Value Decomposition","Vector Field","Steady Flow","Unsteady Flow","Typical Flow","Fluid Mechanics","Unit Circle","Original Field","Fast Mode","Streamwise Direction","Proper Orthogonal Decomposition","Couette Flow","Wall-bounded Flows","3D Flow","Vortex Ring","Infinite Plate","QR Decomposition","QR Factorization","No-slip Condition","No-slip Boundary Condition","2D Data","Vortex Lines","Vortex Tubes"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3207147","title":"Team-Builder: Toward More Effective Lineup Selection in Soccer","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":114,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100739","id":37087100739,"full_name":"Anqi Cao","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086238864","id":37086238864,"full_name":"Ji Lan","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Sports Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086448603","id":37086448603,"full_name":"Xiao Xie","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Sports Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37293462900","id":37293462900,"full_name":"Hongyu Chen","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Information Sciences and Technology, Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547462","id":37086547462,"full_name":"Xiaolong Zhang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Information Sciences and Technology, Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Sports Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086236404","id":37086236404,"full_name":"Hui Zhang","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Sports Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","id":37407308300,"full_name":"Yingcai Wu","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Lineup selection is an essential and important task in soccer matches. To win a match, coaches must consider various factors and select appropriate players for a planned formation. Computation-based tools have been proposed to help coaches on this complex task, but they are usually based on over-simplified models on player performances, do not support interactive analysis, and overlook the inputs by coaches. In this article, we propose a method for visual analytics of soccer lineup selection by tackling two challenges: characterizing essential factors involved in generating optimal lineup, and supporting coach-driven visual analytics of lineup selection. We develop a lineup selection model that integrates such important factors, such as spatial regions of player actions and defensive interactions with opponent players. A visualization system, Team-Builder, is developed to help coaches control the process of lineup generation, explanation, and comparison through multiple coordinated views. The usefulness and effectiveness of our system are demonstrated by two case studies on a real-world soccer event dataset.","article_number":"9894103","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9894103","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9894103/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9894103/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10314810,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Dec. 2023","start_page":"5178","end_page":"5193","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":513,"insert_date":"20220916","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Sports","Data visualization","Analytical models","Trajectory","Computational modeling","Visual analytics","Videos"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Sports visualization","lineup selection","design study"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive","Visual System","Visual Analysis","Spatial Regions","Player Performance","Soccer Match","Individual Performance","Team Sports","Teammates","Basketball","Design Requirements","Usage Rate","Role-playing","Role Players","Blackbody","Blackbody Radiation","Team Performance","Team Functioning","Multiple Criteria","Matching Results","Match Outcome","Total Interaction","Group Of Indicators","Visual Design","Team Players","Defensive Tactics","Defensive Maneuvers","Selection Of Players","Multi-criteria Decision-making Problems","Player Value","Characteristics Of Sports","Sports Features","Defensive Actions","Interactive Tool","Soccer Ball","Top Team","Bar Charts"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3093585","title":"Interpretable Anomaly Detection in Event Sequences via Sequence Matching and Visual Comparison","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":115,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University, Shanghai, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547434","id":37086547434,"full_name":"Shunan Guo","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University, Shanghai, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547579","id":37086547579,"full_name":"Zhuochen Jin","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University, Shanghai, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085471103","id":37085471103,"full_name":"Qing Chen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"]}},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601397400","id":37601397400,"full_name":"David Gotz","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"East China Normal University, Shanghai, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271683100","id":37271683100,"full_name":"Hongyuan Zha","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University, Shanghai, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604309600","id":37604309600,"full_name":"Nan Cao","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Anomaly detection is a common analytical task that aims to identify rare cases that differ from the typical cases that make up the majority of a dataset. When analyzing event sequence data, the task of anomaly detection can be complex because the sequential and temporal nature of such data results in diverse definitions and flexible forms of anomalies. This, in turn, increases the difficulty in interpreting detected anomalies. In this article, we propose a visual analytic approach for detecting anomalous sequences in an event sequence dataset via an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm based on Variational AutoEncoders. We further compare the anomalous sequences with their reconstructions and with the normal sequences through a sequence matching algorithm to identify event anomalies. A visual analytics system is developed to support interactive exploration and interpretations of anomalies through novel visualization designs that facilitate the comparison between anomalous sequences and normal sequences. Finally, we quantitatively evaluate the performance of our anomaly detection algorithm, demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through case studies, and report feedback collected from study participants.","article_number":"9468958","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9468958","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9468958/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9468958/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9930678,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 Dec. 2022","start_page":"4531","end_page":"4545","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1111,"insert_date":"20210630","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Anomaly detection","Data models","Data visualization","Task analysis","Sequential analysis","Anomaly detection"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Event sequences","visual analytics","anomaly detection"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Sequence Of Events","Visual Comparison","Anomaly Detection","Matching Sequences","Visual System","Visual Analysis","Common Tasks","Variational Autoencoder","Visual Design","Long Short-term Memory","Long Short Term Memory","LSTM","Latent Space","Embedding Space","Time Slot","Individual Sequences","Real-world Datasets","Real-world Data Sets","Medical Experts","Majority Of Sequences","Interactive Visualization","Cluster Nodes","Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy","Haemodiafiltration","Hemodiafiltration","Hemofiltration","Anomalous Events","Latent Vector","Types Of Anomalies","Anomaly Score","Matching Cost","Main Panel","Fentanyl Use","Anomaly Detection Methods","Anomaly Detection Method","Variational Autoencoder Model","Variational Auto Encoder Model","Distribution Of Sequences"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3134083","title":"GUCCI - Guided Cardiac Cohort Investigation of Blood Flow Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"2160-9306","rank":116,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Simulation and Graphics, University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085898826","id":37085898826,"full_name":"Monique Meuschke","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Simulation and Graphics, University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany","Department of Theoretical Computer Science, University of Jena, Jena, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37076923700","id":37076923700,"full_name":"Uli Niemann","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089509727","id":37089509727,"full_name":"Benjamin Behrendt","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Leipzig – Heart Centre, Leipzig, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38580444300","id":38580444300,"full_name":"Matthias Gutberlet","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Leipzig – Heart Centre, Leipzig, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Simulation and Graphics, University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37424645300","id":37424645300,"full_name":"Bernhard Preim","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Simulation and Graphics, University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Theoretical Computer Science, University of Jena, Jena, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085527253","id":37085527253,"full_name":"Kai Lawonn","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Theoretical Computer Science, University of Jena, Jena, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present the framework GUCCI (Guided Cardiac Cohort Investigation), which provides a guided visual analytics workflow to analyze cohort-based measured blood flow data in the aorta.

However, there is a lack of dedicated techniques that allow visual comparison of multiple data sets and defined cohorts, which is essential to characterize pathologies. GUCCI offers visual analytics techniques and novel visualization methods to guide the user through the comparison of predefined cohorts, such as healthy volunteers and patients with a pathologically altered aorta. The combination of overview and glyph-based depictions together with statistical cohort-specific information allows investigating differences and similarities of the time-dependent data.

The STF’s justices frequently cite the 58 existing BPs in their decisions, and it is of primary relevance that judicial experts could identify and analyze such citations. To assist in this problem, we propose LegalVis, a web-based visual analytics system designed to support the analysis of legal documents that cite or could potentially cite a BP. We model the problem of identifying potential citations (i.e., non-explicit) as a classification problem. However, a simple score is not enough to explain the results; that is why we use an interpretability machine learning method to explain the reason behind each identified citation. For a compelling visual exploration of documents and BPs, LegalVis comprises three interactive visual components: the first presents an overview of the data showing temporal patterns, the second allows filtering and grouping relevant documents by topic, and the last one shows a document’s text aiming to interpret the model’s output by pointing out which paragraphs are likely to mention the BP, even if not explicitly specified. We evaluated our identification model and obtained an accuracy of 96%; we also made a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the results. The usefulness and effectiveness of LegalVis were evaluated through two usage scenarios and feedback from six domain experts.","article_number":"9716779","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9716779","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9716779/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9716779/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10115225,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"1 June 2023","start_page":"3105","end_page":"3120","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":551,"insert_date":"20220218","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Law","Data visualization","Visual analytics","Task analysis","Text analysis","Analytical models","Natural language processing"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Legal documents","visual analytics","Brazilian legal system","natural language processing"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Precedent","Legal Documentation","Machine Learning","Justice","Visual Analysis","Domain Experts","Expert Witness","Expert Evidence","Expert Information","Expert Sources","Visual Components","Usage Scenarios","High-dimensional","High-dimensional Space","Support Vector Machine","Machine Learning Models","Visualization Tool","Radial Basis Function","Cloud Data","Word Cloud","Sample Dataset","Global View","Topic Modeling","Potential Identification","Potential Design","Linear Kernel","Part Of Decision","Visual Analytics Tool","Raw Text","Relevant Decisions","Scope For Improvement","Linear Support Vector Machine","Linear SVM","Similar Decisions","Temporal Perspective","Regular Expressions","Regex","Search Engine","Searchable","Web Search"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3215001","title":"Principal Geodesic Analysis of Merge Trees (and Persistence Diagrams)","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":118,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"CNRS and Sorbonne Université, Paris, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089205699","id":37089205699,"full_name":"Mathieu Pont","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["CNRS and Sorbonne Université, Paris, France"]}},{"affiliation":"CNRS and Sorbonne Université, Paris, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102371","id":37087102371,"full_name":"Jules Vidal","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["CNRS and Sorbonne Université, Paris, France"]}},{"affiliation":"CNRS and Sorbonne Université, Paris, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37298870300","id":37298870300,"full_name":"Julien Tierny","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["CNRS and Sorbonne Université, Paris, France"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"This article presents a computational framework for the Principal Geodesic Analysis of merge trees (MT-PGA), a novel adaptation of the celebrated Principal Component Analysis (PCA) framework (K.

We formulate MT-PGA computation as a constrained optimization problem, aiming at adjusting a basis of orthogonal geodesic axes, while minimizing a fitting energy. We introduce an efficient, iterative algorithm which exploits shared-memory parallelism, as well as an analytic expression of the fitting energy gradient, to ensure fast iterations. Our approach also trivially extends to extremum persistence diagrams. Extensive experiments on public ensembles demonstrate the efficiency of our approach – with MT-PGA computations in the orders of minutes for the largest examples. We show the utility of our contributions by extending to merge trees two typical PCA applications. First, we apply MT-PGA to data reduction and reliably compress merge trees by concisely representing them by their first coordinates in the MT-PGA basis. Second, we present a dimensionality reduction framework exploiting the first two directions of the MT-PGA basis to generate two-dimensional layouts of the ensemble. We augment these layouts with persistence correlation views, enabling global and local visual inspections of the feature variability in the ensemble. In both applications, quantitative experiments assess the relevance of our framework. Finally, we provide a C++ implementation that can be used to reproduce our results.","article_number":"9920234","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9920234","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9920234/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9920234/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10003072,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"1 Feb. 2023","start_page":"1573","end_page":"1589","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":238,"insert_date":"20221017","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Measurement","Principal component analysis","Probability density function","Optimization","Uncertainty","Layout"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Topological data analysis","ensemble data","merge trees","persistence diagrams"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Merging Algorithm","Merge Tree","Persistence Diagram","Principal Geodesic Analysis","Dimensionality Reduction","Iterative Algorithm","Constrained Optimization Problem","Tree Space","C++ Implementation","Probability Density Function","Efficient Algorithm","Point Cloud","Point Clouds","Supplementary Material Online","Euclidean Space","Projection Point","Orthogonal Basis","Topological Indices","Topological Index","Topological Descriptors","Arbitrary Vector","Optimal Assignment","Geometric Complexity","Wasserstein Distance","Wasserstein Metric","Ensemble Clustering","Sublevel Set","Superlevel Sets","Topological Data Analysis","Update Phase","Compression Factor","Computational Role","Role In The Calculation","Blue Spheres","Schmidt Orthogonalization","Gram-Schmidt Process","Gram-Schmidt Method","Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization","Feature Tracking","Feature-tracking"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3190623","title":"Influence Maximization With Visual Analytics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"10","issn":"2160-9306","rank":119,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Centre for Visual Analytics Science and Technology, TU Wien, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086329678","id":37086329678,"full_name":"Alessio Arleo","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Centre for Visual Analytics Science and Technology, TU Wien, Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Engineering Department, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37299117200","id":37299117200,"full_name":"Walter Didimo","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Engineering Department, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy"]}},{"affiliation":"Engineering Department, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37299114700","id":37299114700,"full_name":"Giuseppe Liotta","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Engineering Department, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy"]}},{"affiliation":"Centre for Visual Analytics Science and Technology, TU Wien, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282584500","id":37282584500,"full_name":"Silvia Miksch","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Centre for Visual Analytics Science and Technology, TU Wien, Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Engineering Department, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37846763600","id":37846763600,"full_name":"Fabrizio Montecchiani","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Engineering Department, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy"]}}]},"access_type":"CCBY - IEEE is not the copyright holder of this material.

The popularity of online social networking platforms makes them the prime venues to advertise products and promote opinions. The Influence Maximization (IM) problem entails selecting a seed set of users that maximizes the influence spread, i.e., the expected number of users positively influenced by a stochastic diffusion process triggered by the seeds. Engineering and analyzing IM algorithms remains a difficult and demanding task due to the NP-hardness of the problem and the stochastic nature of the diffusion processes. Despite several heuristics being introduced, they often fail in providing enough information on how the network topology affects the diffusion process, precious insights that could help researchers improve their seed set selection. In this paper, we present VAIM, a visual analytics system that supports users in analyzing, evaluating, and comparing information diffusion processes determined by different IM algorithms. Furthermore, VAIM provides useful insights that the analyst can use to modify the seed set of an IM algorithm, so to improve its influence spread. We assess our system by: $(i)$(i) a qualitative evaluation based on a guided experiment with two domain experts on two different data sets; $(ii)$(ii) a quantitative estimation of the value of the proposed visualization through the ICE-T methodology by Wall et al. (IEEE TVCG - 2018). The twofold assessment indicates that VAIM effectively supports our target users in the visual analysis of the performance of IM algorithms.","article_number":"9829321","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9829321","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9829321/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9829321/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9874356,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 Oct. 2022","start_page":"3428","end_page":"3440","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1234,"insert_date":"20220713","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Diffusion processes","Social networking (online)","Data visualization","Analytical models","Visual analytics","Stochastic processes","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Information visualization","visualization systems and software","influence maximization","visual analytics","information diffusion"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Influence Maximization","Social Networks","Heuristic","Rule Of Thumb","Visual System","Network Topology","Diffusion Process","Dissemination Of Information","Information Diffusion","Domain Experts","Influence Spread","Influential Spreaders","Interactive","Running Time","Stochastic Model","Cell Matrix","Diffusion Model","Number Of Simulations","Density Matrix","Density Operator","Density Matrices","Understanding Of The Data","Core Network","Cell Nodes","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Portion Of Network","Diffusion Matrix","Diffusion Matrices","Large Graphs","Bitcoin","Graph Database","Viral Marketing","Viral Advertising","Viral Ads","Viral Ad","Co-authorship Network","Dynamic Graph"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3238008","title":"Discrete Morse Sandwich: Fast Computation of Persistence Diagrams for Scalar Data – An Algorithm and a Benchmark","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"4","issn":"2160-9306","rank":120,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"CNRS and Sorbonne Université, Paris, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086141721","id":37086141721,"full_name":"Pierre Guillou","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["CNRS and Sorbonne Université, Paris, France"]}},{"affiliation":"CNRS and Sorbonne Université, Paris, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102371","id":37087102371,"full_name":"Jules Vidal","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["CNRS and Sorbonne Université, Paris, France"]}},{"affiliation":"CNRS and Sorbonne Université, Paris, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37298870300","id":37298870300,"full_name":"Julien Tierny","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["CNRS and Sorbonne Université, Paris, France"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"This paper introduces an efficient algorithm for persistence diagram computation, given an input piecewise linear scalar field $f$f defined on a $d$d-dimensional simplicial complex $\\mathcal {K}$K, with $d \\leq 3$d≤3. Our work revisits the seminal algorithm “PairSimplices” (Edelsbrunner et al. 2002), (Zomorodian, 2010) with discrete Morse theory (DMT) (Forman, 1998), (Robins et al. 2011), which greatly reduces the number of input simplices to consider. Further, we also extend to DMT and accelerate the stratification strategy described in “PairSimplices” (Edelsbrunner et al. 2002), (Zomorodian, 2010) for the fast computation of the $0^{th}$ and $(d-1)^{th}$(d-1)th diagrams, noted $\\mathcal {D}_{0}(f)$D0(f) and $\\mathcal {D}_{d-1}(f)$Dd-1(f). Minima-saddle persistence pairs ($\\mathcal {D}_{0}(f)$D0(f)) and saddle-maximum persistence pairs ($\\mathcal {D}_{d-1}(f)$Dd-1(f)) are efficiently computed by processing, with a Union-Find, the unstable sets of 1-saddles and the stable sets of $(d-1)$(d-1)-saddles. This fast pre-computation for the dimensions 0 and $(d-1)$(d-1) enables an aggressive specialization of (Bauer et al. 2014) to the 3D case, which results in a drastic reduction of the number of input simplices for the computation of $\\mathcal {D}_{1}(f)$D1(f), the intermediate layer of the sandwich. Finally, we document several performance improvements via shared-memory parallelism. We provide an open-source implementation of our algorithm for reproducibility purposes. Extensive experiments indicate that our algorithm improves by two orders of magnitude the time performance of the seminal “PairSimplices” algorithm it extends. Moreover, it also improves memory footprint and time performance over a selection of 14 competing approaches, with a substantial gain over the fastest available approaches, while producing a strictly identical output.","article_number":"10021892","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10021892","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10021892/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10021892/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10453005,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"April 2024","start_page":"1897","end_page":"1915","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":231,"insert_date":"20230119","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data mining","Feature extraction","Data visualization","Data analysis","Three-dimensional displays","Stars","Sea surface"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["discrete Morse theory","persistence diagrams","scalar data","Topological data analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Scalar Data","Persistence Diagram","Computational Algorithms","Calculation Algorithm","Simplicial Complex","Memory Footprint","Stable Set","Stratification Strategies","Stratification Scheme","Piecewise Linear","Data Visualization","Large Systems","Parallelization","Parallel Computing","Time Complexity","Regular Grid","Cartesian Grid","Grid Structure","Rectangular Grid","Supplementary Material Online","Computational Speed","Calculation Speed","General Representation","Global Order","Lexicographic","Lexicographic Order","Homology Groups","Homology Class","Topological Data Analysis","2D Datasets","Betti Numbers","Sublevel Set","Superlevel Sets","Discrete Field","Union Operation","Merging Algorithm","Merge Tree","Parallel Efficiency","Topological Data","Desktop Computer"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3184247","title":"EBBE-Text: Explaining Neural Networks by Exploring Text Classification Decision Boundaries","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"10","issn":"2160-9306","rank":121,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"LIRMM, CNRS, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/568051596986386","id":568051596986386,"full_name":"Alexis Delaforge","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["LIRMM, CNRS, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France"]}},{"affiliation":"LIRMM, CNRS, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37680421800","id":37680421800,"full_name":"Jérôme Azé","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["LIRMM, CNRS, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France"]}},{"affiliation":"LIRMM, AMIS research group of the Paul Valéry, CNRS, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37992236900","id":37992236900,"full_name":"Sandra Bringay","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["LIRMM, AMIS research group of the Paul Valéry, CNRS, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France"]}},{"affiliation":"ICM, IDESP, INSERM, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/441092188648762","id":441092188648762,"full_name":"Caroline Mollevi","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["ICM, IDESP, INSERM, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France"]}},{"affiliation":"LIRMM, AMIS research group of the Paul Valéry, CNRS, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38096820300","id":38096820300,"full_name":"Arnaud Sallaberry","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["LIRMM, AMIS research group of the Paul Valéry, CNRS, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France"]}},{"affiliation":"LIRMM, AMIS research group of the Paul Valéry, CNRS, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086141982","id":37086141982,"full_name":"Maximilien Servajean","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["LIRMM, AMIS research group of the Paul Valéry, CNRS, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"While neural networks (NN) have been successfully applied to many NLP tasks, the way they function is often difficult to interpret.

Compared to conventional methods that use hand-crafted feature descriptors, some recent studies focus on transforming the data into a new latent space, where features are easier to be identified, compared and extracted. However, it is challenging to transform particle data into latent representations, since the convolution neural networks used in prior studies require the data presented in regular grids. In this article, we adopt Geometric Convolution, a neural network building block designed for 3D point clouds, to create latent representations for scientific particle data. These latent representations capture both the particle positions and their physical attributes in the local neighborhood so that features can be extracted by clustering in the latent space, and tracked by applying tracking algorithms such as mean-shift. We validate the extracted features and tracking results from our approach using datasets from three applications and show that they are comparable to the methods that define hand-crafted features for each specific dataset.","article_number":"9735308","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9735308","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9735308/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9735308/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10137340,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"1 July 2023","start_page":"3354","end_page":"3367","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":253,"insert_date":"20220315","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Feature extraction","Neural networks","Point cloud compression","Data visualization","Convolution","Three-dimensional displays","Kernel"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data transformation","particle data","feature extraction and tracking","deep learning"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Latent Representation","Neural Network","Physical Properties","Convolutional Neural Network","Descriptive Characteristics","Feature Descriptors","Point Cloud","Regular Grid","Cartesian Grid","Grid Structure","Rectangular Grid","Latent Space","Embedding Space","Particle Position","Position Of Each Particle","3D Point Cloud","Tracking Results","Clusters In Space","Time Step","Hierarchical Clustering","Hierarchical Cluster Analysis","Interesting Feature","Interesting Characteristics","Physical Space","Root Node","Parent Node","Peak Signal-to-noise Ratio","PSNR","Inner Core","Topological Analysis","Feature Tracking","Latent Vector","Mean Shift Algorithm","Optimal Radius","Optimal Radii","Convolutional Neural Network Classifier","Gravitational Energy","Gravitational Potential Energy","t-SNE Projection","Dark Halo","Dark Matter Halo","Hierarchical View","Outer Core"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3205769","title":"ScrollyVis: Interactive Visual Authoring of Guided Dynamic Narratives for Scientific Scrollytelling","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":124,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37090078144","id":37090078144,"full_name":"Eric Mörth","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway","Mohn Medical Imaging and Visualization Centre, Department of Radiology, Haukeland Univerity Hospital, Bergen, Norway"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37265895700","id":37265895700,"full_name":"Stefan Bruckner","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway","Mohn Medical Imaging and Visualization Centre, Department of Radiology, Haukeland Univerity Hospital, Bergen, Norway"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085904230","id":37085904230,"full_name":"Noeska N.

Scrollytelling is a recent visual storytelling technique extensively used on the web, where content appears or changes as users scroll up or down a page. By employing the familiar gesture of scrolling as its primary interaction mechanism, it provides users with a sense of control, exploration and discoverability while still offering a simple and intuitive interface. In this article, we present a novel approach for authoring, editing, and presenting data-driven scientific narratives using scrollytelling. Our method flexibly integrates common sources such as images, text, and video, but also supports more specialized visualization techniques such as interactive maps as well as scalar field and mesh data visualizations. We show that scrolling navigation can be used to traverse dynamic narratives and demonstrate how it can be combined with interactive parameter exploration. The resulting system consists of an extensible web-based authoring tool capable of exporting stand-alone stories that can be hosted on any web server. We demonstrate the power and utility of our approach with case studies from several diverse scientific fields and with a user study including 12 participants of diverse professional backgrounds. Furthermore, an expert in creating interactive articles assessed the usefulness of our approach and the quality of the created stories.","article_number":"9887905","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9887905","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9887905/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9887905/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10314810,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Dec. 2023","start_page":"5165","end_page":"5177","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1306,"insert_date":"20220912","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Media","Motion pictures","Authoring systems","Writing","Web servers"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive Visualization","Data Visualization","Web Server","Storytelling","Locus Of Control","Sense Of Control","Visualization Techniques","Diverse Professional Backgrounds","Variety Of Professional Backgrounds","Root Node","Parent Node","Types Of Media","PhD Students","Part Of The Story","Types Of Nodes","Current Node","Visual Exploration","System Usability Scale","Web Development","Medical Physics","Scrolling","Decision Node","Chance Nodes","Map View","Volume Rendering","Volumetric Rendering","Zoom Level","Successive Nodes","Camera Rotation","Candidate In The Field","Present Stories","Blog Posts","Item Content"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3152515","title":"View Composition Algebra for Ad Hoc Comparison","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":125,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Columbia University, New York, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086545135","id":37086545135,"full_name":"Eugene Wu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Comparison is a core task in visual analysis.

The segmentation of the domain into ascending and descending manifolds, solely defined on the vertices, improves the computational time using path compression and fully segments the border region. Region boundaries and region separators are generated using a multi-label marching tetrahedra algorithm. This enables a fast and simple solution to find optimal parameter settings in preliminary exploration steps by generating an MS complex preview. It also poses a rapid option to generate a fast visual representation of the region geometries for immediate utilization. Two experiments demonstrate the performance of our approach with speedups of over an order of magnitude in comparison to two publicly available implementations.

As such the derived static causal networks do not take into account the effect of time as an indicator. However, knowing the time delay of a causal relation can be crucial as it instructs how and when actions should be taken. Yet, similar to static causality, deriving causal relations from observational time-series data, as opposed to designed experiments, is not a straightforward process. It can greatly benefit from human insight to break ties and resolve errors. We hence propose a set of visual analytics methods that allow humans to participate in the discovery of causal relations associated with windows of time delay. Specifically, we leverage a well-established method, logic-based causality, to enable analysts to test the significance of potential causes and measure their influences toward a certain effect. Furthermore, since an effect can be a cause of other effects, we allow users to aggregate different temporal cause-effect relations found with our method into a visual flow diagram to enable the discovery of temporal causal networks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods we constructed a prototype system named DOMINO and showcase it via a number of case studies using real-world datasets. Finally, we also used DOMINO to conduct several evaluations with human analysts from different science domains in order to gain feedback on the utility of our system in practical scenarios.","article_number":"9895311","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9895311","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9895311/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9895311/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10314810,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Dec. 2023","start_page":"5342","end_page":"5356","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":383,"insert_date":"20220919","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Time series analysis","Delay effects","Task analysis","Visual systems","Testing","Prototypes"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Causality analysis","hypothesis generation","hypothesis testing","time series","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Causal Reasoning","Time Series","Causal Relationship","Causal Effect","Cause-and-effect","Cause-effect","Time Delay","Time Series Data","Visual Analysis","Temporal Relationship","Counterfactual","Causal Network","Human Analysts","Time Window","Expected Value","Air Pollution","Time Lag","Visual System","Causal Inference","User Study","Conditional Distribution","Distribution Of Status","Wind Direction","Causal Hypotheses","Causal Set","Granger Causality","Causal Graph","Stock Price","Multivariate Time Series","Univariate Time Series","Dynamic Bayesian Network","Northwesterly Winds","Causal Model","Causal Analysis"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3102966","title":"Towards Systematic Design Considerations for Visualizing Cross-View Data Relationships","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":128,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, IL, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073375900","id":37073375900,"full_name":"Maoyuan Sun","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, IL, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, IL, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089574756","id":37089574756,"full_name":"Akhil Namburi","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, IL, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, IL, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37647314800","id":37647314800,"full_name":"David Koop","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, IL, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38024987300","id":38024987300,"full_name":"Jian Zhao","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Information Technology, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088659418","id":37088659418,"full_name":"Tianyi Li","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Information Technology, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of Alabama in Huntsville, Huntsville, AL, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37597408500","id":37597408500,"full_name":"Haeyong Chung","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Alabama in Huntsville, Huntsville, AL, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Due to the scale of data and the complexity of analysis tasks, insight discovery often requires coordinating multiple visualizations (views), with each view displaying different parts of data or the same data from different perspectives. For example, to analyze car sales records, a marketing analyst uses a line chart to visualize the trend of car sales, a scatterplot to inspect the price and horsepower of different cars, and a matrix to compare the transaction amounts in types of deals. To explore related information across multiple views, current visual analysis tools heavily rely on brushing and linking techniques, which may require a significant amount of user effort (e.g., many trial-and-error attempts). There may be other efficient and effective ways of displaying cross-view data relationships to support data analysis with multiple views, but currently there are no guidelines to address this design challenge. In this article, we present systematic design considerations for visualizing cross-view data relationships, which leverages descriptive aspects of relationships and usable visual context of multi-view visualizations. We discuss pros and cons of different designs for showing cross-view data relationships, and provide a set of recommendations for helping practitioners make design decisions.","article_number":"9508898","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9508898","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9508898/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9508898/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9930678,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 Dec. 2022","start_page":"4741","end_page":"4756","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":606,"insert_date":"20210806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Data visualization","Visual analytics","Systematics","Periodic structures","Computer science"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Cross-view data relationship","multiple views","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Design Considerations","Systematic Consideration","Related Information","Visual Analysis","Relational Aspects","Analysis Tasks","Design Decisions","Visual Context","User Effort","Visual Analytics Tool","Relative Levels","Types Of Information","Relative Weight","Types Of Relationships","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Spatial Organization","Design Requirements","Availability Of Space","Accessible Space","Multiple Relationships","Multiplicative Relationship","Related Elements","Visual Elements","Visual Markers","Visual Encoding","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Design Options","Visual Design","Type Of Visualization","Screen Space","Color Saturation","Colour Saturation","Common Scale"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3159630","title":"CosmoVis: An Interactive Visual Analysis Tool for Exploring Hydrodynamic Cosmological Simulations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"8","issn":"2160-9306","rank":129,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of California, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087129240","id":37087129240,"full_name":"David Abramov","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655628","id":37088655628,"full_name":"Joseph N.

CosmoVis introduces a range of features to facilitate real-time analysis of these simulations, including the use of “virtual skewers,” simulated analogues of absorption line spectroscopy that act as spectral probes piercing the volume of gaseous cosmic medium. We explain how such synthetic spectra can be used to gain insight into the source datasets and to make functional comparisons with observational data. Furthermore, we identify the main analysis tasks that CosmoVis enables and present implementation details of the software interface and the client-server architecture.

Yet different people may vary in their ability to read different visualization types, leading to variance in this ranking across individuals not captured by population-level metrics using “average observer” models. One way we can bridge this gap is by recasting classic visual perception tasks as tools for assessing individual performance, in addition to overall visualization performance. In this article we replicate and extend Cleveland and McGill's graphical comparison experiment using Bayesian multilevel regression, using these models to explore individual differences in visualization skill from multiple perspectives. The results from experiments and modeling indicate that some people show patterns of accuracy that credibly deviate from the canonical rankings of visualization effectiveness. We discuss implications of these findings, such as a need for new ways to communicate visualization effectiveness to designers, how patterns in individuals’ responses may show systematic biases and strategies in visualization judgment, and how recasting classic visual perception tasks as tools for assessing individual performance may offer new ways to quantify aspects of visualization literacy.

Among these methods, phrase-based retrieval methods have been proven to capture more concrete and concise information than word-based and paragraph-based methods. However, due to the complex relationship among phrases and a lack of proper visual guidance, achieving user-driven interactive information-seeking and retrieval remains challenging. In this study, we present a visual analytic approach for users to seek information from an extensive collection of documents efficiently. The main component of our approach is a PhraseMap, where nodes and edges represent the extracted keyphrases and their relationships, respectively, from a large corpus. To build the PhraseMap, we extract keyphrases from each document and link the phrases according to word attention determined using modern language models, i.e., BERT. As can be imagined, the graph is complex due to the extensive volume of information and the massive amount of relationships. Therefore, we develop a navigation algorithm to facilitate information seeking. It includes (1) a question-answering (QA) model to identify phrases related to users’ queries and (2) updating relevant phrases based on users’ feedback. To better present the PhraseMap, we introduce a resource-controlled self-organizing map (RC-SOM) to evenly and regularly display phrases on grid cells while expecting phrases with similar semantics to stay close in the visualization. To evaluate our approach, we conducted case studies with three domain experts in diverse literature. The results and feedback demonstrate its effectiveness, usability, and intelligence.","article_number":"9964397","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9964397","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9964397/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9964397/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10416827,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"March 2024","start_page":"1787","end_page":"1802","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":628,"insert_date":"20221128","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Navigation","Bit error rate","Semantics","Computational modeling","Visual analytics","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Textual data","machine learning","visual analytics","natural language processing","user-in-the-loop"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Information Seeking","Information Search","Visual Analysis","Information Retrieval","Semantic Similarity","Semantic Relatedness","Domain Experts","Language Model","Intensity Information","Volume Of Information","Large Corpus","Large Corpora","Self-organizing Map","Kohonen","Visual Approach","Proper Guidance","Navigation Algorithm","Double Mutant","Delta Variant","Interactive System","Topic Modeling","User Feedback","Attention Map","Attention Weights","Omicron Variant","Relevance Score","Grid Layout","Latent Dirichlet Allocation","Map View","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Text Retrieval","Document Retrieval","Contextual Attention","BERT Model","Visual Design","Semantic Clustering"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3169590","title":"A Hybrid in Situ Approach for Cost Efficient Image Database Generation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"9","issn":"2160-9306","rank":132,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Daimler Truck AG, Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086553797","id":37086553797,"full_name":"Valentin Bruder","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Daimler Truck AG, Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Luminary Cloud, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085568281","id":37085568281,"full_name":"Matthew Larsen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Luminary Cloud, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268023800","id":37268023800,"full_name":"Thomas Ertl","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Oregon, Eugene, OR, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37411882800","id":37411882800,"full_name":"Hank Childs","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Oregon, Eugene, OR, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37553894500","id":37553894500,"full_name":"Steffen Frey","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The visualization of results while the simulation is running is increasingly common in extreme scale computing environments.

Our hybrid design differs from previous works in that it creates opportunities to minimize idle time from four fundamental types of inefficiency: variability, limited scalability, overhead, and rightsizing. We demonstrate our results by comparing our method against both inline and in transit methods for a variety of configurations, including two simulation codes and a scaling study that goes above 19 K cores.

The glyphs meet two conditions: (1) two visual dimensions are separable; and (2) one of the two visual dimensions uses a categorical representation (e.g., a categorical colormap). We evaluate how much these two conditions determine the bivariate glyphs’ effectiveness. The first experiment asks participants to perform three local tasks requiring reading no more than two glyphs. The second experiment scales up the search space in global tasks when participants must look at the entire scene of hundreds of vector glyphs to get an answer. Our results support that the first condition is necessary for local tasks when a few items are compared. But it is not enough for understanding a large amount of data. The second condition is necessary for perceiving global structures of examining very complex datasets.

While the focus of VA for explainable DL has been mainly on classification problems, DL is gaining popularity in high-dimensional-to-high-dimensional (H-H) problems such as image-to-image translation. In contrast to classification, H-H problems have no explicit instance groups or classes to study. Each output is continuous, high-dimensional, and changes in an unknown non-linear manner with changes in the input. These unknown relations between the input, model and output necessitate the user to analyze them in conjunction, leveraging symmetries between them. Since classification tasks do not exhibit some of these challenges, most existing VA systems and frameworks allow limited control of the components required to analyze models beyond classification. Hence, we identify the need for and present a unified conceptual framework, the Transform-and-Perform framework (T&P), to facilitate the design of VA systems for DL model analysis focusing on H-H problems. T&P provides a checklist to structure and identify workflows and analysis strategies to design new VA systems, and understand existing ones to uncover potential gaps for improvements. The goal is to aid the creation of effective VA systems that support the structuring of model understanding and identifying actionable insights for model improvements. We highlight the growing need for new frameworks like T&P with a real-world image-to-image translation application. We illustrate how T&P effectively supports the understanding and identification of potential gaps in existing VA systems.","article_number":"9937145","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9937145","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9937145/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9937145/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10379475,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Feb. 2024","start_page":"1502","end_page":"1515","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":583,"insert_date":"20221103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Analytical models","Behavioral sciences","Complexity theory","Computational modeling","Task analysis","Context modeling","Brain modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","explainable AI","framework","deep learning","high-dimensional-to-high-dimensional translation","XAI"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Deep Learning","Model Analysis","Analysis Strategy","Deep Learning Models","Actual Knowledge","Actionable Insights","Potential Gaps","Potential Disruption","Changes In Input","Model Performance","Control Variables","Related Studies","System Design","Input Features","Model Input","Generative Adversarial Networks","Adversarial Learning","Trainable Parameters","Space Model","Random Vector","Changes In Output","Changes In Yield","Equivalency","Input Space","Input-output Relationship","Inductive Bias","Pre-defined Groups","Training Context","User Tasks","Visual Components","Original Distribution","Typical Output","User Goals","Global Patterns"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3219762","title":"DocFlow: A Visual Analytics System for Question-Based Document Retrieval and Categorization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":137,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089836548","id":37089836548,"full_name":"Rui Qiu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088872710","id":37088872710,"full_name":"Yamei Tu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, HsinChu, Taiwan","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407536000","id":37407536000,"full_name":"Yu-Shuen Wang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, HsinChu, Taiwan"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute for Informatics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086825326","id":37086825326,"full_name":"Po-Yin Yen","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute for Informatics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279493500","id":37279493500,"full_name":"Han-Wei Shen","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"A systematic review (SR) is essential with up-to-date research evidence to support clinical decisions and practices. However, the growing literature volume makes it challenging for SR reviewers and clinicians to discover useful information efficiently. Many human-in-the-loop information retrieval approaches (HIR) have been proposed to rank documents semantically similar to users’ queries and provide interactive visualizations to facilitate document retrieval. Given that the queries are mainly composed of keywords and keyphrases retrieving documents that are semantically similar to a query does not necessarily respond to the clinician's need. Clinicians still have to review many documents to find the solution. The problem motivates us to develop a visual analytics system, DocFlow, to facilitate information-seeking. One of the features of our DocFlow is accepting natural language questions. The detailed description enables retrieving documents that can answer users’ questions. Additionally, clinicians often categorize documents based on their backgrounds and with different purposes (e.g., populations, treatments). Since the criteria are unknown and cannot be pre-defined in advance, existing methods can only achieve categorization by considering the entire information in documents. In contrast, by locating answers in each document, our DocFlow can intelligently categorize documents based on users’ questions. The second feature of our DocFlow is a flexible interface where users can arrange a sequence of questions to customize their rules for document retrieval and categorization. The two features of this visual analytics system support a flexible information-seeking process. The case studies and the feedback from domain experts demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of our DocFlow.","article_number":"9939115","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9939115","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9939115/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9939115/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10379475,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Feb. 2024","start_page":"1533","end_page":"1548","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":601,"insert_date":"20221104","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Systematics","Visual analytics","Task analysis","Semantics","Human in the loop","Natural languages","Bit error rate"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Biomedical systematic review","evidence-based-practice","human-in-the-loop information retrieval","question-based document categorization","question-based document retrieval"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Text Classification","Text Categorization","Document Classification","Text Retrieval","Document Retrieval","Visual Analytics System","Systematic Review","Semantic","Natural Language","Visual System","Information Retrieval","Natural Question","Domain Experts","Interactive Visualization","Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder","ADHD","Attention Deficit/hyperactivity Disorder","Interactive System","First Category","Language Model","Large Corpus","Large Corpora","Retrieval Process","Long COVID","post-COVID","Biomedical Domain","Methylphenidate","Sequence Of Words","Visual Parameters","Sankey Diagram","Sankey Plot","Retrieval Performance","Systematic Review Process","Multiple Queries","Atomoxetine","Network Alignment"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3274572","title":"A Scalable Method for Readable Tree Layouts","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":138,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089479557","id":37089479557,"full_name":"Kathryn Gray","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086545166","id":37086545166,"full_name":"Mingwei Li","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089372701","id":37089372701,"full_name":"Reyan Ahmed","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088396932","id":37088396932,"full_name":"Md.

Yet, scalable, easy to read tree layouts are difficult to achieve. We consider tree layouts to be readable if they meet some basic requirements: node labels should not overlap, edges should not cross, edge lengths should be preserved, and the output should be compact. There are many algorithms for drawing trees, although very few take node labels or edge lengths into account, and none optimizes all requirements above. With this in mind, we propose a new scalable method for readable tree layouts. The algorithm guarantees that the layout has no edge crossings and no label overlaps, and optimizes one of the remaining aspects: desired edge lengths and compactness. We evaluate the performance of the new algorithm by comparison with related earlier approaches using several real-world datasets, ranging from a few thousand nodes to hundreds of thousands of nodes. Tree layout algorithms can be used to visualize large general graphs, by extracting a hierarchy of progressively larger trees. We illustrate this functionality by presenting several map-like visualizations generated by the new tree layout algorithm.","article_number":"10122175","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10122175","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122175/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122175/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10379475,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Feb. 2024","start_page":"1564","end_page":"1578","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":343,"insert_date":"20230509","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Layout","Visualization","Vegetation","Semantics","Optimization","Topology","Stress"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Force-directed","readability","tree layouts"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Scalable","Tree Layout","Real-world Datasets","Edge Length","Large Trees","Node Labels","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Thousands Of Nodes","Aspect Ratio","Parallelization","Parallel Computing","Bounding Box","Repulsive Forces","Edge Weights","Tree Of Life","Live Trees","Important Nodes","Interactive Visualization","Optimization Goal","Prior Methods","Hard Constraints","Breadth-first Search","Breadth-first","Network Layout","Uniform Set","Circular Layout","Force Strength","Final Iteration","Final Loop","Parallel Version","Nodal Coordinates","Node Weights","Tree Size","Iterative Algorithm"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3135697","title":"Provectories: Embedding-Based Analysis of Interaction Provenance Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":139,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089664419","id":37089664419,"full_name":"Conny Walchshofer","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088767380","id":37088767380,"full_name":"Andreas Hinterreiter","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Middlesex University London, London, U.K.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273812200","id":37273812200,"full_name":"Kai Xu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Middlesex University London, London, U.K."]}},{"affiliation":"Datavisyn GmbH, Linz, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085497544","id":37085497544,"full_name":"Holger Stitz","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Datavisyn GmbH, Linz, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403918900","id":37403918900,"full_name":"Marc Streit","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria","Datavisyn GmbH, Linz, Austria"]}}]},"access_type":"CCBY - IEEE is not the copyright holder of this material.

Existing approaches rely largely on time-consuming manual processes such as interviews and the analysis of observational data. While it is technically possible to capture a history of user interactions and application states, it remains difficult to extract and describe analysis strategies based on interaction provenance. In this article, we propose a novel visual approach to the meta-analysis of interaction provenance. We capture single and multiple user sessions as graphs of high-dimensional application states. Our meta-analysis is based on two different types of two-dimensional embeddings of these high-dimensional states: layouts based on (i) topology and (ii) attribute similarity. We applied these visualization approaches to synthetic and real user provenance data captured in two user studies. From our visualizations, we were able to extract patterns for data types and analytical reasoning strategies.","article_number":"9652041","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9652041","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9652041/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9652041/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10314810,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Dec. 2023","start_page":"4816","end_page":"4831","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":969,"insert_date":"20211215","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Layout","Cognition","Visual analytics","Time series analysis","Task analysis","Collaboration"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization techniques","information visualization","visual analytics","interaction provenance","sensemaking"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Analysis Strategy","User Study","Visual Analysis","Single Session","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Multiple Users","Multiple Use","Multiple Sessions","Single User","Visual Approach","User Sessions","Child Mortality","Mortality In Children","Childhood Mortality","Under-five Mortality","End Of Session","End Of Each Session","Visualization Tool","Latent Space","Embedding Space","Unique Conditions","Unique Status","Unique State","Vector Representation","Visual Patterns","Interactive Visualization","Numerous Properties","Numerous Attributes","Numerous Dimensions","Semantic Representations","Categorical Attributes","Classification Properties","Attribute Classification","Boolean Algebra","Usage Intention","Visual Analytics Tool","Visual Encoding","High-dimensional Feature Vector","Representative Compounds","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Part Of Selection","User Selection"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3214771","title":"Rainbow Colormaps: What are They Good and Bad for?","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":140,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, IN, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38581219900","id":38581219900,"full_name":"Khairi Reda","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, IN, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Guidelines for color use in quantitative visualizations have strongly discouraged the use of rainbow colormaps, arguing instead for smooth designs that do not induce visual discontinuities or implicit color categories. However, the empirical evidence behind this argument has been mixed and, at times, even contradictory. In practice, rainbow colormaps are widely used, raising questions about the true utility or dangers of such designs. We study how color categorization impacts the interpretation of scalar fields. We first introduce an approach to detect latent categories in colormaps. We hypothesize that the appearance of color categories in scalar visualizations can be beneficial in that they enhance the perception of certain features, although at the cost of rendering other features less noticeable. In three crowdsourced experiments, we show that observers are more likely to discriminate global, distributional features when viewing colorful scales that induce categorization (e.g., rainbow or diverging schemes). Conversely, when seeing the same data through a less colorful representation, observers are more likely to report localized features defined by small variations in the data. Participants showed awareness of these different affordances, and exhibited bias for exploiting the more discriminating colormap, given a particular feature type. Our results demonstrate costs and benefits for rainbows (and similarly colorful schemes), suggesting that their complementary utility for analyzing scalar data should not be dismissed. In addition to explaining potentially valid uses of rainbow, our study provides actionable guidelines, including on when such designs can be more harmful than useful.

Whenever possible such representations are avoided in visualization since they are computationally demanding if compared with regular grids. In this work, we aim at simplifying the encoding and processing of simplicial meshes. The article proposes TopoCluster, a new localized data structure for tetrahedral meshes. TopoCluster provides efficient computation of the connectivity of the mesh elements with a low memory footprint. The key idea of TopoCluster is to subdivide the simplicial mesh into clusters. Then, the connectivity information is computed locally for each cluster and discarded when it is no longer needed. We define two instances of TopoCluster. The first instance prioritizes time efficiency and provides only a modest savings in memory, while the second instance drastically reduces memory consumption up to an order of magnitude with respect to comparable data structures. Thanks to the simple interface provided by TopoCluster, we have been able to integrate both data structures into the existing Topological Toolkit (TTK) framework. As a result, users can run any plugin of TTK using TopoCluster without changing a single line of code.","article_number":"9583888","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9583888","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9583888/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9583888/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10003072,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"1 Feb. 2023","start_page":"1506","end_page":"1517","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":565,"insert_date":"20211021","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data structures","Encoding","Memory management","Faces","Data visualization","Runtime","Tools"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","data structures","topological data analysis","simplicial meshes","tetrahedral meshes"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Structure","Triangular","Triangle","Time Efficiency","Memory Consumption","Triangular Mesh","Triangle Mesh","Memory Footprint","Tetrahedral Mesh","Running Time","Cluster Size","Chain Complexes","Cochain","Hash Function","Hash Table","Hash Value","Hash Codes","Subintervals","Open Interval","Closed Interval","Leaf Node","Memory Usage","Simplicial Complex","Pair Of Vertices","Vertex Pairs","Topological Relations","Clusters In Order","Edge List","Edgelist","Cache Size","Hierarchical Decomposition","Internal Edges","External Edge"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3131824","title":"RCMVis: A Visual Analytics System for Route Choice Modeling","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"2160-9306","rank":142,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37400984600","id":37400984600,"full_name":"DongHwa Shin","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Computing and Informatics, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085589835","id":37085589835,"full_name":"Jaemin Jo","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Computing and Informatics, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Division of Biomedical Engineering, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, Seoul, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37594632900","id":37594632900,"full_name":"Bohyoung Kim","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Division of Biomedical Engineering, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, Seoul, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Soongsil University, Seoul, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085891396","id":37085891396,"full_name":"Hyunjoo Song","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Soongsil University, Seoul, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089715147","id":37089715147,"full_name":"Shin-Hyung Cho","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37422552700","id":37422552700,"full_name":"Jinwook Seo","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"]}}]},"access_type":"CCBY - IEEE is not the copyright holder of this material.

It aims to model which characteristics of routes, such as distance and the number of traffic lights, affect travelers’ route choice behaviors and how much they affect the choice during their trips. Through close collaboration with domain experts, we designed a visual analytics framework for Route Choice Modeling. The framework supports three interactive analysis stages: exploration, modeling, and reasoning. In the exploration stage, we help analysts interactively explore trip data from multiple origin-destination (OD) pairs and choose a subset of data they want to focus on. To this end, we provide coordinated multiple OD views with different foci that allow analysts to inspect, rank, and compare OD pairs in terms of their multidimensional attributes. In the modeling stage, we integrate a $k$k-medoids clustering method and a path-size logit model into our system to enable analysts to model route choice behaviors from trips with support for feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model comparison. Finally, in the reasoning stage, we help analysts rationalize and refine the model by selectively inspecting the trips that strongly support the modeling result. For evaluation, we conducted a case study and interviews with domain experts. The domain experts discovered unexpected insights from numerous modeling results, allowing them to explore the hyperparameter space more effectively to gain better results. In addition, they gained OD- and road-level insights into which data mainly supported the modeling result, enabling further discussion of the model.","article_number":"9632413","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9632413","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9632413/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9632413/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10032251,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"1 March 2023","start_page":"1799","end_page":"1817","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1569,"insert_date":"20211201","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Analytical models","Visual analytics","Roads","Data models","Trajectory","Computational modeling","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Route choice modeling","urban planning","trajectory data","origin-destination","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Choice Of Model","Route Choice","Visual Analytics System","Interactive","Hyperparameters","Domain Experts","Traffic Light","Exploration Stage","Origin-destination Pairs","Number Of Lights","Model Estimates","Road Network","Street Network","Systematic Process","Choice Set","Visual Elements","Road Segments","Street Segments","Peak Hours","Flow Map","Independence Of Irrelevant Alternatives","Choice Consistency","Independence Axiom","Primary Roads","Map View","Bike Lanes","Bicycle Lanes","Cycle Lanes","Types Of Stations","Route Distance","Silhouette Score","High Goodness Of Fit","Subway Stations","Bubble Plots","Secondary Roads"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3166071","title":"Visual Assistance in Development and Validation of Bayesian Networks for Clinical Decision Support","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"8","issn":"2160-9306","rank":143,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Neurology, Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg (OVGU), Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089891367","id":37089891367,"full_name":"Juliane Müller-Sielaff","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Neurology, Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg (OVGU), Magdeburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Simulation and Graphics & Department of Neurology, OVGU, Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089891089","id":37089891089,"full_name":"Seyed Behnam Beladi","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Simulation and Graphics & Department of Neurology, OVGU, Magdeburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Radboud university medical center, Nijmegen, GA, The Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089891004","id":37089891004,"full_name":"Stephanie W.

To address this problem, we developed a novel interactive visual approach allowing medical researchers with less knowledge in CDSM to develop and validate BNs based on domain specific data mainly independently and thus, diminishing the need for an additional computer scientist. In this context, we abstracted and simplified the common workflow in BN development as well as adjusted the workflow to medical experts’ needs.

Existing methods in the literature and neuroscience practice are generally limited to the study of individual connectivity features in the brain (e.g., the strength of neural connection among brain regions). Pairwise comparisons between contrasting subject groups (e.g., the diseased and the healthy controls) are normally performed. The underlying neuroimaging and brain network construction process is assumed to have 100 percent fidelity. Yet, real-world user requirements on brain network visual comparison lean against these assumptions. In this work, we present MV$^{2}$2Net, a visual analytics system that tightly integrates multi-variate multi-view visualization for brain network comparison with an interactive wrangling mechanism to deal with data uncertainty. On the analysis side, the system integrates multiple extraction methods on diffusion and geometric connectivity features of brain networks, an anomaly detection algorithm for data quality assessment, single- and multi-connection feature selection methods for bio-marker detection. On the visualization side, novel designs are introduced which optimize network comparisons among contrasting subject groups and related connectivity features. Our design provides level-of-detail comparisons, from juxtaposed and explicit-coding views for subject group comparisons, to high-order composite view for correlation of network comparisons, and to fiber tract detail view for voxel-level comparisons. The proposed techniques are inspired and evaluated in expert studies, as well as through case analyses on diffusion and geometric bio-markers of certain neurology diseases. Results in these experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of MV$^{2}$2Net over state-of-the-art approaches.","article_number":"9492002","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9492002","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9492002/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9492002/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9930678,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 Dec. 2022","start_page":"4640","end_page":"4657","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":590,"insert_date":"20210720","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Feature extraction","Diseases","Neuroimaging","Three-dimensional displays","Neuroscience","Heuristic algorithms","Brain models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Brain network","visual comparison","multivariate analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Brain Networks","Network Comparison","Comparative Network","Uncertain Data","Multivariate Comparisons","Multivariable Comparisons","Neurological Disorders","Neurological Conditions","Neurological Diseases","Neurological Symptoms","Healthy Controls","Brain Tissue","Human Brain","Data Quality","Neuroscience","Neurobiological","Individual Characteristics","Individual Features","Subjects In Group","Visual Analysis","Visual Network","Network Diagram","Geometric Features","Geometric Characteristics","Detection Of Biomarkers","Visual Comparison","Connectivity Strength","Connection Strengths","Anomaly Detection","User Requirements","Fiber Tracts","Fiber Pathways","Fibre Tracts","Diffusion Tensor Imaging Data","Alzheimer’s Disease Group","Discriminative Features","Brain Connectivity","Multivariate Feature","Diffusion Tensor Imaging","Diffusion-weighted Imaging","Diffusion Weighted Imaging","Diffusion Tensor","Visual Design","Multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Group Network","Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209328","title":"Electromechanical Coupling in Electroactive Polymers – a Visual Analysis of a Third-Order Tensor Field","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":145,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Institute of Computer Science, Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087125694","id":37087125694,"full_name":"Chiara Hergl","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Mechanics, TU Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37090077678","id":37090077678,"full_name":"Carina Witt","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Mechanics, TU Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Computer Science, Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100148","id":37087100148,"full_name":"Baldwin Nsonga","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Mechanics, TU Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37090077961","id":37090077961,"full_name":"Andreas Menzel","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Mechanics, TU Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany","Division of Solid Mechanics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Computer Science, Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282574800","id":37282574800,"full_name":"Gerik Scheuermann","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"CCBY - IEEE is not the copyright holder of this material.

This process also works vice versa, such that mechanical deformation of the material induces an electric field in the EAP device. This specific behavior makes such materials highly attractive for the construction of actuators and sensors in various application areas. The electromechanical behaviour of electroactive polymers can be described by a third-order coupling tensor, which represents the sensitivity of mechanical stresses concerning the electric field, i.e., it establishes a relation between a second-order and a first-order tensor field. Due to this coupling tensor's complexity and the lack of meaningful visualization methods for third-order tensors in general, an interpretation of the tensor is rather difficult. Thus, the central engineering research question that this contribution deals with is a deeper understanding of electromechanical coupling by analyzing the third-order coupling tensor with the help of specific visualization methods. Starting with a deviatoric decomposition of the tensor, the multipoles of each deviator are visualized, which allows a first insight into this highly complex third-order tensor. In the present contribution, four examples, including electromechanical coupling, are simulated within a finite element framework and subsequently analyzed using the tensor visualization method.","article_number":"9905473","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9905473","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9905473/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9905473/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10314810,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Dec. 2023","start_page":"5357","end_page":"5371","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":527,"insert_date":"20220928","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Tensors","Couplings","Visualization","Strain","Behavioral sciences","Shape","Plastics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Tensor visualization","third-order tensor","deviatoric decomposition","electro-active polymer"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Electromechanical Coupling","Third-order Tensor","Finite Element","Visual Methods","Multipole","Multipolar World","Tensor Decomposition","Top Surface","Radial Direction","Color Map","Mirror Symmetry","Symmetry Plane","Reflection Symmetry","Mirror-symmetric","General Preference","General Orientation","Outer Radius","Outer Radii","Engineering Perspective","Technological Perspective","Electrical Load","Electric Vector","Electric Field Vector","Deformation Conditions","Deformation State","Symmetric Tensor","Order Tensor","Electric Potential Difference","Metalenses","Subwavelength Imaging","Meta-lens","Metamaterial Lens","Second-order Tensor","Coupling Level","Higher-order Tensors","High-order Tensor","Coupling Problem","Geometric Imperfections","Hole Surface","Dimensional Space","Multidimensional Space","Electrical Activity","Diffusion Tensor Imaging","Diffusion-weighted Imaging","Diffusion Tensor"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3173081","title":"Watertight Incremental Heightfield Tessellation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"9","issn":"2160-9306","rank":146,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"VRVis Forschungs-GmbH, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085537947","id":37085537947,"full_name":"Daniel Cornel","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VRVis Forschungs-GmbH, Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"VRVis Forschungs-GmbH, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089933978","id":37089933978,"full_name":"Silvana Zechmeister","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VRVis Forschungs-GmbH, Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Wien, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284271200","id":37284271200,"full_name":"Eduard Gröller","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Wien, Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"VRVis Forschungs-GmbH, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38111592300","id":38111592300,"full_name":"Jürgen Waser","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VRVis Forschungs-GmbH, Vienna, Austria"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this article, we propose a method for the interactive visualization of medium-scale dynamic heightfields without visual artifacts.

We present the real-world use case of unfiltered flood simulation data of such medium scale that need to be visualized in real time for scientific purposes. Our solution facilitates compute shaders to maintain a guaranteed watertight triangulation in GPU memory that approximates the interpolated heightfields with view-dependent, continuous levels of detail. In each frame, the triangulation is updated incrementally by iteratively refining the cached result of the previous frame to minimize the computational effort. In particular, we minimize the number of heightfield sampling operations to make adaptive and higher-order interpolations viable options. We impose no restriction on the number of subdivisions and the achievable level of detail to allow for extreme zoom ranges required in geospatial visualization. Our method provides a stable runtime performance and can be executed with a limited time budget. We present a comparison of our method to three state-of-the-art methods, in which our method is competitive to previous non-watertight methods in terms of runtime, while outperforming them in terms of accuracy.","article_number":"9770381","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9770381","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9770381/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9770381/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10198498,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"1 Sept. 2023","start_page":"3888","end_page":"3899","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":248,"insert_date":"20220506","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Surface reconstruction","Merging","Data visualization","Real-time systems","Rendering (computer graphics)","Interpolation","Graphics processing units"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization techniques and methodologies","heightfield rendering","terrain rendering","level of detail","tessellation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3158869","title":"Visualizing Higher-Order 3D Tensors by Multipole Lines","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"7","issn":"2160-9306","rank":147,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Institute of Computer Science, Image and Signal Processing Group, Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087125694","id":37087125694,"full_name":"Chiara Hergl","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Institute of Computer Science, Image and Signal Processing Group, Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Chair of Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering, Geotechnical Institute, Technische Universität Bergakademie Freiberg, Freiberg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38466618100","id":38466618100,"full_name":"Thomas Nagel","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Chair of Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering, Geotechnical Institute, Technische Universität Bergakademie Freiberg, Freiberg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Institute of Computer Science, Image and Signal Processing Group, Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282574800","id":37282574800,"full_name":"Gerik Scheuermann","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Institute of Computer Science, Image and Signal Processing Group, Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Physics, medicine, earth sciences, mechanical engineering, geo-engineering, bio-engineering and many more application areas use tensorial data. For example, tensors are used in formulating the balance equations of charge, mass, momentum, or energy as well as the constitutive relations that complement them. Some of these tensors (i.e., stiffness tensor, strain gradient, photo-elastic tensor) are of order higher than two. Currently, there are nearly no visualization techniques for such data beyond glyphs. An important reason for this is the limit of currently used tensor decomposition techniques. In this article, we propose to use the deviatoric decomposition to draw lines describing tensors of arbitrary order in three dimensions. The deviatoric decomposition splits a three-dimensional tensor of any order with any type of index symmetry into totally symmetric, traceless tensors. These tensors, called deviators, can be described by a unique set of directions (called multipoles by J. C. Maxwell) and scalars. These multipoles allow the definition of multipole lines which can be computed in a similar fashion to tensor lines and allow a line-based visualization of three-dimensional tensors of any order. We give examples for the visualization of symmetric, second-order tensor fields as well as fourth-order tensor fields. To allow an interpretation of the multipole lines, we analyze the connection between the multipoles and the eigenvectors/eigenvalues in the second-order case. For the fourth-order stiffness tensor, we prove relations between multipoles and important physical quantities such as shear moduli as well as the eigenvectors of the second-order right Cauchy-Green tensor.","article_number":"9737134","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9737134","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9737134/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9737134/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10137340,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"1 July 2023","start_page":"3405","end_page":"3418","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":339,"insert_date":"20220317","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Tensors","Visualization","Stress","Strain","Indexes","Data visualization","Anisotropic magnetoresistance"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Tensor algebra","higher-order tensor","line-based","deviatoric decomposition","anisotropy"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Higher-order Tensors","High-order Tensor","Eigenvectors","Traceless","Stiffness Tensor","Elastic Tensor","Compliance Tensor","Tensor Decomposition","Order Tensor","Symmetry Index","Symmetry Indices","Second-order Tensor","Symmetry Type","Fourth-order Tensor","Cauchy-Green Tensor","Eigenvalues","Young’s Modulus","Elastic Modulus","Tensile Modulus","Diffusion Tensor Imaging","Diffusion-weighted Imaging","Diffusion Tensor","Vector Field","Stress Tensor","Mirror Symmetry","Symmetry Plane","Reflection Symmetry","Mirror-symmetric","Principal Directions","Principal Stress","Eigendecomposition","Symmetric Tensor","Transversely Isotropic","Symmetric Part","Vector Lines","Orthogonal Planes","Indentation Tests","Largest Absolute Value","Normal Plane","Mirror Plane","Cauchy Stress Tensor","Deviatoric Stress Tensor","Stress Vector"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3192364","title":"Visual Cue Effects on a Classification Accuracy Estimation Task in Immersive Scatterplots","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":148,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085422673","id":37085422673,"full_name":"Fumeng Yang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38234180400","id":38234180400,"full_name":"James Tompkin","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546111900","id":37546111900,"full_name":"Lane Harrison","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275712600","id":37275712600,"full_name":"David H.

Across a desktop monitor and a head-mounted display (HMD), we assessed scatterplot designs which vary their use of visual cues—motion, shading, perspective (graphical projection), and dimensionality—on two sets of data. We conducted a user study with a summary task in which 32 participants estimated the classification accuracy of an artificial neural network from the scatterplots. With Bayesian multilevel modeling, we capture the intricate visual effects and find that no cue alone explains all the variance in estimation error. Visual motion cues generally reduce participants’ estimation error; besides this motion, using other cues may increase participants’ estimation error. Using an HMD, adding visual motion cues, providing a third data dimension, or showing a more complicated dataset leads to longer response times. We speculate that most visual cues may not strongly affect perception in immersive analytics unless they change people's mental model about data. In summary, by studying participants as they interpret the output from a complicated machine learning model, we advance our understanding of how to use the visual cues in immersive analytics.","article_number":"9834145","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9834145","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9834145/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9834145/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10314810,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"Dec. 2023","start_page":"4858","end_page":"4873","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":584,"insert_date":"20220720","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Task analysis","Data visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Neural networks","Monitoring","Training"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Virtual reality","cluster perception","information visualization","immersive analytics","dimension reduction","classification"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Classification Accuracy","Visual Cues","Visual Effects","Visual Events","Effects Of Cues","Estimate Classification Accuracy","Virtually","Virtual Environment","Virtual Reality","Neural Network","Machine Learning","Estimation Error","Error Of Approximation","Response Time","Bayesian Inference","Bayesian Methods","Bayesian Analysis","3D Space","3-dimensional Space","Third Dimension","Mental Models","Head-mounted Display","Visual Motion","Interaction Effect","Data Model","Range Of Factors","Hidden Layer","Immersive Environment","Depth Perception","Depth Cues","Magnitude Of Error","Visual Perspective","Linear Perspective","Perspective View","Perspective Projection","2D Datasets","True Accuracy","Increase In Response Time","Hidden Layer Output","Solid Color","Interaction Techniques"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3141605","title":"Do You Believe Your (Social Media) Data?

A common problem faced when visualizing this type of data is how to provide an overview that helps users navigate efficiently. Traditional approaches use coordinated views or 3D metaphors like the Space-time cube to tackle this problem. However, they suffer from overplotting and often lack spatial context, hindering data exploration. More recent techniques, such as MotionRugs, propose compact temporal summaries based on 1D projection. While powerful, these techniques do not support the situation for which the spatial extent of the objects and their intersections is relevant, such as the analysis of surveillance videos or tracking weather storms. In this article, we propose MoReVis, a visual overview of spatiotemporal data that considers the objects’ spatial extent and strives to show spatial interactions among these objects by displaying spatial intersections. Like previous techniques, our method involves projecting the spatial coordinates to 1D to produce compact summaries. However, our solution's core consists of performing a layout optimization step that sets the size and positions of the visual marks on the summary to resemble the actual values on the original space. We also provide multiple interactive mechanisms to make interpreting the results more straightforward for the user. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation and usage scenarios. Moreover, we evaluated the usefulness of MoReVis in a study with 9 participants.

For large-scale hexahedral meshes, state-of-the-art approaches often employ wavelet schemes for level of detail as well as for data compression. Here, wavelet transforms serve two purposes: (1) they achieve substantial compression for data reduction; and (2) the multiresolution encoding provides levels of detail for visualization. However, in coarser detail levels, important geometric features, such as geological faults, often get too smoothed out or lost, due to linear translation-invariant filtering. The same is true for attribute features, such as discontinuities in porosity or permeability. We present a novel, integrated approach addressing both purposes above, while preserving critical data features of both model geometry and its attributes. Our first major contribution is that we completely decouple the computation of levels of detail from data compression, and perform nonlinear filtering in a high-dimensional data space jointly representing the geological model geometry with its attributes. Computing detail levels in this space enables us to jointly preserve features in both geometry and attributes. While designed in a general way, our framework specifically employs joint bilateral filters, computed efficiently on a high-dimensional permutohedral grid. For data compression, after the computation of all detail levels, each level is separately encoded with a standard wavelet transform. Our second major contribution is a compact GPU data structure for the encoded mesh and attributes that enables direct real-time GPU visualization without prior decoding.","article_number":"9576578","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9576578","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9576578/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9576578/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10003072,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"1 Feb. 2023","start_page":"1491","end_page":"1505","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":551,"insert_date":"20211015","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Geology","Computational modeling","Data models","Data visualization","Encoding","Spatial resolution","Standards"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Geological models","structured hexahedral meshes","multiresolution representations","interactive visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Real-time Visualization","Data Structure","Wavelet Transform","Wavelet Coefficients","Interactive Visualization","Active Faults","Fracture Plane","Brittle Deformation","Seismic Fault","Nonlinear Filter","Bilateral Filter","Hexahedral Mesh","Decoding","Decryption","Dynamic Range","Frame Rate","GB Memory","Level Of Resolution","Magnitude Of Coefficient","3D Position","3D Location","Subband","Compact Representation","Image Compression","Sign And Magnitude","Corner Points","Approximation Coefficients","Coordinate Cell","Multi-scale Representation","Compressed Representation","Imaging Geometry","Reservoir Model","Storage Size","Encoding Processes","GPU Memory","ENCODE Data"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3170531","title":"Graphical Enhancements for Effective Exemplar Identification in Contextual Data Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"9","issn":"2160-9306","rank":153,"volume":"29","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089933970","id":37089933970,"full_name":"Xinyu Zhang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, NY, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Westlake University, Westlake Institute for Advanced Study and Research Center for the Industries of the Future, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085387617","id":37085387617,"full_name":"Shenghui Cheng","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Westlake University, Westlake Institute for Advanced Study and Research Center for the Industries of the Future, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273119700","id":37273119700,"full_name":"Klaus Mueller","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, NY, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"An exemplar is an entity that represents a desirable instance in a multi-attribute configuration space. It offers certain strengths in some of its attributes without unduly compromising the strengths in other attributes. Exemplars are frequently sought after in real life applications, such as systems engineering, investment banking, drug advisory, product marketing and many others. We study a specific method for the visualization of multi-attribute configuration spaces, the Data Context Map (DCM), for its capacity in enabling users to identify proper exemplars. The DCM produces a 2D embedding where users can view the data objects in the context of the data attributes. We ask whether certain graphical enhancements can aid users to gain a better understanding of the attribute-wise tradeoffs and so select better exemplar sets. We conducted several user studies for three different graphical designs, namely iso-contour, value-shaded topographic rendering and terrain topographic rendering, and compare these with a baseline DCM display. As a benchmark we use an exemplar set generated via Pareto optimization which has similar goals but unlike humans can operate in the native high-dimensional data space. Our study finds that the two topographic maps are statistically superior to both the iso-contour and the DCM baseline display.","article_number":"9765327","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9765327","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9765327/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9765327/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10198498,"publication_year":2023,"publication_date":"1 Sept. 2023","start_page":"3775","end_page":"3787","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":644,"insert_date":"20220428","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Task analysis","Visualization","Optimization","Layout","Location awareness","Pareto optimization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["High-dimensional data","multivariate data","contextual displays","exemplar generation","decision support","configuration space"]}}}]}
