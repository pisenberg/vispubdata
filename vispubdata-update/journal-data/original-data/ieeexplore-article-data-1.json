Data Badges are customizable physical conference badges that invite participants to make their own independent and personalized expressions of their academic profile by choosing and assembling a collection of predefined physical tokens on a flat wearable canvas. As our modular and intuitive design approach allows the construction to occur as a shared, collective activity, Data Badges take advantage of the creative, affective, and social values that underlie physicalization and its construction to engage participants in reflecting on personal data. Among other unexpected phenomena, we noticed how the freedom of assembly and interpretation encouraged a variety of appropriations, which expanded its intended representational space from fully representative to more resistive and provocative forms of data expression.","article_number":"9201309","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9201309","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9201309/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9201309/","publication_title":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","publication_number":38,"is_number":9238532,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"1 Nov.-Dec. 2020","start_page":"51","end_page":"60","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":666,"insert_date":"20200921","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Encoding","Cognition","Wires","Seminars","Image color analysis","Shape"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["data visualisation","physicalisation","physicalisation construction","data humanism"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Wearable","Physicalism","Assembly Process","Aggregation Process","Conference Papers","Scientific Meetings","Academic Conferences","Scientific Conferences","Context Of Use","Academic Interest","Academic Pursuits","Recommender Systems","Future Interest","Event Organizers","Freedom Of Assembly","Years Of Experience","Dimensional Data","Re-appropriation","Academic Areas","Field Of Perception","Instruction Sheet","Conversation Starter"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2018.2881523","title":"Flow Field Reduction Via Reconstructing Vector Data From 3-D Streamlines Using Deep Learning","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"4","issn":"1558-1756","rank":2,"volume":"39","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086862620","id":37086862620,"full_name":"Jun Han","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Notre Dame"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086054207","id":37086054207,"full_name":"Jun Tao","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Notre Dame"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086864734","id":37086864734,"full_name":"Hao Zheng","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Notre Dame"]}},{"affiliation":"Argonne National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085681553","id":37085681553,"full_name":"Hanqi Guo","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Argonne National Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274188200","id":37274188200,"full_name":"Danny Z.

Our method can work in the in situ visualization setting by tracing streamlines from each time step of the simulation and storing compressed streamlines for post hoc analysis where users can afford longer reconstruction time for higher reconstruction quality using decompressed streamlines. At the heart of our approach is a deep learning method for vector field reconstruction that takes the streamlines traced from the original vector fields as input and applies a two-stage process to reconstruct high-quality vector fields. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show qualitative and quantitative results with several data sets and compare our method against the de facto method of gradient vector flow in terms of speed and quality tradeoff.","article_number":"8739144","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8739144","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8739144/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8739144/","publication_title":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","publication_number":38,"is_number":8738990,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"1 July-Aug. 2019","start_page":"54","end_page":"67","citing_paper_count":31,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":773,"insert_date":"20190618","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image reconstruction","Deep learning","Image coding","Streaming media","Data visualization","Analytical models"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Deep Learning","Flow Field","Interpolation","Convolutional Neural Network","Sample Distribution","Data Reduction","Vector Field","Linear Techniques","Reconstruction Quality","Original Field","Flow Visualization","Neighboring Samples","Neighborhood Sampling","High-resolution Field","Number Of Streamlines","Scientific Visualization","Mean Square Error","Mean Square Deviation","Learning Rate","Super-resolution","Super Resolution","Super-resolution Imaging","Residual Block","Peak Signal-to-noise Ratio","Peak Signal To Noise Ratio","PSNR","Compression Rate","Error Bounds","Original Resolution","Supercurrent","Batch Normalization Layer","Two-stage Algorithm","Fitting Strategy","Fitting Scheme","Higher Peak Signal-to-noise Ratio","Bicubic"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2018.2881501","title":"Evaluating the Readability of Force Directed Graph Layouts: A Deep Learning Approach","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"4","issn":"1558-1756","rank":3,"volume":"39","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086732743","id":37086732743,"full_name":"Hammad Haleem","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085635207","id":37085635207,"full_name":"Yong Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085659211","id":37085659211,"full_name":"Abishek Puri","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Blackrock","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085890673","id":37085890673,"full_name":"Sahil Wadhwa","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Blackrock"]}},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Magazines","abstract":"Existing graph layout algorithms are usually not able to optimize all the aesthetic properties desired in a graph layout. To evaluate how well the desired visual features are reflected in a graph layout, many readability metrics have been proposed in the past decades. However, the calculation of these readability metrics often requires access to the node and edge coordinates and is usually computationally inefficient, especially for dense graphs. Importantly, when the node and edge coordinates are not accessible, it becomes impossible to evaluate the graph layouts quantitatively. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning-based approach to evaluate the readability of graph layouts by directly using graph images. A convolutional neural network architecture is proposed and trained on a benchmark dataset of graph images, which is composed of synthetically generated graphs and graphs created by sampling from real large networks. Multiple representative readability metrics (including edge crossing, node spread, and group overlap) are considered in the proposed approach. We quantitatively compare our approach to traditional methods and qualitatively evaluate our approach by showing usage scenarios and visualizing convolutional layers. This paper is a first step towards using deep learning based methods to quantitatively evaluate images from the visualization field.","article_number":"8739137","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8739137","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8739137/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8739137/","publication_title":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","publication_number":38,"is_number":8738990,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"1 July-Aug. 2019","start_page":"40","end_page":"53","citing_paper_count":24,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":841,"insert_date":"20190618","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Layout","Readability metrics","Deep learning","Measurement","Image edge detection","Visualization","Training data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Deep Learning","Graph Layout","Graph Drawing","Neural Network","Learning Models","Convolutional Neural Network","Deep Network","Deep Neural Network","Convolutional Layers","Deep Learning Models","Use Of Support","User Support","Deep Convolutional Neural Network","Convolutional Neural Network Architecture","Real Networks","Visibility Graph","Graph Generation","Deep Learning-based Approaches","Usage Scenarios","Calculation Of Metrics","Computation Of Metrics","Synthetic Generation","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Convolutional Neural Network Model","Global Metrics","Minimum Angle","Graph Metrics","Graph Distance","Absolute Loss","Simple Metrics","Parallel Coordinates","ReLU Function","CNN-based Approaches","Edge Length","Edge Lengths"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2018.2878902","title":"RNNbow: Visualizing Learning Via Backpropagation Gradients in RNNs","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"1558-1756","rank":4,"volume":"38","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Tufts University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086047966","id":37086047966,"full_name":"Dylan Cashman","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tufts University"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604893400","id":37604893400,"full_name":"Geneviève Patterson","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Tufts University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086545952","id":37086545952,"full_name":"Abigail Mosca","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tufts University"]}},{"affiliation":"Tufts University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086596262","id":37086596262,"full_name":"Nathan Watts","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tufts University"]}},{"affiliation":"Tufts University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086593371","id":37086593371,"full_name":"Shannon Robinson","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tufts University"]}},{"affiliation":"Tufts University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592409400","id":37592409400,"full_name":"Remco Chang","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tufts University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Magazines","abstract":"We present RNNbow, an interactive tool for visualizing the gradient flow during backpropagation in training of recurrent neural networks.

It supports a wide variety of data formats, algorithms, and rendering techniques for both polygonal and volumetric data. In particular, VTK's volume rendering module has long provided a comprehensive set of features such as plane clipping, color and opacity transfer functions, lighting, and other controls needed for visualization. However, due to VTK's legacy OpenGL backend and its reliance on a deprecated API, the system did not take advantage of the latest improvements in graphics hardware or the flexibility of a programmable pipeline. Additionally, this dependence on an antiquated pipeline posed restrictions when running on emerging computing platforms, thereby limiting its overall applicability. In response to these shortcomings, the VTK community developed a new and improved volume rendering module, which not only provides a modern graphics processing unit-based implementation, but also augments its capabilities with new features such as fast volume clipping, gradient-magnitude-based opacity modulation, render to texture, and hardware-based volume picking.","article_number":"8663650","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8663650","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8663650/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8663650/","publication_title":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","publication_number":38,"is_number":8663635,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"1 Jan.-Feb. 2019","start_page":"26","end_page":"43","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":763,"insert_date":"20190308","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Data visualization","Graphics processing units","Rendering (computer graphics)","Image color analysis","Transfer functions","Open source software"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Open-source","Open Source","Volume Rendering","Volumetric Rendering","Volume-rendering","Ray Casting","Ray Shooting","Scientific Visualization","Visualization Toolkit","Illumination","Lighting","Data Visualization","Transfer Function","Graphics Processing Unit","GPUs","Well-known Technique","Volumetric Data","3D Slicer","Scientific Data Analysis","Mobile Devices","Portable Devices","Volume Of Data","Intensity Data","First Pass","Bounding Box","Maximum Intensity Projection","Multiple Platforms","Depth Values","Single Pass","Exit Point","View Direction","Regeneration Buffer","Framebuffer","Frame Buffer","Display Memory","Visualization Library","Graphics Processing Unit Memory","Gradient Magnitude","Scalar Value","Mobile Platform"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2018.032421652","title":"Belle2VR: A Virtual-Reality Visualization of Subatomic Particle Physics in the Belle II Experiment","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"1558-1756","rank":18,"volume":"38","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086388447","id":37086388447,"full_name":"Zach Duer","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virginia Tech"]}},{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086388054","id":37086388054,"full_name":"Leo Piilonen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virginia Tech"]}},{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37328161000","id":37328161000,"full_name":"George Glasson","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virginia Tech"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Magazines","abstract":"Belle2VR is an interactive virtual-reality visualization of subatomic particle physics, designed by an interdisciplinary team as an educational tool for learning about and exploring subatomic particle collisions.

Narrative physicalizations borrow from narrative visualizations, storytelling with graphs, and engagement with mundane artifacts from data-objects. Our research uses a participatory approach to research-through-design and includes two interdependent studies. In the first, personalized data physicalizations are developed for three individuals. In the second, we conduct a parallel autobiographical exploration of what constitutes personal data when using a Fitbit. Our work expands the landscape of data physicalization by introducing narrative physicalizations. It suggests an experience-centric view on data physicalization where people engage physically with their data in playful ways, making their body an active agent during the reflective process.","article_number":"9200790","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9200790","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9200790/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9200790/","publication_title":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","publication_number":38,"is_number":9325018,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 Jan.-Feb. 2021","start_page":"74","end_page":"86","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":970,"insert_date":"20200918","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Reflection","Data visualization","DNA","Physiology","Physical design","Data models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["data physicalisation","personal data","embodiment"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive","Personal Data","Physicalism","Introspection","Process Of Reflection","Data In Way","Everyday Objects","Role Of Narratives","Walking","Personality","National Institute For Health And Care Excellence","Sensor Data","Graph Data","Glass Container","Reflective Discussions","Reflective Discourse"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2018.032421654","title":"Management of Cerebral Aneurysm Descriptors based on an Automatic Ostium Extraction","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"1558-1756","rank":20,"volume":"38","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Magdeburg","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085898826","id":37085898826,"full_name":"Monique Meuschke","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Magdeburg"]}},{"affiliation":"ETH Zürich","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085416142","id":37085416142,"full_name":"Tobias Günther","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["ETH Zürich"]}},{"affiliation":"Heart of Jesus Hospital","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085480556","id":37085480556,"full_name":"Ralph Wickenhöfer","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Heart of Jesus Hospital"]}},{"affiliation":"ETH Zürich","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275694700","id":37275694700,"full_name":"Markus Gross","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["ETH Zürich"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Magdeburg","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37424645300","id":37424645300,"full_name":"Bernhard Preim","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Magdeburg"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Koblenz-Landau","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085527253","id":37085527253,"full_name":"Kai Lawonn","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Koblenz-Landau"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Magazines","abstract":"We present a framework to manage cerebral aneurysms.

Provenance can be captured on varying levels of detail, and in turn activities can be characterized from different granularities. However, current approaches do not support inferring activities that can only be characterized across multiple levels of provenance. We propose a task abstraction framework that consists of a three stage approach, composed of 1) initializing a provenance task hierarchy, 2) parsing the provenance hierarchy by using an abstraction mapping mechanism, and 3) leveraging the task hierarchy in an analytical tool. Furthermore, we identify implications to accommodate iterative refinement, context, variability, and uncertainty during all stages of the framework. We describe a use case which exemplifies our abstraction framework, demonstrating how context can influence the provenance hierarchy to support analysis. The article concludes with an agenda, raising and discussing challenges that need to be considered for successfully implementing such a framework.","article_number":"8864010","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8864010","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8864010/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8864010/","publication_title":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","publication_number":38,"is_number":8889560,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"1 Nov.-Dec. 2019","start_page":"46","end_page":"60","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":466,"insert_date":"20191011","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Task analysis","Data visualization","Visualization","Cognition","Analytical models","History"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Provenance","Task Abstraction","Provenance Hierarchy","Visual Analytics","Framework","Conceptual Model","Sensemaking"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Abstract Framework","Interactive","Conceptual Framework","Visual Analysis","Data Logger","Iterative Refinement","Life Scenarios","Live Scenarios","High-level Tasks","Higher-level Tasks","Low Levels Of Interaction","Lower-level Interactions","Data Analysis Tasks","Stage Of The Framework","Ambiguity","Learning Algorithms","Machine Learning Algorithms","Hierarchical Structure","Hierarchical Organization","Visual System","Active Users","Top-down Approach","Top-down Model","Bottom-up Approach","Top-down And Bottom-up","High-level Goals","Higher-level Goals","Set Of Interactions","Bottom-up Processes","Action Units","Usage Intention","Elevation Gain","Train Machine Learning Models","Provenance Information","Mental Models","Part-of-speech","Part Of Speech","Word Class","Word Category"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2020.2968906","title":"PixelClipper: Supporting Public Engagement and Conversation About Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"1558-1756","rank":22,"volume":"40","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38016653500","id":38016653500,"full_name":"Jagoda Walny","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088232405","id":37088232405,"full_name":"Sarah Storteboom","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546710800","id":37546710800,"full_name":"Richard Pusch","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088227725","id":37088227725,"full_name":"Steven Munsu Hwang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary and University of Copenhagen","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077629700","id":37077629700,"full_name":"Søren Knudsen","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary and University of Copenhagen"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary and Simon Fraser University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37285000100","id":37285000100,"full_name":"Sheelagh Carpendale","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary and Simon Fraser University"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945380800","id":37945380800,"full_name":"Wesley Willett","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Magazines","abstract":"In this article, we present PixelClipper, a tool built for facilitating data engagement events.

We realized this framework with a CNN-based brushing technique and the result shows that with additional data from a particular user, the model can be refined (better performance in terms of accuracy), eventually converging to a personalized model based on a moderate amount of retraining.","article_number":"8739141","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8739141","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8739141/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8739141/","publication_title":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","publication_number":38,"is_number":8738990,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"1 July-Aug. 2019","start_page":"28","end_page":"39","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":390,"insert_date":"20190618","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data models","Visual analytics","Adaptation models","Data visualization","Analytical models","Deep learning"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive","Training Data","Deep Learning","Subset Of Data","Object Detection","Exploratory Data","Transfer Learning","Boolean Logic","Logic Functions","Logic Operations","Usual Model","Iterative Model","Simple Geometry","Single User","Wide Range Of Fields","Convolutional Neural Network","Parameter Space","Similar Data","User Study","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Convolutional Neural Network Model","User Preferences","Round Of The Study","User Goals","Point In Parameter Space","Model Retraining","Input Of Convolutional Neural Network","Dissimilarity Values","Bin Values","Value Of Each Bin"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2020.2973939","title":"CLEVis: A Semantic Driven Visual Analytics System for Community Level Events","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"1558-1756","rank":26,"volume":"41","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Kent State University, Kent, OH, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085388753","id":37085388753,"full_name":"Chao Ma","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Kent State University, Kent, OH, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Kent State University, Kent, OH, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37277701200","id":37277701200,"full_name":"Ye Zhao","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Kent State University, Kent, OH, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088807478","id":37088807478,"full_name":"Andrew Curtis","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Concordia University, Ann Arbor, MI, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085905956","id":37085905956,"full_name":"Farah Kamw","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Concordia University, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Duhok, Dohuk, Kurdistan Region, AJ, Iraq","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085901152","id":37085901152,"full_name":"Shamal AL-Dohuki","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Duhok, Dohuk, Kurdistan Region, AJ, Iraq"]}},{"affiliation":"UNC Charlotte, Charlotte, NC, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37292632600","id":37292632600,"full_name":"Jing Yang","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UNC Charlotte, Charlotte, NC, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Kent State University, Kent, OH, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085681542","id":37085681542,"full_name":"Suphanut Jamonnak","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Kent State University, Kent, OH, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Zakho, Dohuk, Kurdistan Region, AJ, Iraq","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086191576","id":37086191576,"full_name":"Ismael Ali","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Zakho, Dohuk, Kurdistan Region, AJ, Iraq"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Magazines","abstract":"Community-level event (CLE) datasets, such as police reports of crime events, contain abundant semantic information of event situations, and descriptions in a geospatial-temporal context.

We propose CLEVis, a neighborhood visual analytics system for CLE datasets, to help frontline users explore events for insights at community regions of interest, namely fine-grained geographical resolutions, such as small neighborhoods around local restaurants, churches, and schools. CLEVis fully utilizes semantic information by integrating automatic algorithms and interactive visualizations.

We introduce Move&Find, a multisensory data representation in which people pedalled on a bicycle to exert the energy required to power a search query on Google's servers. To evaluate Move&Find, we operationalized a framework suitable to evaluate the value of data representations in casual contexts and experimentally compared Move&Find to a corresponding visualization.

To address this contradiction, I argue that the practice of physicalization forces us to rethink traditional notions of data. This article proposes a conceptual framework to examine how physicalizations relate to data. This article develops a two-dimensional conceptual space for comparing different perspectives on data used in physicalization, drawing from design theory and critical data studies literature. One axis distinguishes between epistemological and ontological perspectives, focusing on the relationship between data and the mind. The second axis distinguishes how data relate to the world, differentiating between representational and relational perspectives. To clarify the aesthetic and conceptual implications of these different perspectives, the article discusses examples of data physicalization for each quadrant of the continuous space. It further uses the framework to examine the explicit and implicit assumptions about data in physicalization literature. As a theoretical article, it encourages practitioners to think about how data relate to the manifestations and the phenomena they try to capture. It invites exploration of the relationship between data and the world as a generative source of creative tension.","article_number":"9198117","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9198117","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9198117/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9198117/","publication_title":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","publication_number":38,"is_number":9238532,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"1 Nov.-Dec. 2020","start_page":"25","end_page":"37","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":781,"insert_date":"20200915","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Plastics","Data visualization","Image color analysis","Visualization","History","Shape"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Model","Data Collection Process","Representative Model","Focus Of Attention","Relational Context","Traditional Data","Relational Perspective","Concept Of Data","Digital Dataset","Digital Data Sets","Sankey Diagram","Sankey Plot","Physicalism","Ontological Perspective","Edge Of The Screen","Wide Range Of Relationships","Horizontal Axis","Text Data","Text Corpus","Data Definitions","View Data","History Of Science","Historical Examples","Physical Artefacts","Physical Artifacts","Ubiquitous Computing","Conceptual Information","Role Of Data","Media Arts","Tape Recorder","Tape-recorder","Features Of The World","World Characteristics","Embroidery","Embroidered"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2020.3025322","title":"Data Clothing and BigBarChart: Designing Physical Data Reports on Indoor Pollutants for Individuals and Communities","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"1558-1756","rank":35,"volume":"41","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088640457","id":37088640457,"full_name":"Laura J.

Data physicalization may be a useful tool for these communications, because it is thought to be accessible to a general audience and emotionally engaged. However, there are limited studies of data physicalization in the wild with diverse communities. Our application of this method in the Green Housing Study is an early example of using data physicalization in environmental health report-back. We gathered feedback through community meetings, prototype testing, and semistructured interviews, leading to the development of data t-shirts and other garments and person-sized bar charts. We found that participants were enthusiastic about data physicalizations, it connected them to their previous experience, and they had varying desires to share their data. Our findings suggest that researchers can enhance environmental communications by further developing the human experience of physicalizations and engaging diverse communities.","article_number":"9201339","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9201339","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9201339/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9201339/","publication_title":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","publication_number":38,"is_number":9325018,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 Jan.-Feb. 2021","start_page":"87","end_page":"98","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":409,"insert_date":"20200921","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Chemicals","Prototypes","Green products","Atmospheric measurements","Respiratory system","Particle measurements"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Environmental Health","Personal Data","Bar Charts","Impact Of Approaches","Community Meetings","Physicalism","Community Members","African American","African-American","Urine Samples","3D Printing","Environmental Data","Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons","Polycyclic Hydrocarbons","Qualitative Variables","Chemical Classes","Social Housing","Housing Policy","Public Housing","Exposure Data","Indoor Air","Phthalate","Environmental Chemicals","Early Prototype","Dust Samples","Environmental Health Research","Recognizable Form","Custom Design","Ethnographic Observations","Laser Cutting","Laser-cut","Design Process"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2018.2881985","title":"Towards Placental Surface Vasculature Exploration in Virtual Reality","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"1558-1756","rank":36,"volume":"40","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Brown University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085809074","id":37085809074,"full_name":"Johannes Novotny","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Brown University"]}},{"affiliation":"Brown University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085804569","id":37085804569,"full_name":"Wesley R.

We visualized the MRI data using direct volume rendering in a high-fidelity CAVE-like VR system, allowing medical professionals to identify relevant placental vessels directly from volume visualizations in the VR system, without prior vessel segmentation. Participants were able to trace most of the observable vascular structure, and consistently identified blood vessels down to diameters of 1 mm, an important requirement in diagnosing vascular diseases. Qualitative feedback from our participants suggests that our VR visualization is easy to understand and allows intuitive data exploration, but complex user interactions remained a challenge. Using these observations, we discuss implications and requirements for spatial tracing user interaction methods in VR environments. We believe that VR MRI visualizations are the next step towards effective surgery planning for prenatal diseases.","article_number":"8586936","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8586936","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8586936/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8586936/","publication_title":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","publication_number":38,"is_number":8951292,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"1 Jan.-Feb. 2020","start_page":"28","end_page":"39","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":461,"insert_date":"20181223","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Magnetic resonance imaging","Biomedical imaging","Data visualization","Rendering (computer graphics)","Virtual reality","Three-dimensional displays"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Virtually","Virtual Environment","Virtual Reality","Placental Surface","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Blood Vessels","Contrast Agent","Contrast Enhancement","Contrast Medium","Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scans","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Surgical Planning","Use Of Virtual Reality","Virtual Reality Users","Virtual Reality System","Expert Users","Vascular Anatomy","Volume Rendering","Volumetric Rendering","Volume-rendering","Twin-to-twin Transfusion Syndrome","Twin–twin Transfusion Syndrome","Twin-to-twin","Twin Transfusion Syndrome","Placental Vessels","Umbilical Cord","Inexperienced","Line Segment","Button Press","Interactive Tool","Wand Tool","Feedback Interviews","Brown University"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2020.2985368","title":"Many Views Are Not Enough: Designing for Synoptic Insights in Cultural Collections","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"1558-1756","rank":37,"volume":"40","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Danube University Krems","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38473976300","id":38473976300,"full_name":"Florian Windhager","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Danube University Krems"]}},{"affiliation":"Danube University Krems","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088390649","id":37088390649,"full_name":"Saminu Salisu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Danube University Krems"]}},{"affiliation":"Vienna University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086245311","id":37086245311,"full_name":"Roger A.

Yet, they also easily overwhelm visitors due to their perceptual richness and associated information. Similarly, digitized collections appear as complex, multifaceted phenomena, which can be challenging to grasp and navigate. Though visualizations can create various types of collection overviews for that matter, they do not easily assemble into a “big picture” or lead to an integrated understanding. We introduce coherence techniques to maximize connections between multiple views and apply them to the prototype PolyCube system of collection visualization: with map, set, and network visualizations it makes spatial, categorical, and relational collection aspects visible. For the essential temporal dimension, it offers four different views: superimposition, animation, juxtaposition, and space–time cube representations. A user study confirmed that better integrated visualizations support synoptic, cross-dimensional insights. An outlook is dedicated to the system's applicability within other arts and humanities data domains.","article_number":"9057396","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9057396","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9057396/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9057396/","publication_title":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","publication_number":38,"is_number":9082262,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"1 May-June 2020","start_page":"58","end_page":"71","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1007,"insert_date":"20200406","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Cultural differences","Data visualization","Cognitive science","Visualization","Motion pictures","Art"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Prototype","Cultural Heritage","Cultural Significance","Cultural Knowledge","Visual System","Visual Information","User Study","Visual Network","Network Diagram","Big Picture","Mental Models","Essential Properties","Essential Dimensions","Essential Attributes","Visualization Techniques","Information In Space","Cultural Objects","Cultural Goods","Digital Collection","Complex Systems","Design Strategies","Design Scheme","Dimensional Data","Mental Representations","Internal Representation","Point Cloud","Point Clouds","Color Code","Colour Code","Color-coding","Degree Centrality","Digital Humanities","Digital Humanitarianism","Seamless Transition","Mental Maps","Visual Design","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Uncertain Data","Collective Representation","Network View","Historical Collections"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2017.3621222","title":"Impact of Spatial Scales on the Intercomparison of Climate Scenarios","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"5","issn":"1558-1756","rank":38,"volume":"37","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of California, Santa Barbara","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086132385","id":37086132385,"full_name":"Wei Luo","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Santa Barbara"]}},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085720353","id":37085720353,"full_name":"Michael Steptoe","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Amazon Corporate","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086131133","id":37086131133,"full_name":"Zheng Chang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Amazon Corporate"]}},{"affiliation":"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086132147","id":37086132147,"full_name":"Robert Link","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086131247","id":37086131247,"full_name":"Leon Clarke","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396008400","id":37396008400,"full_name":"Ross Maciejewski","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Magazines","abstract":"Scenario analysis has been widely applied in climate science to understand the impact of climate change on the future human environment, but intercomparison and similarity analysis of different climate scenarios based on multiple simulation runs remain challenging.

We describe the use of ParaView, a well-established visualization application, to produce images and animations of results from a large set of modeling experiments, and their use in the promulgation of climate research results. Visualization can also make useful contributions to development, particularly for complex large-scale applications such as climate models. We present early results from the construction of a next-generation climate model which has been designed for use on exascale compute platforms, and show how visualization has helped in the development process, particularly with regard to higher model resolutions and novel data representations.","article_number":"9281098","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9281098","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9281098/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9281098/","publication_title":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","publication_number":38,"is_number":9325018,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 Jan.-Feb. 2021","start_page":"17","end_page":"25","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":550,"insert_date":"20201204","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Meteorology","Computational modeling","Data models","Atmospheric modeling","Data visualization","Geoscience","Climate change"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Climate Models","Climate Simulations","3D Visualization","Development Of Climate Models","High-resolution","Climate Change","Large Datasets","Large Data Sets","Scientific Community","Land Use","Land-use","Greenhouse Gas","CO2 Emissions","Greenhouse Gas Emissions","Carbon Emissions","Effects Of Climate Change","Impacts Of Climate Change","Climatological","Climate Research","Climate Science","Land Use Change","Land-use Change","Future Climate","Understanding Of Changes","Climate Response","Understanding Of Climate Change","Type Of Visualization","Earth's Climate","Earth Climate","Isothermal","Contour Plots","Finite Element Method","Finite Element Methods","Finite-element Method","Near-surface Temperature","Shared Socioeconomic Pathways","Native Format","Met Office","Meteorological Office","Earth System Models","Near-surface Air Temperature","Atmospheric Concentration","Spherical Surface","Regular Grid","Cartesian Grid","Grid Structure","Rectangular Grid"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2017.3621224","title":"Name Profiler Toolkit","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"5","issn":"1558-1756","rank":41,"volume":"37","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Arizona State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403438500","id":37403438500,"full_name":"Feng Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086099873","id":37086099873,"full_name":"Brett Hansen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086100856","id":37086100856,"full_name":"Ryan Simmons","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396008400","id":37396008400,"full_name":"Ross Maciejewski","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Magazines","abstract":"The Name Profiler Toolkit is a visual analytics system designed to enable the interactive exploration and analysis of forename and surname geographical distributions across the United States.

Multidimensional projections (MDP) figure among the most important visualization techniques in this context, transforming multidimensional data into scatter plots whose visual patterns reflect some notion of similarity in the original data. However, MDP come with distortions that make these visual patterns not trustworthy, hindering users to infer actual data characteristics. Moreover, the patterns present in the scatter plots might not be enough to allow a clear understanding of multidimensional data, motivating the development of layout enrichment methodologies to operate together with MDP. This survey attempts to cover the main aspects of MDP as a visualization and visual analytic tool. It provides detailed analysis and taxonomies as to the organization of MDP techniques according to their main properties and traits, discussing the impact of such properties for visual perception and other human factors. The survey also approaches the different types of distortions that can result from MDP mappings and it overviews existing mechanisms to quantitatively evaluate such distortions. A qualitative analysis of the impact of distortions on the different analytic tasks performed by users when exploring multidimensional data through MDP is also presented. Guidelines for choosing the best MDP for an intended task are also provided as a result of this analysis. Finally, layout enrichment schemes to debunk MDP distortions and/or reveal relevant information not directly inferable from the scatter plot are reviewed and discussed in the light of new taxonomies. We conclude the survey providing future research axes to fill discovered gaps in this domain.","article_number":"8383983","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8383983","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8383983/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8383983/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8750990,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"1 Aug. 2019","start_page":"2650","end_page":"2673","citing_paper_count":119,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":3187,"insert_date":"20180613","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Layout","Distortion","Task analysis","Taxonomy","Data visualization","Visual perception"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Multidimensional projection","dimensionality reduction","multidimensional scaling","error analysis","layout enrichment"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Multidimensional Projection","Scatter Plot","Similar Data","Visual Perception","Multidimensional Data","Multidimensional Analysis","Analysis Tasks","Distortion Types","Linear Method","Linear Methods","Control Points","Local Method","Local Methods","Data Space","Labeled Data","Original Space","Outlier Data","Enrichment Method","Enrichment Methods","Localization Techniques","Description Task","Visual Space","Cartesian Space","Cartesian Plane","Cartesian Axes","Similar Laws","Cluster Matching","Classical Multidimensional Scaling","Instance Pairs","Local Distortion","Group Of Instances","Neighborhood Structure","Neighbourhood Structure","Neighboring Structures","Graph Layout","Graph Drawing","Mental Maps","Neighborhood Information","Neighbor Information","Neighbourhood Information"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2829750","title":"Task-Based Effectiveness of Basic Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"7","issn":"2160-9306","rank":46,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085593133","id":37085593133,"full_name":"Bahador Saket","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681759500","id":37681759500,"full_name":"Alex Endert","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA"]}},{"affiliation":"IBM Research, Yorktown Heights, NY","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085459182","id":37085459182,"full_name":"Çağatay Demiralp","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IBM Research, Yorktown Heights, NY"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Visualizations of tabular data are widely used; understanding their effectiveness in different task and data contexts is fundamental to scaling their impact.

We find the effectiveness of these visualization types significantly varies across task, suggesting that visualization design would benefit from considering context-dependent effectiveness.

Existing taxonomies are organized by cognitive theories that are hard to associate with visualization tasks.

The resulting grammar is called Atom, and is based on passing data through a series of layout operations that divide the output of previous operations recursively until the size and position of every data point can be determined.

Much of their popularity rests on their playful visual appeal. In this paper, we present the results of a series of controlled experiments that show that layouts in which words are arranged into semantically and visually distinct zones are more effective for understanding the underlying topics than standard word cloud layouts. White space separators and/or spatially grouped color coding led to significantly stronger understanding of the underlying topics compared to a standard Wordle layout, while simultaneously scoring higher on measures of aesthetic appeal. This work is an advance on prior research on semantic layouts for word clouds because that prior work has either not ensured that the different semantic groupings are visually or semantically distinct, or has not performed usability studies. An additional contribution of this work is the development of a dataset for a semantic category identification task that can be used for replication of these results or future evaluations of word cloud designs.","article_number":"8665933","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8665933","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8665933/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8665933/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9152193,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"1 Sept. 2020","start_page":"2748","end_page":"2761","citing_paper_count":47,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1849,"insert_date":"20190312","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Tag clouds","Layout","Task analysis","Semantics","White spaces","Tools","Color"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Information visualization","word clouds","text analysis","data analytics","evaluation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Cloud Data","Word Cloud","Word Clouds","User Study","Analysis Tasks","Color Code","Colour Code","Color-coding","White Space","Aesthetic Appeal","Esthetic Appeal","Semantic Groups","Linear Mixed Model","Task Performance","Cohen’s D","Points In Space","Eye-tracking","Binomial Model","Bounding Box","Part-of-speech","Part Of Speech","Word Class","Word Category","Colorblind","Color Blindness","Colour-blind","Color Vision Deficiency","Differences In Mean Scores","Participant Preference","Participants Preferred","Font Size","Subjective Questions","Question Topics","Column Formation","Fluent English Speakers","Spatial Layout","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Fluent Speakers","Groups Of Words","Crowdsourcing","Typical Layout","Word Embedding","Word Vectors"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2889054","title":"Supporting Story Synthesis: Bridging the Gap between Visual Analytics and Storytelling","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"7","issn":"2160-9306","rank":50,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer Institute IAIS, Sankt Augustin, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085387892","id":37085387892,"full_name":"Siming Chen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute IAIS, Sankt Augustin, Germany","University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085431300","id":37085431300,"full_name":"Jie Li","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer Institute IAIS, Sankt Augustin, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047100","id":37283047100,"full_name":"Gennady Andrienko","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute IAIS, Sankt Augustin, Germany","City, University of London, London, United Kingdom"]}},{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer Institute IAIS, Sankt Augustin, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047700","id":37283047700,"full_name":"Natalia Andrienko","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute IAIS, Sankt Augustin, Germany","City, University of London, London, United Kingdom"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086545328","id":37086545328,"full_name":"Yun Wang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"City, University of London, London, United Kingdom","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490354300","id":38490354300,"full_name":"Phong H.

Findings and results of the analysis often need to be communicated to an audience that lacks visual analytics expertise. This requires analysis outcomes to be presented in simpler ways than that are typically used in visual analytics systems. However, not only analytical visualizations may be too complex for target audiences but also the information that needs to be presented. Analysis results may consist of multiple components, which may involve multiple heterogeneous facets. Hence, there exists a gap on the path from obtaining analysis findings to communicating them, within which two main challenges lie: information complexity and display complexity. We address this problem by proposing a general framework where data analysis and result presentation are linked by story synthesis, in which the analyst creates and organises story contents. Unlike previous research, where analytic findings are represented by stored display states, we treat findings as data constructs. We focus on selecting, assembling and organizing findings for further presentation rather than on tracking analysis history and enabling dual (i.e., explorative and communicative) use of data displays. In story synthesis, findings are selected, assembled, and arranged in meaningful layouts that take into account the structure of information and inherent properties of its components. We propose a workflow for applying the proposed conceptual framework in designing visual analytics systems and demonstrate the generality of the approach by applying it to two diverse domains, social media and movement analysis.","article_number":"8585048","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8585048","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585048/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585048/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9103189,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"1 July 2020","start_page":"2499","end_page":"2516","citing_paper_count":45,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2464,"insert_date":"20181221","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Rivers","Bridges","Social network services","Tools","Hospitals"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Story synthesis","visual analytics","social media","spatio-temporal data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Visual Storytelling","Social Media","Social Platforms","Audience","Conceptual Framework","Visual System","General Framework","Multiple Aspects","Multiple Facets","Variety Of Domains","Diverse Domains","Visualization Techniques","Story Content","Airport","Pieces Of Information","Temporal Relationship","Temporal Distribution","Semantic Similarity","Semantic Relatedness","Wind Direction","Visual Display","Topic Modeling","Key Nodes","Story Structure","Inherent Relationship","Social Media Data","Social Media Analytics","Twitter Posts","Tweeting","Temporal Similarity","Temporal Aggregation","Text Annotation","Main Keywords","Organization Of Information","Suitable Representation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2764459","title":"StreamExplorer: A Multi-Stage System for Visually Exploring Events in Social Streams","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"10","issn":"2160-9306","rank":51,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","id":37407308300,"full_name":"Yingcai Wu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37090037186","id":37090037186,"full_name":"Chen Zhu-Tian","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085399384","id":37085399384,"full_name":"Guodao Sun","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086448603","id":37086448603,"full_name":"Xiao Xie","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Design and Innovation, Tongji University, Shanghai, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604309600","id":37604309600,"full_name":"Nan Cao","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Design and Innovation, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Software, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406039100","id":37406039100,"full_name":"Shixia Liu","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Software, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37391623900","id":37391623900,"full_name":"Weiwei Cui","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research, Beijing, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Analyzing social streams is important for many applications, such as crisis management. However, the considerable diversity, increasing volume, and high dynamics of social streams of large events continue to be significant challenges that must be overcome to ensure effective exploration. We propose a novel framework by which to handle complex social streams on a budget PC. This framework features two components: 1) an online method to detect important time periods (i.e., subevents), and 2) a tailored GPU-assisted Self-Organizing Map (SOM) method, which clusters the tweets of subevents stably and efficiently. Based on the framework, we present StreamExplorer to facilitate the visual analysis, tracking, and comparison of a social stream at three levels. At a macroscopic level, StreamExplorer uses a new glyph-based timeline visualization, which presents a quick multi-faceted overview of the ebb and flow of a social stream. At a mesoscopic level, a map visualization is employed to visually summarize the social stream from either a topical or geographical aspect. At a microscopic level, users can employ interactive lenses to visually examine and explore the social stream from different perspectives. Two case studies and a task-based evaluation are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of StreamExplorer.","article_number":"8074775","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8074775","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8074775/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8074775/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8452941,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"1 Oct. 2018","start_page":"2758","end_page":"2772","citing_paper_count":39,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1535,"insert_date":"20171019","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Lenses","Monitoring","Electronic mail","Social network services"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Social media visualization","visual analytics","social stream","streaming data","self-organizing map"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Multivariable Systems","Topical","Visual Comparison","Visual Map","Macroscopic Level","Self-organizing Map","Kohonen","Dynamic Changes","Precision And Recall","Cartographic","Data Streams","Semantic Similarity","Semantic Relatedness","Series Of Functions","Series Of Maps","Live Streaming","Latent Dirichlet Allocation","Visual Design","Line Chart","Topic Clusters","Subjects In Cluster","Influential Users","Merging Clusters","Map For Each Subject","Topic Maps","Maps Of Subjects","Visual Metaphors","Types Of Lenses","Lens Type","Volume Of Tweets","Co-authors Of This Paper","Stream Analysis","Monitoring Task","Concentric Rings","Social Media","Social Platforms","Twitter Data"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3057483","title":"Net2Vis – A Visual Grammar for Automatically Generating Publication-Tailored CNN Architecture Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":52,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Visual Computing Group at Ulm University, Ulm, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088861832","id":37088861832,"full_name":"Alex Bäuerle","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Computing Group at Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Visual Computing Group at Ulm University, Ulm, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088861834","id":37088861834,"full_name":"Christian van Onzenoodt","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Computing Group at Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Visual Computing Group at Ulm University, Ulm, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295281400","id":37295281400,"full_name":"Timo Ropinski","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Computing Group at Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"To convey neural network architectures in publications, appropriate visualizations are of great importance. While most current deep learning papers contain such visualizations, these are usually handcrafted just before publication, which results in a lack of a common visual grammar, significant time investment, errors, and ambiguities. Current automatic network visualization tools focus on debugging the network itself and are not ideal for generating publication visualizations. Therefore, we present an approach to automate this process by translating network architectures specified in Keras into visualizations that can directly be embedded into any publication. To do so, we propose a visual grammar for convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which has been derived from an analysis of such figures extracted from all ICCV and CVPR papers published between 2013 and 2019. The proposed grammar incorporates visual encoding, network layout, layer aggregation, and legend generation. We have further realized our approach in an online system available to the community, which we have evaluated through expert feedback, and a quantitative study. It not only reduces the time needed to generate network visualizations for publications, but also enables a unified and unambiguous visualization design.","article_number":"9350177","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9350177","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9350177/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9350177/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9429958,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 June 2021","start_page":"2980","end_page":"2991","citing_paper_count":37,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":921,"insert_date":"20210208","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Network architecture","Computer architecture","Grammar","Layout","Encoding"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Neural networks","architecture visualization","graph layouting"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Convolutional Neural Network","Convolutional Neural Network Architecture","Visual Grammar","Quantitative Data","Quantitative Method","Quantitative Assessment","Quantitative Research","Quantitative Studies","Quantitative Approach","Quantitative Methods","Neural Network","Visual Network","Network Diagram","Neural Architecture","Unique Design","Unique Names","Visual Design","Expert Feedback","Aggregation Layer","Network Layout","Visual Encoding","Spatial Resolution","Spatial Dimensions","Spatial Attributes","Percentage Of Cases","Design Space","Feature Channels","Channel Characteristics","Public Use","Textual Descriptions","Modern Architecture","Modern Design","Properties Of Layer","Computational Graph","Visualization Techniques","Visual Approach","Output Samples","Yield Of Samples","HSV Color","HSV Color Space","Hue, Saturation, Value","Hue-saturation-value","Network Graph","Overview Of Architecture","Visibility Graph"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2963659","title":"EmotionCues: Emotion-Oriented Visual Summarization of Classroom Videos","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"7","issn":"2160-9306","rank":53,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085732774","id":37085732774,"full_name":"Haipeng Zeng","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086245904","id":37086245904,"full_name":"Xinhuan Shu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088875910","id":37088875910,"full_name":"Yanbang Wang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085635207","id":37085635207,"full_name":"Yong Wang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085666311","id":37085666311,"full_name":"Liguo Zhang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086924787","id":37086924787,"full_name":"Ting-Chuen Pong","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Analyzing students’ emotions from classroom videos can help both teachers and parents quickly know the engagement of students in class.

In this article, we propose EmotionCues, a visual analytics system to easily analyze classroom videos from the perspective of emotion summary and detailed analysis, which integrates emotion recognition algorithms with visualizations. It consists of three coordinated views: a summary view depicting the overall emotions and their dynamic evolution, a character view presenting the detailed emotion status of an individual, and a video view enhancing the video analysis with further details. Considering the possible inaccuracy of emotion recognition, we also explore several factors affecting the emotion analysis, such as face size and occlusion. They provide hints for inferring the possible inaccuracy and the corresponding reasons.

PAOH represents vertices as parallel horizontal bars and hyperedges as vertical lines, using dots to depict the connections to one or more vertices. We describe a prototype implementation of Parallel Aggregated Ordered Hypergraph, report on a usability study with 9 participants analyzing publication data, and summarize the improvements made.

It is easy to learn and well suited for medium size dynamic hypergraphs (50-500 vertices) such as those commonly generated by digital humanities projects-our driving application domain.","article_number":"8789484","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8789484","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8789484/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8789484/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9269519,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 Jan. 2021","start_page":"1","end_page":"13","citing_paper_count":34,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1657,"insert_date":"20190806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Contracts","Motion pictures","Usability","Topology","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["dynamic graph","interaction","case study","dynamic hypergraph","digital humanities","usability "]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Hypergraph","Vertical Line","Time Slot","Business Partners","Digital Humanities","Digital Humanitarianism","Co-authorship Network","Historians","Historiography","Dynamic Network","Readability","Visual Network","Network Diagram","18th Century","Visual Properties","Visual Attributes","Visibility Graph","Trade Network","Graph Topology","Use Of Color","Use Of Colour","Color Manipulation","Bipartite Network","Horizontal Spacing","Horizontal Forms","Dynamic Graph","Slot Width","Slot Widths","Regular Graphs","Scrolling","Ordering Of The Vertices","Vertex Order","Visual Encoding","Vertex Labels","Graph Labels","Closed Curve","Senior Researchers","Principal Researcher","Junior Researchers"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2940580","title":"Visual Cause Analytics for Traffic Congestion","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"2160-9306","rank":55,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656360","id":37088656360,"full_name":"Mingyu Pi","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088377428","id":37088377428,"full_name":"Hanbyul Yeon","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088378097","id":37088378097,"full_name":"Hyesook Son","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37557344300","id":37557344300,"full_name":"Yun Jang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Urban traffic congestion has become an important issue not only affecting our daily lives, but also limiting economic development. The primary cause of urban traffic congestion is that the number of vehicles is higher than the permissible limit of the road. Previous studies have focused on dispersing traffic volume by detecting urban traffic congestion zones and predicting future trends. However, to solve the fundamental problem, it is necessary to discover the cause of traffic congestion. Nevertheless, it is difficult to find a research which presents an approach to identify the causes of traffic congestion. In this paper, we propose a technique to analyze the cause of traffic congestion based on the traffic flow theory. We extract vehicle flows from traffic data, such as GPS trajectory and Vehicle Detector data. We detect vehicle flow changes utilizing the entropy from the information theory. Then, we build cumulative vehicle count curves (N-curve) that can quantify the flow of the vehicles in the traffic congestion area. The N-curves are classified into four different traffic congestion patterns by a convolutional neural network. Analyzing the causes and influence of traffic congestion is difficult and requires considerable experience and knowledge. Therefore, we present a visual analytics system that can efficiently perform a series of processes to analyze the cause and influence of traffic congestion. Through case studies, we have evaluated that our system can classify the causes of traffic congestion and can be used efficiently in road planning.","article_number":"8827957","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8827957","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8827957/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8827957/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340102,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 March 2021","start_page":"2186","end_page":"2201","citing_paper_count":32,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2771,"insert_date":"20190910","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Roads","Visual analytics","Trajectory","Global Positioning System","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Causes of traffic congestion","traffic flow theory","information entropy","convolutional neural network","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Traffic Congestion","Traffic Density","Traffic Jams","Neural Network","Convolutional Neural Network","Visual System","Visual Analysis","Information Theory","Information-theoretic","Information Theoretic","Changes In Flow","Traffic Flow","Vehicular Traffic","Traffic Speed","Traffic Volume","Traffic Intensity","Traffic Data","Trajectory Data","Traffic Patterns","Vehicle Detection","Congested Areas","Vehicle Flow","GPS Trajectories","Traffic Accidents","Motor Vehicle Accidents","Car Accident","Travel Time","Average Speed","Light Signal","Traffic Signal","Direction Of The Vehicle","Traffic Situation","Traffic Information","Average Travel Time","Bad Weather","Entropy Values","Volume Of Vehicle","Adjacent Areas","Domain Experts","GPS Data"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2835485","title":"A Semantic-Based Method for Visualizing Large Image Collections","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"7","issn":"2160-9306","rank":56,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Alibaba-Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086448603","id":37086448603,"full_name":"Xiao Xie","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Alibaba-Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086840350","id":37086840350,"full_name":"Xiwen Cai","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086565230","id":37086565230,"full_name":"Junpei Zhou","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Design and Innovation, Tongji University, Shanghai, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604309600","id":37604309600,"full_name":"Nan Cao","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Design and Innovation, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Alibaba-Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","id":37407308300,"full_name":"Yingcai Wu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Alibaba-Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Interactive visualization of large image collections is important and useful in many applications, such as personal album management and user profiling on images. However, most prior studies focus on using low-level visual features of images, such as texture and color histogram, to create visualizations without considering the more important semantic information embedded in images. This paper proposes a novel visual analytic system to analyze images in a semantic-aware manner. The system mainly comprises two components: a semantic information extractor and a visual layout generator. The semantic information extractor employs an image captioning technique based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to produce descriptive captions for images, which can be transformed into semantic keywords. The layout generator employs a novel co-embedding model to project images and the associated semantic keywords to the same 2D space. Inspired by the galaxy metaphor, we further turn the projected 2D space to a galaxy visualization of images, in which semantic keywords and images are visually encoded as stars and planets. Our system naturally supports multi-scale visualization and navigation, in which users can immediately see a semantic overview of an image collection and drill down for detailed inspection of a certain group of images. Users can iteratively refine the visual layout by integrating their domain knowledge into the co-embedding process. Two task-based evaluations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system.","article_number":"8358974","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8358974","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8358974/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8358974/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8723245,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"1 July 2019","start_page":"2362","end_page":"2377","citing_paper_count":31,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1449,"insert_date":"20180515","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Semantics","Visualization","Data visualization","Task analysis","Image analysis","Data mining","Layout"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Image visualization","semantic layout","CNN","image captioning"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Image Collection","Large Collection Of Images","Convolutional Neural Network","Metaphor","Visual Features","Visual Characteristics","Semantic Information","Interactive Visualization","2D Space","Image Captioning","Image Analysis","Image Dataset","Object Detection","Number Of Images","Object Classification","Root Node","Parent Node","Semantic Similarity","Semantic Relatedness","Similar Images","Word Embedding","Word Vectors","Image Retrieval","Image Search","Semantic Content","Visual Similarity","Intuitive Visualization","Descriptive Sentences","Visual Design","Skip-gram Model","Semantic Space","User Feedback","Image Embedding","Co-occurrence Relationships","MS COCO Dataset"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2920639","title":"Inviwo — A Visualization System with Usage Abstraction Levels","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"11","issn":"2160-9306","rank":57,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Linköing University, Linköing, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38228659100","id":38228659100,"full_name":"Daniel Jönsson","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Linköing University, Linköing, Sweden"]}},{"affiliation":"Linköing University, Linköing, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085760977","id":37085760977,"full_name":"Peter Steneteg","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Linköing University, Linköing, Sweden"]}},{"affiliation":"Linköing University, Linköing, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37063678500","id":37063678500,"full_name":"Erik Sundén","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Linköing University, Linköing, Sweden"]}},{"affiliation":"Linköing University, Linköing, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085759366","id":37085759366,"full_name":"Rickard Englund","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Linköing University, Linköing, Sweden"]}},{"affiliation":"Linköing University, Linköing, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085409683","id":37085409683,"full_name":"Sathish Kottravel","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Linköing University, Linköing, Sweden"]}},{"affiliation":"Linköing University, Linköing, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37565763500","id":37565763500,"full_name":"Martin Falk","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Linköing University, Linköing, Sweden"]}},{"affiliation":"Linköing University, Linköing, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284192000","id":37284192000,"full_name":"Anders Ynnerman","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Linköing University, Linköing, Sweden"]}},{"affiliation":"Linköing University, Linköing, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282721800","id":37282721800,"full_name":"Ingrid Hotz","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Linköing University, Linköing, Sweden"]}},{"affiliation":"Ulm University, Ulm, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295281400","id":37295281400,"full_name":"Timo Ropinski","author_order":9,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Ulm University, Ulm, Germany","Linköping University, Linköing, Sweden"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The complexity of today's visualization applications demands specific visualization systems tailored for the development of these applications. Frequently, such systems utilize levels of abstraction to improve the application development process, for instance by providing a data flow network editor. Unfortunately, these abstractions result in several issues, which need to be circumvented through an abstraction-centered system design. Often, a high level of abstraction hides low level details, which makes it difficult to directly access the underlying computing platform, which would be important to achieve an optimal performance. Therefore, we propose a layer structure developed for modern and sustainable visualization systems allowing developers to interact with all contained abstraction levels. We refer to this interaction capabilities as usage abstraction levels, since we target application developers with various levels of experience. We formulate the requirements for such a system, derive the desired architecture, and present how the concepts have been exemplary realized within the Inviwo visualization system. Furthermore, we address several specific challenges that arise during the realization of such a layered architecture, such as communication between different computing platforms, performance centered encapsulation, as well as layer-independent development by supporting cross layer documentation and debugging capabilities.","article_number":"8730513","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8730513","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8730513/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8730513/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9210268,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"1 Nov. 2020","start_page":"3241","end_page":"3254","citing_paper_count":30,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1160,"insert_date":"20190604","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Pipelines","Debugging","Interoperability","Documentation","Games"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization systems","data visualization","visual analytics","data analysis","computer graphics","image processing"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual System","Level Of Abstraction","Flow Data","Development Of Applications","Vision Applications","Higher Level Of Abstraction","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Visual Representation","Python Script","Graphics Processing Unit","GPUs","Functional Unit","Graphical User Interface","Graphical Interface","Objective Data","Image Stacks","Reference Image","Regression Test","Vision Algorithms","Code Changes","Usage Examples","Example Of The Utility","Abstraction Layer","Unit Tests","Game Engine","Coding Unit","External Libraries","High Editing","Hardware Accelerators","Hardware-accelerated","Volume Of Data","Intensity Data","Scene Graph","Scripting Language"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2956697","title":"Volumetric Isosurface Rendering with Deep Learning-Based Super-Resolution","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":58,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Technical University of Munich, München, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086928571","id":37086928571,"full_name":"Sebastian Weiss","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technical University of Munich, München, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Technical University of Munich, München, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088860151","id":37088860151,"full_name":"Mengyu Chu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technical University of Munich, München, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Technical University of Munich, München, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088391836","id":37088391836,"full_name":"Nils Thuerey","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technical University of Munich, München, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Technical University of Munich, München, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37444424000","id":37444424000,"full_name":"Rüdiger Westermann","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technical University of Munich, München, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Rendering an accurate image of an isosurface in a volumetric field typically requires large numbers of data samples. Reducing this number lies at the core of research in volume rendering. With the advent of deep learning networks, a number of architectures have been proposed recently to infer missing samples in multidimensional fields, for applications such as image super-resolution. In this article, we investigate the use of such architectures for learning the upscaling of a low resolution sampling of an isosurface to a higher resolution, with reconstruction of spatial detail and shading. We introduce a fully convolutional neural network, to learn a latent representation generating smooth, edge-aware depth and normal fields as well as ambient occlusions from a low resolution depth and normal field. By adding a frame-to-frame motion loss into the learning stage, upscaling can consider temporal variations and achieves improved frame-to-frame coherence. We assess the quality of inferred results and compare it to bi-linear and cubic upscaling. We do this for isosurfaces which were never seen during training, and investigate the improvements when the network can train on the same or similar isosurfaces. We discuss remote visualization and foveated rendering as potential applications.","article_number":"8918030","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8918030","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8918030/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8918030/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9429958,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 June 2021","start_page":"3064","end_page":"3078","citing_paper_count":29,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1091,"insert_date":"20191129","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Isosurfaces","Image reconstruction","Spatial resolution","Signal resolution","Rendering (computer graphics)","Training"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Machine learning","extraction of surfaces (isosurfaces, material boundaries)","volume rendering"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Deep Learning-based Super-resolution","Deep Learning-based Super Resolution","Isosurface Renderings","High-resolution","Neural Network","Deep Learning","Low Resolution","Convolutional Neural Network","Deep Network","Latent Representation","Inference Results","Loss Function","Loss-of-function","Training Data","Artificial Neural Network","Neural Network Model","Low Input","Generative Adversarial Networks","Adversarial Learning","Depth Map","Function Of Depth","Peak Signal-to-noise Ratio","Peak Signal To Noise Ratio","PSNR","Training Step","Reconstruction Quality","Multiple Frames","Low-resolution Input","Normal Map","Temporal Loss","Temporal Coherence","Super-resolution Network","Ground Truth Image","Surface Points","Perceptual Loss","Network Quality","Inference Step"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2892415","title":"MARVisT: Authoring Glyph-Based Visualization in Mobile Augmented Reality","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"8","issn":"2160-9306","rank":59,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37090037186","id":37090037186,"full_name":"Chen Zhu-Tian","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/498709531948773","id":498709531948773,"full_name":"Yijia Su","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102546","id":37087102546,"full_name":"Yifang Wang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543277","id":37086543277,"full_name":"Qianwen Wang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, P.R.

Perceptual laws such as Weber's law, for example, have been used to model the perception of correlation in scatterplots. While this thread of research has progressively refined the modeling of the perception of correlation in scatterplots, it remains unclear as to why such perception can be modeled using relatively simple functions, e.g., linear and log-linear. In this paper, we investigate a longstanding hypothesis that people use visual features in a chart as a proxy for statistical measures like correlation. For a given scatterplot, we extract 49 candidate visual features and evaluate which best align with existing models and participant judgments. The results support the hypothesis that people attend to a small number of visual features when discriminating correlation in scatterplots. We discuss how this result may account for prior conflicting findings, and how visual features provide a baseline for future model-based approaches in visualization evaluation and design.","article_number":"8305493","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8305493","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8305493/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8305493/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8629338,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"1 March 2019","start_page":"1474","end_page":"1488","citing_paper_count":29,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1393,"insert_date":"20180301","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Correlation","Visualization","Data visualization","Psychology","Feature extraction","Data models","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Information visualization","perception and psychophysics","evaluation/methodology","Weber's law","power law"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Features","Visual Characteristics","Log-linear","Linear Logistic Regression","Log-linear Model","Model Of Perception","Long-standing Hypothesis","Correlation Scatter Plots","Correlation Scatterplots","Participant Judgments","Linear Model","Linear Regression Model","Logarithm","Log Transformed","Logarithmic Transformation","Akaike Information Criterion","Akaike Criterion","Akaike Information Criteria","Use Of Features","Use Of Characteristics","Power Function","Supplementary Material Online","Stimulus Intensity","Differential Correlation","Correlation Model","Transformative Power","Discrimination Thresholds","Statistical Metrics","Computational Geometry","Geometric Calculations","Just Noticeable Difference","Just-noticeable-difference","Individual Variation In Performance","Standard Deviation Of Distance","Dispersion Of Points","Weber Fraction","Square Root Function","Square-root Function","Regression Diagnostics","Difference In Distance","Distance Deviation","Model Quality","Random Intercept"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2764895","title":"PhotoRecomposer: Interactive Photo Recomposition by Cropping","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"10","issn":"2160-9306","rank":61,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086449910","id":37086449910,"full_name":"Yuan Liang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085460249","id":37085460249,"full_name":"Xiting Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37654518100","id":37654518100,"full_name":"Song-Hai Zhang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37631235300","id":37631235300,"full_name":"Shi-Min Hu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406039100","id":37406039100,"full_name":"Shixia Liu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present a visual analysis method for interactively recomposing a large number of photos based on example photos with high-quality composition.

Many classification models exist, and choosing the right one for a given task is difficult. During model selection and debugging, data scientists need to assess classifiers' performances, evaluate their learning behavior over time, and compare different models. Typically, this analysis is based on single-number performance measures such as accuracy. A more detailed evaluation of classifiers is possible by inspecting class errors. The confusion matrix is an established way for visualizing these class errors, but it was not designed with temporal or comparative analysis in mind. More generally, established performance analysis systems do not allow a combined temporal and comparative analysis of class-level information. To address this issue, we propose ConfusionFlow, an interactive, comparative visualization tool that combines the benefits of class confusion matrices with the visualization of performance characteristics over time. ConfusionFlow is model-agnostic and can be used to compare performances for different model types, model architectures, and/or training and test datasets. We demonstrate the usefulness of ConfusionFlow in a case study on instance selection strategies in active learning. We further assess the scalability of ConfusionFlow and present a use case in the context of neural network pruning.","article_number":"9149790","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9149790","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9149790/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9149790/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9666754,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 Feb. 2022","start_page":"1222","end_page":"1236","citing_paper_count":21,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":947,"insert_date":"20200727","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Task analysis","Analytical models","Data models","Training","Tools","Adaptation models","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Classification","performance analysis","time series visualization","machine learning","information visualization","quality assessment"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Temporal Analysis","Classification Confusion","Comparative Analysis","Comparison Analysis","Neural Network","Scalable","Classification Model","Performance Measures","Active Learning","Confusion Matrix","Confusion Matrices","Learning Behavior","Learning Behaviour","Instance Selection","Training Set","Convolutional Neural Network","Machine Learning Models","Performance Metrics","Class Level","Category Level","Class Distribution","Sparse Matrix","Sparse Matrices","Dense Matrix","Analysis Tasks","Training Epochs","Pair Of Classes","Training Analysis","Line Chart","Detailed View","Machine Learning Tasks","Comparison Task","Labeling Process","CIFAR-100 Dataset","Training Folds","Training Step"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3018724","title":"ChartSeer: Interactive Steering Exploratory Visual Analysis With Machine Intelligence","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"2160-9306","rank":65,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38024987300","id":38024987300,"full_name":"Jian Zhao","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085512472","id":37085512472,"full_name":"Mingming Fan","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Twitter Inc, San Francisco, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085354408","id":37085354408,"full_name":"Mi Feng","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Twitter Inc, San Francisco, CA, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"During exploratory visual analysis (EVA), analysts need to continually determine which subsequent activities to perform, such as which data variables to explore or how to present data variables visually. Due to the vast combinations of data variables and visual encodings that are possible, it is often challenging to make such decisions. Further, while performing local explorations, analysts often fail to attend to the holistic picture that is emerging from their analysis, leading them to improperly steer their EVA. These issues become even more impactful in the real world analysis scenarios where EVA occurs in multiple asynchronous sessions that could be completed by one or more analysts. To address these challenges, this work proposes ChartSeer, a system that uses machine intelligence to enable analysts to visually monitor the current state of an EVA and effectively identify future activities to perform. ChartSeer utilizes deep learning techniques to characterize analyst-created data charts to generate visual summaries and recommend appropriate charts for further exploration based on user interactions. A case study was first conducted to demonstrate the usage of ChartSeer in practice, followed by a controlled study to compare ChartSeer’s performance with a baseline during EVA tasks. The results demonstrated that ChartSeer enables analysts to adequately understand current EVA status and advance their analysis by creating charts with increased coverage and visual encoding diversity.","article_number":"9174891","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9174891","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9174891/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9174891/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9695945,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 March 2022","start_page":"1500","end_page":"1513","citing_paper_count":19,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1457,"insert_date":"20200824","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Data visualization","Machine learning","Encoding","Task analysis","Semantics","Collaboration"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Exploratory visual analysis","interactive steering","visualization recommendation","machine learning"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Computational Intelligence","Machine Intelligence","Exploratory Visual Analysis","Interactive Steering","Deep Learning","Control Study","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Chart Data","Visual Encoding","Convolutional Neural Network","Years Of Experience","Dimensionality Reduction","Similar Variation","Similar Diversity","Deep Learning Models","Long Short-term Memory","Long Short Term Memory","LSTM","Exploratory Data","Latent Space","Embedding Space","State Analysis","Agglomerative Clustering","Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering","Variational Autoencoder","Gated Recurrent Unit","Unexplored Area","Empty Areas","2D Space","Context-free Grammar","Context Free Grammar","Collaborative Analysis","Semantic Space","Semantic Vectors","Parse Tree","Concrete Syntax","Derivation Tree","Design Considerations","Exploration Of Diversity","Exploration Of Variation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2876539","title":"The Effect of Color Scales on Climate Scientists’ Objective and Subjective Performance in Spatial Data Analysis Tasks","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"2160-9306","rank":66,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593202500","id":37593202500,"full_name":"Aritra Dasgupta","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Fundação Getulio Vargas, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38548192600","id":38548192600,"full_name":"Jorge Poco","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fundação Getulio Vargas, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","Universidad Católica San Pablo, Arequipa, Peru"]}},{"affiliation":"Visual Perspectives Research and Consulting, Ossining, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37332114400","id":37332114400,"full_name":"Bernice Rogowitz","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Perspectives Research and Consulting, Ossining, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086401560","id":37086401560,"full_name":"Kyungsik Han","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"New York University, New York, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38267713800","id":38267713800,"full_name":"Enrico Bertini","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University, New York, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"New York University, New York, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275249200","id":37275249200,"full_name":"Cláudio T.

Despite a plethora of evidence from the visualization and vision sciences literature about the shortcomings of the rainbow color scale, they continue to be preferred over perceptually optimal alternatives. To study and analyze this mismatch between theory and practice, we present a web-based user study that compares the effect of color scales on performance accuracy for climate-modeling tasks. In this study, we used pairs of continuous geographical maps generated using climatological metrics for quantifying pairwise magnitude difference and spatial similarity. For each pair of maps, 39 scientist-observers judged: i) the magnitude of their difference, ii) their degree of spatial similarity, and iii) the region of greatest dissimilarity between them. Besides the rainbow color scale, two other continuous color scales were chosen such that all three of them covaried two dimensions (luminance monotonicity and hue banding), hypothesized to have an impact on task performance. We also analyzed subjective performance measures, such as user confidence, perceived accuracy, preference, and familiarity in using the different color scales. We found that monotonic luminance scales produced significantly more accurate judgments of magnitude difference but were not superior in spatial comparison tasks, and that hue banding had differential effects based on the task and conditions. Scientists expressed the highest preference and perceived confidence and accuracy with the rainbow, despite its poor performance on the magnitude comparison tasks. We also report on interesting interactions among stimulus conditions, tasks, and color scales, that lead to open research questions.","article_number":"8494817","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8494817","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8494817/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8494817/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8974568,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"1 March 2020","start_page":"1577","end_page":"1591","citing_paper_count":19,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":947,"insert_date":"20181017","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image color analysis","Task analysis","Data visualization","Meteorology","Spatial databases","Data analysis","Visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","color maps","rainbow color map","user study"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Task Performance","Climatological","Climate Research","Climate Science","Scale Effect","Spatial Task","Objective Performance","Magnitude Of Differences","User Study","Climate Models","Climate Simulations","Cartographic","Comparison Task","Spatial Similarity","Web-based Study","Magnitude Comparison","Pair Of Maps","Spatial Comparison","Rainbow Color","Rainbow Colour","Root Mean Square Error","Root-mean-square Deviation","Root-mean-square Error","RMSD","RMSE","Confidence Level","Confidence Limits","Magnitude Of Change","Effect Of Experience","Gross Primary Production","Similar Spatial Distribution","Differences In The Spatial Distribution","Color-coded Maps","Colour-coded Maps","Equal Steps","Subjective Impression","High Level Of Confidence","Alternative Scales","Scope For Future Research","Scientific Visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3085327","title":"InfoColorizer: Interactive Recommendation of Color Palettes for Infographics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":67,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086598420","id":37086598420,"full_name":"Lin-Ping Yuan","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089576867","id":37089576867,"full_name":"Ziqi Zhou","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38024987300","id":38024987300,"full_name":"Jian Zhao","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089576300","id":37089576300,"full_name":"Yiqiu Guo","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Adobe Research, San Jose, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085829363","id":37085829363,"full_name":"Fan Du","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Adobe Research, San Jose, CA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"When designing infographics, general users usually struggle with getting desired color palettes using existing infographic authoring tools, which sometimes sacrifice customizability, require design expertise, or neglect the influence of elements’ spatial arrangement.

We build a recommendation engine by utilizing deep learning techniques to characterize good color design practices from data, and further develop InfoColorizer, a tool that allows users to obtain color palettes for their infographics in an interactive and dynamic manner. To validate our method, we conducted a comprehensive four-part evaluation, including case studies, a controlled user study, a survey study, and an interview study.

The number and type of crimes vary considerably around the city, assuming different patterns depending on urban and social characteristics of each particular location. Previous works have mostly focused on the analysis of crimes with the intent of uncovering patterns associated to social factors, seasonality, and urban routine activities. Therefore, those studies and tools are more global in the sense that they are not designed to investigate specific regions of the city such as particular neighborhoods, avenues, or public areas. Tools able to explore specific locations of the city are essential for domain experts to accomplish their analysis in a bottom-up fashion, revealing how urban features related to mobility, passersby behavior, and presence of public infrastructures (e.g., terminals of public transportation and schools) can influence the quantity and type of crimes. In this paper, we present CrimAnalyzer, a visual analytic tool that allows users to study the behavior of crimes in specific regions of a city. The system allows users to identify local hotspots and the pattern of crimes associated to them, while still showing how hotspots and corresponding crime patterns change overtime. CrimAnalyzer has been developed from the needs of a team of experts in criminology and deals with three major challenges: i) flexibility to explore local regions and understand their crime patterns, ii) identification of spatial crime hotspots that might not be the most prevalent ones in terms of the number of crimes but that are important enough to be investigated, and iii) understand the dynamic of crime patterns overtime. The effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed system are demonstrated by qualitative and quantitative comparisons as well as by case studies run by domain experts involving real data. The experiments show the capability of CrimAnalyzer in identifying crime-related phenomena.","article_number":"8869805","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8869805","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8869805/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8869805/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9363708,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 April 2021","start_page":"2313","end_page":"2328","citing_paper_count":16,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1342,"insert_date":"20191016","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Urban areas","Tools","Visual analytics","Self-organizing feature maps","Data visualization","Law enforcement"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Crime data","spatio-temporal data","visual analytics","non-negative matrix factorization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Crime Patterns","Visual Analysis","Visualization Tool","Domain Experts","City Region","Team Of Experts","Urban Quality","Urban Features","Urban Characteristics","Crime Types","Prevalent Ones","Visual Analytics Tool","Spatial Patterns","Spatiotemporal Patterns","Temporal Patterns","Highway","Freeway","Motorway","Sites In Region","Geographic Information System","Regional Patterns","Analysis Tasks","Non-negative Matrix Factorization","Set Of Sites","Spatiotemporal Analysis","Time Slice","Visual Resources","Self-organizing Map","Kohonen","Crime Data","Number Of Hotspots","Low-rank Approximation","Modifiable Areal Unit Problem","Map View","Basis Matrix","Basis Matrices","Ranking Of Factors"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.2981456","title":"ArchiText: Interactive Hierarchical Topic Modeling","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"9","issn":"2160-9306","rank":71,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085351744","id":37085351744,"full_name":"Hannah Kim","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Tech Research Institute, Atlanta, GA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37845636600","id":37845636600,"full_name":"Barry Drake","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Tech Research Institute, Atlanta, GA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681759500","id":37681759500,"full_name":"Alex Endert","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37277119500","id":37277119500,"full_name":"Haesun Park","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Human-in-the-loop topic modeling allows users to explore and steer the process to produce better quality topics that align with their needs.

However, this has limitations when the algorithms cannot be easily adapted to changes, and it is difficult to realize interactivity closely supported by underlying algorithms. Instead, we emphasize the concept of tight integration, which advocates for the need to co-develop interactive algorithms and interactive visual analytic systems in parallel to allow flexibility and scalability. In this article, we describe design goals for efficiently and effectively executing the concept of tight integration among computation, visualization, and interaction for hierarchical topic modeling of text data. We propose computational base operations for interactive tasks to achieve the design goals. To instantiate our concept, we present ArchiText, a prototype system for interactive hierarchical topic modeling, which offers fast, flexible, and algorithmically valid analysis via tight integration.

For example when the p-value is small enough or the CIs of the mean effects of a studied drug and a placebo are not overlapping, scientists tend to claim significant differences while often disregarding the magnitudes and absolute differences in the effect sizes. This type of reasoning has been shown to be potentially harmful to science. Techniques relying on the visual estimation of the strength of evidence have been recommended to reduce such dichotomous interpretations but their effectiveness has also been challenged. We ran two experiments on researchers with expertise in statistical analysis to compare several alternative representations of confidence intervals and used Bayesian multilevel models to estimate the effects of the representation styles on differences in researchers' subjective confidence in the results. We also asked the respondents' opinions and preferences in representation styles. Our results suggest that adding visual information to classic CI representation can decrease the tendency towards dichotomous interpretations - measured as the `cliff effect': the sudden drop in confidence around p-value 0.05 - compared with classic CI visualization and textual representation of the CI with p-values.

For typical feature definitions, such as vortices, objects are sparsely distributed over the data domain. In this paper, we present a novel approach for tracking both sparse and space-filling features. While the former comprise only a small fraction of the domain, the latter form a set of objects whose union covers the domain entirely while the individual objects are mutually disjunct. Our approach determines the assignment of features between two successive time-steps by solving two graph optimization problems. It first resolves one-to-one assignments of features by computing a maximum-weight, maximum-cardinality matching on a weighted bi-partite graph. Second, our algorithm detects events by creating a graph of potentially conflicting event explanations and finding a weighted, independent set in it. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on synthetic and simulation data sets, the former of which enables quantitative evaluation because of the availability of ground-truth information. Here, our method performs on par or better than a well-established reference algorithm. In addition, manual visual inspection by our collaborators confirm the results' plausibility for simulation data.","article_number":"8546802","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8546802","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8546802/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8546802/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9082800,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"1 June 2020","start_page":"2219","end_page":"2233","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":690,"insert_date":"20181127","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Feature extraction","Target tracking","Optimization","Data visualization","Data models","Analytical models","Heuristic algorithms"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Global optimization","simulation output analysis","flow visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Feature Tracking","Feature-tracking","Two-step Optimization","Visual Inspection","Characteristics Of Data","Features Of Data","Simulated Data","Plausibility","Temporal Evolution","Temporal Development","Independent Set","Simulated Datasets","Simulated Data Sets","Evolution Characteristics","Evolutionary Features","Definition Of Features","Definition Of Characteristics","Sparse Feature","Sparse Characteristics","Maximum Matching","Ground Truth Information","Reference Algorithm","Assignment Of Features","Time Step","Death Events","Death Effector","Event Detection","Single Feature","Single Characteristics","Splitting Events","Merging Events","Effect Of Merging","Birth Events","Effects Of Birth","Number Of Explanations","Sparse Set","Sparse Datasets","Sparse Data Sets","Set Of Explanations","Maximum Independent Set","Independence Number","Independent Set Problem","Red Objects"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2921323","title":"Visual Genealogy of Deep Neural Networks","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"11","issn":"2160-9306","rank":74,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543277","id":37086543277,"full_name":"Qianwen Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088514945","id":37088514945,"full_name":"Jun Yuan","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088516731","id":37088516731,"full_name":"Shuxin Chen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085416706","id":37085416706,"full_name":"Hang Su","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406039100","id":37406039100,"full_name":"Shixia Liu","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"A comprehensive and comprehensible summary of existing deep neural networks (DNNs) helps practitioners understand the behaviour and evolution of DNNs, offers insights for architecture optimization, and sheds light on the working mechanisms of DNNs. However, this summary is hard to obtain because of the complexity and diversity of DNN architectures. To address this issue, we develop DNN Genealogy, an interactive visualization tool, to offer a visual summary of representative DNNs and their evolutionary relationships. DNN Genealogy enables users to learn DNNs from multiple aspects, including architecture, performance, and evolutionary relationships. Central to this tool is a systematic analysis and visualization of 66 representative DNNs based on our analysis of 140 papers. A directed acyclic graph is used to illustrate the evolutionary relationships among these DNNs and highlight the representative DNNs. A focus + context visualization is developed to orient users during their exploration. A set of network glyphs is used in the graph to facilitate the understanding and comparing of DNNs in the context of the evolution. Case studies demonstrate that DNN Genealogy provides helpful guidance in understanding, applying, and optimizing DNNs. DNN Genealogy is extensible and will continue to be updated to reflect future advances in DNNs.","article_number":"8732351","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8732351","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8732351/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8732351/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9210268,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"1 Nov. 2020","start_page":"3340","end_page":"3352","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1113,"insert_date":"20190606","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Computer architecture","Tools","Neural networks","Interviews","Task analysis","Deep learning"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Interactive visual summary","information visualization","educational tool","deep neural networks"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Deep Neural Network","Evolutionary Relationships","Visualization Tool","Directed Acyclic Graph","Deep Neural Network Architecture","Interactive Visualization Tool","Convolutional Layers","Percentage Of Participants","Object Detection","Recurrent Neural Network","Educational Tool","Teaching Tool","Complex Architecture","Design Requirements","Skip Connections","AlexNet","Typical Architecture","Importance Scores","Faster R-CNN","Guidance Information","Degree Of Interest","Detail Layer","Details Of Each Layer","Frames Per Second","Google Trends","Beneficial Modulation","PASCAL VOC Dataset","Deep Generative Models","Deep Learning","Relevant Papers","Training Methods","Training Method"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3074023","title":"The Unmet Data Visualization Needs of Decision Makers Within Organizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":75,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Utrecht University, Utrecht, CS, Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085898406","id":37085898406,"full_name":"Evanthia Dimara","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Utrecht University, Utrecht, CS, Netherlands","University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089576760","id":37089576760,"full_name":"Harry Zhang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Tableau Software, Palo Alto, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275861300","id":37275861300,"full_name":"Melanie Tory","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tableau Software, Palo Alto, CA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077249100","id":37077249100,"full_name":"Steven Franconeri","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"When an organization chooses one course of action over alternatives, this task typically falls on a decision maker with relevant knowledge, experience, and understanding of context. Decision makers rely on data analysis, which is either delegated to analysts, or done on their own. Often the decision maker combines data, likely uncertain or incomplete, with non-formalized knowledge within a multi-objective problem space, weighing the recommendations of analysts within broader contexts and goals. As most past research in visual analytics has focused on understanding the needs and challenges of data analysts, less is known about the tasks and challenges of organizational decision makers, and how visualization support tools might help. Here we characterize the decision maker as a domain expert, review relevant literature in management theories, and report the results of an empirical survey and interviews with people who make organizational decisions. We identify challenges and opportunities for novel visualization tools, including trade-off overviews, scenario-based analysis, interrogation tools, flexible data input and collaboration support. Our findings stress the need to expand visualization design beyond data analysis into tools for information management.","article_number":"9408391","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9408391","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9408391/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9408391/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9930678,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 Dec. 2022","start_page":"4101","end_page":"4112","citing_paper_count":14,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1551,"insert_date":"20210419","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Decision making","Organizations","Business","Competitive intelligence","Data analysis","Uncertainty"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Decision making","visualization","interview","survey","organizations","management","business intelligence"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Decision-making","Decision Making","Data Visualization","Visual Analysis","Visualization Tool","Visual Design","Organizational Decision-making","Organizational Decision Makers","Decision-making Process","Decision Process","Use Of Information","Types Of Information","Clean Data","Management Research","Vision Research","Analysis Of Practices","Interactive Visualization","Different Types Of Information","Verbose","Wordy","Verbiage","Decision-making Support","Supported Decision Making","Use Of Interactions","Interactive Manipulation","Need For Guidance","Senior Executives","Chart Types","Misuse Of Information","Decision Phase","Disparate Sources","Spreadsheet Software","Questions In Mind"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2892483","title":"Exploring the Sensitivity of Choropleths under Attribute Uncertainty","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"8","issn":"2160-9306","rank":76,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086417230","id":37086417230,"full_name":"Zhaosong Huang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computing, Informatics & Decision Systems Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085342409","id":37085342409,"full_name":"Yafeng Lu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computing, Informatics & Decision Systems Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Geography, Michigan State University, East Lansing, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088433775","id":37088433775,"full_name":"Elizabeth A.

In this article, we work closely with the constructors of a new dataset, CGED-Q (China Government Employee Database-Qing), that records the career trajectories of over 340,000 government officials in the Qing bureaucracy in China from 1760 to 1912. We use these data to study career mobility from a historical perspective and understand social mobility and inequality. However, existing statistical approaches are inadequate for analyzing career mobility in this historical dataset with its fine-grained attributes and long time span, since they are mostly hypothesis-driven and require substantial effort. We propose CareerLens, an interactive visual analytics system for assisting experts in exploring, understanding, and reasoning from historical career data. With CareerLens, experts examine mobility patterns in three levels-of-detail, namely, the macro-level providing a summary of overall mobility, the meso-level extracting latent group mobility patterns, and the micro-level revealing social relationships of individuals. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of CareerLens through two case studies and receive encouraging feedback from follow-up interviews with domain experts.","article_number":"9382844","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9382844","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9382844/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9382844/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9874356,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 Oct. 2022","start_page":"3441","end_page":"3455","citing_paper_count":14,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2131,"insert_date":"20210322","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Engineering profession","Data visualization","History","Visual analytics","Social groups","Trajectory","Government"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Digital humanities","quantitative history","career mobility","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Career Mobility","Social Relationships","Bureaucratic","Visual System","Social Mobility","Political Mobilization","Domain Experts","Mobility Patterns","Historical Dataset","Historical Data Sets","Quantitative Datasets","Quantitative Data Sets","Latent Groups","Sequence Of Events","Interest Groups","Population Of Interest","Original Sequence","Individual Interests","Sequence Patterns","Career Path","Career Guidance","Career Counseling","Vertical Movement","Expert Interviews","Job Level","Population Flow","Flow Mode","Development Of Mobility","Evolution Of Mobility","Locality Sensitive Hashing","Locality-sensitive Hashing","Visual Design","Sequential Pattern Mining","Itemset Mining","Sequence Mining","County Administrative","Mobility Rate","Mobility Studies"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2833113","title":"A Scalable Hybrid Scheme for Ray-Casting of Unstructured Volume Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"7","issn":"2160-9306","rank":78,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Oregon, Eugene, OR","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086841066","id":37086841066,"full_name":"Roba Binyahib","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Oregon, Eugene, OR"]}},{"affiliation":"Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295026400","id":37295026400,"full_name":"Tom Peterka","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL"]}},{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085568281","id":37085568281,"full_name":"Matthew Larsen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California at Davis, Davis, CA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275869400","id":37275869400,"full_name":"Kwan-Liu Ma","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California at Davis, Davis, CA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Oregon, Eugene, OR","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37411882800","id":37411882800,"full_name":"Hank Childs","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Oregon, Eugene, OR"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present an algorithm for parallel volume rendering that is a hybrid between classical object order and image order techniques. The algorithm operates on unstructured grids (and structured ones), and thus can deal with block boundaries interleaving in complex ways. It also deals effectively with cases that are prone to load imbalance, i.e., cases where cell sizes differ dramatically, either because of the nature of the input data, or because of the effects of the camera transformation. The algorithm divides work over resources such that each phase of its processing is bounded in the amount of computation it can perform. We demonstrate its efficacy through a series of studies, varying over camera position, data set size, transfer function, image size, and processor count. At its biggest, our experiments scaled up to 8,192 processors and operated on data sets with more than one billion cells. In total, we find that our hybrid algorithm performs well in all cases. This is because our algorithm naturally adapts its computation based on workload, and can operate like either an object order technique or an image order technique in scenarios where those techniques are efficient.","article_number":"8354904","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8354904","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8354904/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8354904/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8723245,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"1 July 2019","start_page":"2349","end_page":"2361","citing_paper_count":14,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":561,"insert_date":"20180504","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Computer architecture","Microprocessors","Cameras","Data visualization","Load management","Equalizers"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Volume rendering","parallel visualization","large scale visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Scalable","Unstructured Data","Unstructured Information","Cell Size","Transfer Function","Image Size","Image Object","Amount Of Computation","Amount Of Calculation","Camera Position","Camera Locations","Hybrid Algorithm","Volume Rendering","Volumetric Rendering","Volume-rendering","Unstructured Grids","Load Imbalance","Small Cell","Small-cell","Large Cell","Distribution Of Cells","Parallelization","Parallel Computing","Hybrid Approach","Results Of Phase","Outcome Phase","Depth Information","Composite Image","Number Of Processors","Load Balancing","Total Execution Time","Message Passing Interface","Message-Passing Interface","Floating-point Values","Floating Point Values","Exchange Step","Hybrid Performance","Performance Of Hybrids","Memory Cost","Unstructured Mesh","Camera View"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3035823","title":"Rainbow Dash: Intuitiveness, Interpretability and Memorability of the Rainbow Color Scheme in Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"7","issn":"2160-9306","rank":79,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Faculty of Geography and Regional Studies, University of Warsaw, Warszawa, Poland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089407940","id":37089407940,"full_name":"Izabela M.

The abundant information on social media intensifies the competition of WeChat Public Official Articles (i.e., posts) for gaining user attention due to the zero-sum nature of attention. Therefore, only a small portion of information tends to become extremely popular while the rest remains unnoticed or quickly disappears. Such a typical “long-tail” phenomenon is very common in social media. Thus, recent years have witnessed a growing interest in predicting the future trend in the popularity of social media posts and understanding the factors that influence the popularity of the posts. Nevertheless, existing predictive models either rely on cumbersome feature engineering or sophisticated parameter tuning, which are difficult to understand and improve. In this paper, we study and enhance a point process-based model by incorporating visual reasoning to support communication between the users and the predictive model for a better prediction result. The proposed system supports users to uncover the working mechanism behind the model and improve the prediction accuracy accordingly based on the insights gained. We use realistic WeChat articles to demonstrate the effectiveness of the system and verify the improved model on a large scale of WeChat articles. We also elicit and summarize the feedback from WeChat domain experts.","article_number":"8451903","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8451903","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8451903/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8451903/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8946776,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"1 Feb. 2020","start_page":"1399","end_page":"1412","citing_paper_count":12,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1061,"insert_date":"20180830","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Predictive models","Social network services","Visual analytics","Analytical models","Feature extraction","Cognition"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual reasoning","propagation prediction","model understanding","information propagation visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Prediction Analysis","Visual Analysis","Information Cascades","WeChat Articles","Cascade Prediction","Prediction Model","Social Media","Social Platforms","Domain Experts","Feature Engineering","Visual Reasoning","Social Networks","Prediction Results","Predictor Of Outcomes","Final Size","Phase Velocity","Phase Speed","Propagation Velocity","Propagation Speed","Absolute Percentage Error","Information Propagation","Generation Of Information","Article Type","Post Time","Post-intervention Time","Visual Approach","Number Of Friends","Mean Degree","Percentage Of Articles","Feature-based Models","Seismic Model","Days In November","Popular Articles","Direct Messages","Visual Design","Propagation Patterns","Visual Encoding"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3076222","title":"Nebula: A Coordinating Grammar of Graphics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":81,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086544177","id":37086544177,"full_name":"Ran Chen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086245904","id":37086245904,"full_name":"Xinhuan Shu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100248","id":37087100248,"full_name":"Jiahui Chen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085887051","id":37085887051,"full_name":"Di Weng","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655779","id":37088655779,"full_name":"Junxiu Tang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085458481","id":37085458481,"full_name":"Siwei Fu","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","id":37407308300,"full_name":"Yingcai Wu","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In multiple coordinated views (MCVs), visualizations across views update their content in response to users’ interactions in other views.

To bridge the gap, we contribute Nebula, a grammar based on natural language for coordinating visualizations in MCVs.

With the framework, Nebula specification formalizes coordination as a composition of user- and coordination-triggered interactions in origin and destination views, respectively, along with potential data transformation between the interactions.

Our analyses show that using a virtual reality-based memory palace variant greatly increased the amount of knowledge retrieved and retained over the baseline, and it shows a moderate improvement over the other image-based memory palace variant. Anecdotal feedback from participants suggested that personalizing a memory palace variant would be appreciated.

Coordinated relationships can be formalized as biclusters. In order to support visual exploration of biclusters, bipartite graphs based visualizations have been proposed, and edge bundling is used to show biclusters. However, it suffers from edge crossings due to possible overlaps of biclusters, and lacks in-depth understanding of its impact on user exploring biclusters in bipartite graphs. To address these, we propose a novel bicluster-based seriation technique that can reduce edge crossings in bipartite graphs drawing and conducted a user experiment to study the effect of edge bundling and this proposed technique on visualizing biclusters in bipartite graphs. We found that they both had impact on reducing entity visits for users exploring biclusters, and edge bundles helped them find more justified answers. Moreover, we identified four key trade-offs that inform the design of future bicluster visualizations. The study results suggest that edge bundling is critical for exploring biclusters in bipartite graphs, which helps to reduce low-level perceptual problems and support high-level inferences.","article_number":"8423100","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8423100","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8423100/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8423100/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8822577,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"1 Oct. 2019","start_page":"2983","end_page":"2998","citing_paper_count":11,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":604,"insert_date":"20180730","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Bipartite graph","Layout","Image edge detection","Bioinformatics","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Bicluster","edge bundling","seriation","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Edge Bundling","Post Hoc Test","Post Hoc Analysis","Semantic","Random Order","Time Cost","Accurate Determination","Tukey Post-hoc Test","Spatial Proximity","Correspondence Analysis","Weak Connections","Connectivity Graph","Global Order","Related Entities","User Performance","List Of Pairs","User Tasks","Group Of Entities","Individual Edges","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","IT Companies","User Effort","Fewer Edges"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2940026","title":"Why Visualize?

In addition, examples of misleading usages of visualizations in information communication have occasionally been pointed out. Thus, to contribute to the fundamental understanding of our discipline, we require a comprehensive collection of arguments on “why visualize?” (or “why not?”), untangling the rationale behind positive and negative viewpoints. In this paper, we report a theoretical study to understand the underlying reasons of various arguments; their relationships (e.g., built-on, and conflict); and their respective dependencies on tasks, users, and data. We curated an argumentative network based on a collection of arguments from various fields, including information visualization, cognitive science, psychology, statistics, philosophy, and others. Our work proposes several categorizations for the arguments, and makes their relations explicit.

These events implicitly propagate across space and time by following cascading patterns, expanding their influence, and generating event cascades that involve multiple locations. Analyzing such cascading processes presents valuable implications in various urban applications, such as traffic planning and pollution diagnostics. Motivated by the limited capability of the existing approaches in mining and interpreting cascading patterns, we propose a visual analytics system called VisCas. VisCas combines an inference model with interactive visualizations and empowers analysts to infer and interpret the latent cascading patterns in the spatiotemporal context. To develop VisCas, we address three major challenges 1) generalized pattern inference; 2) implicit influence visualization; and 3) multifaceted cascade analysis. For the first challenge, we adapt the state-of-the-art cascading network inference technique to general urban scenarios, where cascading patterns can be reliably inferred from large-scale spatiotemporal data. For the second and third challenges, we assemble a set of effective visualizations to support location navigation, influence inspection, and cascading exploration, and facilitate the in-depth cascade analysis. We design a novel influence view based on a three-fold optimization strategy for analyzing the implicit influences of the inferred patterns. We demonstrate the capability and effectiveness of VisCas with two case studies conducted on real-world traffic congestion and air pollution datasets with domain experts.","article_number":"9397369","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9397369","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9397369/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9397369/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9766250,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 June 2022","start_page":"2486","end_page":"2499","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1177,"insert_date":"20210406","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Spatiotemporal phenomena","Air pollution","Probabilistic logic","Adaptation models","Visual analytics","Time series analysis","Sensors"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Spatial cascade","pattern mining","spatiotemporal data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Spatiotemporal Data","Large-scale Spatiotemporal Data","Large Scale Spatio-temporal Data","Interactive","Time And Space","Spacetime","Air Pollution","Visual Analysis","Cascade Of Events","Cascading Effects","Traffic Congestion","Traffic Density","Traffic Jams","Domain Experts","Network Inference","General Scenario","Traffic Pollution","Spatiotemporal Effects","Spatiotemporal Events","Traffic Air Pollution","Cascade Network","Urban Applications","Time Series","Time-series","Horizontal Plane","Horizontal Direction","Horizontal Distance","Start Time","Dynamic Time Warping","Inherent Relationship","Effect Of Infection","Consequences Of Infection","Infection Events","Congested","Effects Of Air Pollution","Central Location","Visual Design","Traffic Events","Traffic Effects","Massive Data"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3045918","title":"embComp: Visual Interactive Comparison of Vector Embeddings","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"8","issn":"2160-9306","rank":86,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison), Madison, WI, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490630000","id":38490630000,"full_name":"Florian Heimerl","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison), Madison, WI, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Faculty of Computer Sciences and Data Science, Uni Vienna Sensengasse 6, University of Vienna, Wien, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088662618","id":37088662618,"full_name":"Christoph Kralj","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Faculty of Computer Sciences and Data Science, Uni Vienna Sensengasse 6, University of Vienna, Wien, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Faculty of Computer Sciences and Data Science, Uni Vienna Sensengasse 6, University of Vienna, Wien, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275858700","id":37275858700,"full_name":"Torsten Möller","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Faculty of Computer Sciences and Data Science, Uni Vienna Sensengasse 6, University of Vienna, Wien, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison), Madison, WI, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282585700","id":37282585700,"full_name":"Michael Gleicher","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison), Madison, WI, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"This article introduces embComp, a novel approach for comparing two embeddings that capture the similarity between objects, such as word and document embeddings.

Summarizing these local metrics over the embeddings provides global overviews of similarities and differences. Detail views allow comparison of the local structure around selected objects and relating this local information to the global views.

A cartogram is called contiguous if it conforms to this area principle while also keeping neighboring regions connected. Because of their distorted appearance, contiguous cartograms have been criticized as difficult to read. Some authors have suggested that cartograms may be more legible if they are accompanied by interactive features (e.g., animations, linked brushing, or infotips). We conducted an experiment to evaluate this claim. Participants had to perform visual analysis tasks with interactive and noninteractive contiguous cartograms. The task types covered various aspects of cartogram readability, ranging from elementary lookup tasks to synoptic tasks (i.e., tasks in which participants had to summarize high-level differences between two cartograms). Elementary tasks were carried out equally well with and without interactivity. Synoptic tasks, by contrast, were more difficult without interactive features. With access to interactivity, however, most participants answered even synoptic questions correctly. In a subsequent survey, participants rated the interactive features as “easy to use” and “helpful.” Our study suggests that interactivity has the potential to make contiguous cartograms accessible even for those readers who are unfamiliar with interactive computer graphics or do not have a prior affinity to working with maps. Among the interactive features, animations had the strongest positive effect, so we recommend them as a minimum of interactivity when contiguous cartograms are displayed on a computer screen.","article_number":"9275378","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9275378","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9275378/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9275378/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340102,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 March 2021","start_page":"2136","end_page":"2152","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1255,"insert_date":"20201201","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Task analysis","Economic indicators","Data visualization","Animation","Switches","Software","Shape"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Cartogram","geovisualization","interactive data exploration","quantitative evaluation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Task Force","Advisory Committee","Gross Domestic Product","Computer Screen","Types Of Tasks","Regional Mapping","Neighboring Regions","Neighbouring Regions","Interaction Graph","Error Rate","Response Time","Change Detection","McNemar Test","Colorblind","Color Blindness","Colour-blind","Color Vision Deficiency","Mapping Project","Spatial Projection","Still Images","World Wide Web","Conventional Function","Conventional Mapping","Morphing","Accuracy Of Participants","Accuracy For Each Participant","Increase In Response Time","Mean Error Rate","Screen Recordings","Preliminary Questions","Data Analysis Tasks","Response Time Distributions"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3011155","title":"Visual Analysis of Class Separations With Locally Linear Segments","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":89,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Computing, Informatics & Decision Systems Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101494","id":37087101494,"full_name":"Yuxin Ma","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computing, Informatics & Decision Systems Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computing, Informatics & Decision Systems Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396008400","id":37396008400,"full_name":"Ross Maciejewski","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computing, Informatics & Decision Systems Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"High-dimensional labeled data widely exists in many real-world applications such as classification and clustering. One main task in analyzing such datasets is to explore class separations and class boundaries derived from machine learning models. Dimension reduction techniques are commonly applied to support analysts in exploring the underlying decision boundary structures by depicting a low-dimensional representation of the data distributions from multiple classes. However, such projection-based analyses are limited due to their lack of ability to show separations in complex non-linear decision boundary structures and can suffer from heavy distortion and low interpretability. To overcome these issues of separability and interpretability, we propose a visual analysis approach that utilizes the power of explainability from linear projections to support analysts when exploring non-linear separation structures. Our approach is to extract a set of locally linear segments that approximate the original non-linear separations. Unlike traditional projection-based analysis where the data instances are mapped to a single scatterplot, our approach supports the exploration of complex class separations through multiple local projection results. We conduct case studies on two labeled datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","article_number":"9146191","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9146191","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9146191/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9146191/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9269519,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 Jan. 2021","start_page":"241","end_page":"253","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":932,"insert_date":"20200722","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Dimensionality reduction","Data visualization","Visualization","Analytical models","Manifolds","Data models","Support vector machines"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual analysis","dimension reduction","class separation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Class Separation","Local Linear","Machine Learning","Machine-learning","Dimensionality Reduction","Decision Boundary","Data Instances","Instantaneous Data","Visual Approach","Class Boundaries","Nonlinear Structure","Linear Projection","Nonlinear Boundary","Feature Space","Linear Method","Linear Methods","Class Labels","Hyperplane","Projection Matrix","Matrix Operations","Projection Matrices","Linear Support Vector Machine","Linear SVM","Class Instances","Linearly Separable","t-SNE Projection","Entire Boundary","Projection Views","Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms","Exploration Path","Linear Boundary","Parallel Coordinates","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Neighboring Segments","Visual Framework"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3068337","title":"Declutter and Focus: Empirically Evaluating Design Guidelines for Effective Data Communication","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"10","issn":"2160-9306","rank":90,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089513334","id":37089513334,"full_name":"Kiran Ajani","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Information, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088450881","id":37088450881,"full_name":"Elsie Lee","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Information, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"CICS, UMass Amherst, Amherst, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102197","id":37087102197,"full_name":"Cindy Xiong","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["CICS, UMass Amherst, Amherst, MA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Storytelling with Data, Milwaukee, WI, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089512640","id":37089512640,"full_name":"Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Storytelling with Data, Milwaukee, WI, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089513768","id":37089513768,"full_name":"William Kemper","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077249100","id":37077249100,"full_name":"Steven Franconeri","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Data visualization design has a powerful effect on which patterns we see as salient and how quickly we see them. The visualization practitioner community prescribes two popular guidelines for creating clear and efficient visualizations: declutter and focus. The declutter guidelines suggest removing non-critical gridlines, excessive labeling of data values, and color variability to improve aesthetics and to maximize the emphasis on the data relative to the design itself. The focus guidelines for explanatory communication recommend including a clear headline that describes the relevant data pattern, highlighting a subset of relevant data values with a unique color, and connecting those values to written annotations that contextualize them in a broader argument. We evaluated how these recommendations impact recall of the depicted information across cluttered, decluttered, and decluttered+focused designs of six graph topics. Undergraduate students were asked to redraw previously seen visualizations, to recall their topics and main conclusions, and to rate the varied designs on aesthetics, clarity, professionalism, and trustworthiness. Decluttering designs led to higher ratings on professionalism, and adding focus to the design led to higher ratings on aesthetics and clarity. They also showed better memory for the highlighted pattern in the data, as reflected across redrawings of the original visualization and typed free-response conclusions, though we do not know whether these results would generalize beyond our memory-based tasks.

Despite the enhanced performance and efficiency of HFL over local training, clues for inspecting the behaviors of the participating clients and the federated model are usually lacking due to the privacy-preserving nature of HFL. Consequently, the users can only conduct a shallow-level analysis of potential abnormal behaviors and have limited means to assess the contributions of individual clients and implement the necessary intervention. Visualization techniques have been introduced to facilitate the HFL process inspection, usually by providing model metrics and evaluation results as a dashboard representation. Although the existing visualization methods allow a simple examination of the HFL model performance, they cannot support the intensive exploration of the HFL process. In this article, strictly following the HFL privacy-preserving protocol, we design an exploratory visual analytics system for the HFL process termed HFLens, which supports comparative visual interpretation at the overview, communication round, and client instance levels. Specifically, the proposed system facilitates the investigation of the overall process involving all clients, the correlation analysis of clients’ information in one or different communication round(s), the identification of potential anomalies, and the contribution assessment of each HFL client. Two case studies confirm the efficacy of our system. Experts’ feedback suggests that our approach indeed helps in understanding and diagnosing the HFL process better.","article_number":"9408377","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9408377","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9408377/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9408377/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9930678,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 Dec. 2022","start_page":"4085","end_page":"4100","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1271,"insert_date":"20210419","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data models","Data visualization","Federated learning","Predictive models","Analytical models","Computational modeling","Servers","Anomaly detection"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Federated learning","anomaly detection","contribution assessment","visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Federated Learning","Machine Learning","Machine-learning","Model Performance","Machine Learning Models","Visual System","Local Devices","Device Position","Local Training","Communication Rounds","Potential Anomalies","Training Dataset","Training Data Set","Federation","Object Detection","Start Time","Domain Experts","Anomaly Detection","Accuracy Metrics","Conventional Practices","Accurate Distribution","Loss Distribution","Visual Design","Consecutive Rounds","Projection Views","Training Round","Fine-tuned Model","Client Data","Run Duration","Duration Of Each Run","Histogram Of Gradients","Node Ratio","Interpretable Machine Learning","View Of Analysis"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3051632","title":"Tracking Internal Frames of Reference for Consistent Molecular Distribution Functions","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"9","issn":"2160-9306","rank":93,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Scientific Visualization Group, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085725481","id":37085725481,"full_name":"Robin Skånberg","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Scientific Visualization Group, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden","Swedish e-Science Research Centre (SeRC), Stockholm, Sweden"]}},{"affiliation":"Scientific Visualization Group, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37565763500","id":37565763500,"full_name":"Martin Falk","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Scientific Visualization Group, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden","Swedish e-Science Research Centre (SeRC), Stockholm, Sweden"]}},{"affiliation":"Scientific Visualization Group, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089166851","id":37089166851,"full_name":"Mathieu Linares","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Scientific Visualization Group, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden","Swedish e-Science Research Centre (SeRC), Stockholm, Sweden","Laboratory of Organic Electronics, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden"]}},{"affiliation":"Scientific Visualization Group, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284192000","id":37284192000,"full_name":"Anders Ynnerman","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Scientific Visualization Group, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden","Swedish e-Science Research Centre (SeRC), Stockholm, Sweden"]}},{"affiliation":"Scientific Visualization Group, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282721800","id":37282721800,"full_name":"Ingrid Hotz","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Scientific Visualization Group, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden","Swedish e-Science Research Centre (SeRC), Stockholm, Sweden"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In molecular analysis, spatial distribution functions (SDF) are fundamental instruments in answering questions related to spatial occurrences and relations of atomic structures over time. Given a molecular trajectory, SDFs can, for example, reveal the occurrence of water in relation to particular structures and hence provide clues of hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. For the computation of meaningful distribution functions, the definition of molecular reference structures is essential. Therefore we introduce the concept of an internal frame of reference (IFR) for labeled point sets that represent selected molecular structures, and we propose an algorithm for tracking the IFR over time and space using a variant of Kabsch’s algorithm. This approach lets us generate a consistent space for the aggregation of the SDF for molecular trajectories and molecular ensembles. We demonstrate the usefulness of the technique by applying it to temporal molecular trajectories as well as ensemble datasets. The examples include different docking scenarios with DNA, insulin, and aspirin.","article_number":"9324971","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9324971","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9324971/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9324971/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9844883,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 Sept. 2022","start_page":"3126","end_page":"3137","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":310,"insert_date":"20210114","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Distribution functions","Trajectory","Visualization","Graphical models","Numerical models","Shape","Periodic structures"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Molecule visualization","molecular dynamics","interactive exploration"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Distribution Function","Reference Frame","Internal Frame","Insulin","Molecular Structure","Spatial Relationship","Atomic Structure","Relative Water","Reference Structure","Hydrophilic Region","Molecular Trajectories","Molecular Dynamics","Molecular Dynamics Simulations","Center Of Mass","Center-of-mass","Center Of Gravity","Diffusion Tensor Imaging","Diffusion-weighted Imaging","Diffusion Weighted Imaging","Diffusion Tensor","Singular Value Decomposition","Simulated Structure","Amyloid Fibrils","Interactive Tool","Structures Of Interest","Rigid Body Transformation","Rigid-body Transformation","Trajectory Frames","Polar Decomposition","Case Of Structure","Original Frame","Relational Coordination","Newton’s Second Law","Newton’s Law","Common Reference Frame","Translation Vector","Equivalent Structure"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2848906","title":"A Model of Spatial Directness in Interactive Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"8","issn":"2160-9306","rank":94,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Bergen, Norway, Bergen, Norway","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37265895700","id":37265895700,"full_name":"Stefan Bruckner","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bergen, Norway, Bergen, Norway"]}},{"affiliation":"Université Paris-Saclay, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37297057400","id":37297057400,"full_name":"Tobias Isenberg","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Université Paris-Saclay, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Ulm University, Ulm, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295281400","id":37295281400,"full_name":"Timo Ropinski","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Hochschule Worms University of Applied Sciences, Worms, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37565763400","id":37565763400,"full_name":"Alexander Wiebel","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hochschule Worms University of Applied Sciences, Worms, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We discuss the concept of directness in the context of spatial interaction with visualization.

To reach these goals, we distinguish between different types of directness. Each type of directness depends on a particular mapping between different spaces, for which we consider the data space, the visualization space, the output space, the user space, the manipulation space, and the interaction space. In addition to the introduction of the model itself, we also show how to apply it to several real-world interaction scenarios in visualization, and thus discuss the resulting types of spatial directness, without recommending either more direct or more indirect interaction techniques.

Our article explores the efficacy of recommendation categories by formalizing a taxonomy of common categories and developing a system, Frontier, that implements these categories. Using Frontier, we evaluate workflow strategies adopted by users and how categories influence those strategies. Participants found recommendations that add attributes to enhance the current visualization and recommendations that filter to sub-populations to be comparatively most useful during data exploration.

Our object-space lenses follow the surface geometry and allow the user to change the point of view during data exploration while maintaining a spatial reference to positions where one or more lenses were placed. Each lens delimits specific regions of the surface where one or more attributes can be selected or combined. Similar to 2D lenses, the user interacts with our lenses in real-time, switching between different attributes within the lens context. The user can also visualize the surface data representations from the point of view of each lens by using local cameras. To place lenses on surfaces of intricate geometry, such as the human brain, we introduce the concept of support surfaces for designing interaction techniques. Support surfaces provide a way to place and interact with the lenses while avoiding holes and occluded regions during data exploration. We further extend decal-lenses to arbitrary regions using brushing and lassoing operations. We discuss the applicability of our technique and present several examples where our lenses can be useful to create a customized exploration of multivariate data on surfaces.","article_number":"8396300","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8396300","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8396300/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8396300/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8750990,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"1 Aug. 2019","start_page":"2568","end_page":"2582","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":546,"insert_date":"20180626","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Lenses","Data visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Two dimensional displays","Geometry","Correlation","Cameras"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Focus+context","lenses","interaction","design","multivariate","visualization","surfaces","decal"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive","Exploratory Data","Multivariate Data","Multivariate Statistics","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Surface Region","Surface Geometry","Interaction Techniques","Occluded Regions","Arbitrary Surface","Visual Information","Bounding Box","Visual Feedback","Video Feedback","Color Map","Colour Map","Colormap","Rock Types","Different Points Of View","Brain Surface","Objective Space","Depth Perception","Depth Cues","3D Datasets","3D Data Sets","Principal Plane","Center Of The Lens","Optical Center","Multiple Lenses","Multiple Lens","Mean Curvature","Lens Position","Screen Space","Use Of Lenses","Lens Use","Scientific Visualization","Radial Coordinate","Permeability Tensor","Gaussian Curvature","Surface Reservoirs"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.2975583","title":"HyperLabels: Browsing of Dense and Hierarchical Molecular 3D Models","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"8","issn":"2160-9306","rank":97,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"TU Wien, Wien, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086238484","id":37086238484,"full_name":"David Kouřil","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Wien, Wien, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"CNRS, Inria, LRI, Université Paris-Saclay, Saint-Aubin, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37297057400","id":37297057400,"full_name":"Tobias Isenberg","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["CNRS, Inria, LRI, Université Paris-Saclay, Saint-Aubin, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085711031","id":37085711031,"full_name":"Barbora Kozlíková","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564728700","id":37564728700,"full_name":"Miriah Meyer","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Wien, Wien, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282552200","id":37282552200,"full_name":"M.

Our approach is motivated by large molecular models, for which the traditional single-scale navigational metaphors are not suitable. Multi-scale phenomena, e. g., in astronomy or geography, are complex to navigate due to their large data spaces and multi-level organization. Models from structural biology are in addition also densely crowded in space and scale. Cutaways are needed to show individual model subparts. The camera has to support exploration on the level of a whole virus, as well as on the level of a small molecule. We address these challenges by employing HyperLabels: active labels that—in addition to their annotational role—also support user interaction. Clicks on HyperLabels select the next structure to be explored. Then, we adjust the visualization to showcase the inner composition of the selected subpart and enable further exploration. Finally, we use a breadcrumbs panel for orientation and as a mechanism to traverse upwards in the model hierarchy. We demonstrate our concept of hierarchical 3D model browsing using two exemplary models from meso-scale biology.","article_number":"9007694","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9007694","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9007694/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9007694/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9468994,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 Aug. 2021","start_page":"3493","end_page":"3504","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1106,"insert_date":"20200224","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three-dimensional displays","Navigation","Data visualization","Biological system modeling","Solid modeling","Cameras"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Scientific visualization","navigation","3D molecular data","multi-scale data","hierarchical data","HyperLabels"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Molecular Modeling","Hierarchical Model","Density Model","3D Density","Hierarchical Structure","Hierarchical Organization","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Structural Biology","3D Visualization","Hierarchy Model","Satellite","Orbit","Years Of Experience","Human Immunodeficiency Virus","Feature Model","Characteristics Of Model","Spatial Structure","Object Of Interest","Domain Experts","Interactive Visualization","Structures Of Interest","3D Environment","Multiscale Model","Focal Object","Object Focus","Focusing Objective","Text Labels","Interactive Exploration","Camera Position","Camera Locations","Screen Space","Scientific Visualization","Web Browsing","Temporal Coherence","Center Of The Sphere","Camera Control"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2912752","title":"Interactive Visualization and On-Demand Processing of Large Volume Data: A Fully GPU-Based Out-of-Core Approach","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"10","issn":"2160-9306","rank":98,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Université de Reims Champagne-Ardenne, Reims, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086048544","id":37086048544,"full_name":"Jonathan Sarton","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Université de Reims Champagne-Ardenne, Reims, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Université de Reims Champagne-Ardenne, Reims, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086051907","id":37086051907,"full_name":"Nicolas Courilleau","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Université de Reims Champagne-Ardenne, Reims, France","Neoxia, Paris, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Université de Reims Champagne-Ardenne, Reims, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37321419400","id":37321419400,"full_name":"Yannick Remion","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Université de Reims Champagne-Ardenne, Reims, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Université de Reims Champagne-Ardenne, Reims, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38039201300","id":38039201300,"full_name":"Laurent Lucas","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Université de Reims Champagne-Ardenne, Reims, France"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In a wide range of scientific fields, 3D datasets production capabilities have widely evolved in recent years, especially with the rapid increase in their sizes. As a result, many large-scale applications, including visualization or processing, have become challenging to address. A solution to this issue lies in providing out-of-core algorithms specifically designed to handle datasets significantly larger than memory. In this article, we present a new approach that extends the broad interactive addressing principles already established in the field of out-of-core volume rendering on GPUs to allow on-demand processing during the visualization stage. We propose a pipeline designed to manage data as regular 3D grids regardless of the underlying application. It relies on a caching approach with a virtual memory addressing system coupled to an efficient parallel management on GPU to provide efficient access to data in interactive time. It allows any visualization or processing application to leverage the flexibility of its structure by managing multi-modality datasets. Furthermore, we show that our system delivers good performance on a single standard PC with low memory budget on the GPU.","article_number":"8695851","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8695851","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8695851/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8695851/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9184388,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"1 Oct. 2020","start_page":"3008","end_page":"3021","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":781,"insert_date":"20190423","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Graphics processing units","Data visualization","Pipelines","Memory management","Three-dimensional displays","Rendering (computer graphics)","Casting"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["GPU","caching system","out-of-core data management","large data","interactive visualization","on-demand processing"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Large Volumes Of Data","Interactive Visualization","On-demand Processing","Regular Grid","Cartesian Grid","Grid Structure","Rectangular Grid","Vision Applications","Caching","Volume Rendering","Volumetric Rendering","Volume-rendering","Virtual Memory","Data Management","Intermediate Levels","Work Settings","Tree Structure","Tree-structured","Partial Volume","Volume Size","Size Intensity","Level Of Resolution","Hash Function","Hash Table","Hash Value","Hash Codes","Voxel Values","Value Of Each Voxel","GPU Memory","Convolution Process","Compressed Format","Data Cache","Shared Cache","CPU Cache","Cache Misses","Cache-miss","Mass Storage","Ray Casting","Ray Shooting","Race Conditions","Volume Dimensions","End-use Applications","CPU Memory","Block Size","Screen Space"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3050118","title":"Affective Congruence in Visualization Design: Influences on Reading Categorical Maps","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"8","issn":"2160-9306","rank":99,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Katz Graduate School of Business, Marketing and Business Economics Area, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089438912","id":37089438912,"full_name":"Cary L.

Data that are mapped or otherwise visualized are also often emotive in nature, either inherently (e.g., climate change, disease mortality rates), or by design, such as can be found in visual storytelling. However, little is known about how the affective qualities of color interact with those of data context in visualization design. This article describes the results of a crowdsourced study on the influence of affectively congruent versus incongruent color schemes on categorical map-reading response. We report both objective (pattern detection; area comparison) and subjective (affective quality; appropriateness; preference) measures of map-reader response. Our results suggest that affectively congruent colors amplify perceptions of the affective qualities of maps with emotive topics, affective incongruence may cause confusion, and that affective congruence is particularly influential in maps of positive-leaning data topics. Finally, we offer preliminary design recommendations for balancing color congruence with other design factors, and for synthesizing color and affective context in thematic map design.","article_number":"9318559","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9318559","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9318559/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9318559/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9811523,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 Aug. 2022","start_page":"2867","end_page":"2878","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":824,"insert_date":"20210108","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image color analysis","Data visualization","Visualization","Cartography","Climate change"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Color","visualization","emotion","design","cartography"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Classification Maps","Visual Design","Affective Congruence","Data Visualization","Thematic Map","Color Scheme","Colour Scheme","Affective Qualities","Affective Character","Color Palette","Colour Palette","Map Design","Cartographic Design","Emotional Themes","Emotional Topics","Emotional Subjectivities","Semantic","Response Time","Read Mapping","Mapping Data","Color Map","Colour Map","Colormap","Sequence Mapping","Desserts","Relaxation Techniques","Relaxation Training","Relaxation Therapy","Relaxation Exercises","Congruency Effect","Color Assignment","Colour Assignment","Choropleth Maps","Emotional Connotations","Perceptual Content","Radio Buttons","Preference Ratings","Preferred Rate","ArcGIS Pro","Caffeinated Beverages","Caffeinated Drinks","Part Of Goal","Core Affect"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3064037","title":"A State-of-the-Art Survey of Tasks for Tree Design and Evaluation With a Curated Task Dataset","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"10","issn":"2160-9306","rank":100,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085662710","id":37085662710,"full_name":"Aditeya Pandey","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088642947","id":37088642947,"full_name":"Uzma Haque Syeda","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089513547","id":37089513547,"full_name":"Chaitya Shah","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077487100","id":37077487100,"full_name":"John A.

In this article, we focus on the collection of tasks for tree visualizations, a common visual encoding in many domains ranging from biology to computer science to geography. In spite of their commonality, no prior efforts exist to collect and abstractly define tree visualization tasks. We present a literature review of tree visualization articles and generate a curated dataset of over 200 tasks. To enable effective task abstraction for trees, we also contribute a novel extension of the Multi-Level Task Typology to include more specificity to support tree-specific tasks as well as a systematic procedure to conduct task abstractions for tree visualizations. All tasks in the dataset were abstracted with the novel typology extension and analyzed to gain a better understanding of the state of tree visualizations. These abstracted tasks can benefit visualization researchers and practitioners as they design evaluation studies or compare their analytical tasks with ones previously studied in the literature to make informed decisions about their design. We also reflect on our novel methodology and advocate more broadly for the creation of task-based knowledge repositories for different types of visualizations.

Clustered graphs are often used to model relationships that are accompanied by attribute-based grouping information. Such information is essential for robust data analysis, such as for the study of biological taxonomies or educational backgrounds. Hence, the ability to smartly arrange textual labels and packing graphs within a certain screen space is therefore desired to successfully convey the attribute data . Here we propose to hierarchically partition the input screen space using Voronoi tessellations in multiple levels of detail. In our method, the position of textual labels is guided by the blending of constrained forces and the forces derived from centroidal Voronoi cells. The proposed algorithm considers three main factors: (1) area balancing, (2) schematized space partitioning, and (3) hairball management. We primarily focus on area balancing, which aims to allocate a uniform area for each textual label in the diagram. We achieve this by first untangling a general graph to a clustered graph through textual label duplication, and then coupling with spanning-tree-like visual integration. We illustrate the feasibility of our approach with examples and then evaluate our method by comparing it with well-known conventional approaches and collecting feedback from domain experts.","article_number":"9262073","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9262073","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9262073/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9262073/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9782589,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 July 2022","start_page":"2682","end_page":"2696","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1157,"insert_date":"20201117","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Layout","Visualization","Clustering algorithms","Data visualization","Shape","Partitioning algorithms","Chemical elements"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Graph drawing","Voronoi tessellation","multi-level","spatially-efficient layout"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Domain Experts","Voronoi Diagram","Voronoi Tessellation","Voronoi Cell","Spatial Partitioning","Partition Of Space","Text Labels","Screen Space","Metabolic Pathways","Molecular Pathways","Complex Network","Aspect Ratio","Entire Network","Topological Structure","Repulsive Forces","Attractive Forces","Balanced Distribution","Visibility Graph","Postdoctoral Research","Idea Of Algorithm","Spanning Tree","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Planar Graphs","Planar Maps","Graph Layout","Graph Drawing","Ideal Length","Ideal Lengths","Pathway Diagrams","Final Layout","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Contiguous Clusters","Visual Representation","Input Graph","Network Layout","Boundary Edges","Simulated Annealing"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3088343","title":"Conceptual Metaphor and Graphical Convention Influence the Interpretation of Line Graphs","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":103,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of English Language and Linguistics, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, U.K.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089228541","id":37089228541,"full_name":"Greg Woodin","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of English Language and Linguistics, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, U.K."]}},{"affiliation":"Department of English Language and Linguistics, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, U.K.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089227844","id":37089227844,"full_name":"Bodo Winter","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of English Language and Linguistics, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, U.K."]}},{"affiliation":"Spatial Perception, Applied Cognition & Education Lab, University of California Merced, Merced, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085907327","id":37085907327,"full_name":"Lace Padilla","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Spatial Perception, Applied Cognition & Education Lab, University of California Merced, Merced, CA, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Many metaphors in language reflect conceptual metaphors that structure thought. In line with metaphorical expressions such as ‘high number’, experiments show that people associate larger numbers with upward space. Consistent with this metaphor, high numbers are conventionally depicted in high positions on the $y$y-axis of line graphs. People also associate good and bad (emotional valence) with upward and downward locations, in line with metaphorical expressions such as ‘uplifting’ and ‘down in the dumps’. Graphs depicting good quantities (e.g., vacation days) are consistent with graphical convention and the valence metaphor, because ‘more’ of the good quantity is represented by higher $y$y-axis positions. In contrast, graphs depicting bad quantities (e.g., murders) are consistent with graphical convention, but not the valence metaphor, because more of the bad quantity is represented by higher (rather than lower) $y$y-axis positions. We conducted two experiments (N = 300 per experiment) where participants answered questions about line graphs depicting good and bad quantities. For some graphs, we inverted the conventional axis ordering of numbers. Line graphs that aligned (versus misaligned) with valence metaphors (up = good) were easier to interpret, but this beneficial effect did not outweigh the adverse effect of inverting the axis numbering. Line graphs depicting good (versus bad) quantities were easier to interpret, as were graphs that depicted quantity using the $x$x-axis (versus $y$y-axis). Our results suggest that conceptual metaphors matter for the interpretation of line graphs. However, designers of line graphs are warned against subverting graphical convention to align with conceptual metaphors.","article_number":"9451590","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9451590","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9451590/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9451590/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9666754,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 Feb. 2022","start_page":"1209","end_page":"1221","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":893,"insert_date":"20210610","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Linguistics","Cognitive science","Visualization","Psychology","Market research","Random sequences"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Conceptual metaphor theory","more is up","mental number line","cognition","linguistics","emotional valence","line graph","axis reversal","handedness","empirical evaluation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Line Graph","Graphical Interpretation","Graphic Conventions","Good And Bad","Good And Evil","Number Of Orders","Emotional Valence","Hedonic Tone","Positive Axis","Metaphorical Language","Metaphorical Expressions","Vacation Days","Holiday Days","Large Quantities","Larger Amount","Amount Of Information","Data Visualization","Cultural Practices","Horizontal Axis","Credible Interval","Handedness","Preregistered","Axis Parallel","Axial Orientation","Axis-aligned","Axis Of The Graph","Axis Of Each Graph","Positive Valence","Numerical Quantities","Numerous Amounts","Negative Valence","Situation In Cities","Side Of Space","Mental Models","Representative Time","Effect Of Valence","Effect Of Alignment"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2914446","title":"Real-Time Exploration of Large Spatiotemporal Datasets Based on Order Statistics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"11","issn":"2160-9306","rank":104,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Instituto de Informática, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085898354","id":37085898354,"full_name":"Cícero A.

While powerful, these approaches overlook the important fact that aggregations used to produce datacubes do not represent the actual distribution of the data being analyzed. As a result, these methods might produce biased results as well as hide important features in the data. In this paper, we introduce the Quantile Datacube Structure (QDS) that bridges this gap by supporting interactive visual exploration based on order statistics. To achieve this, QDS makes use of an efficient non-parametric distribution approximation scheme called p-digest and employs a novel datacube indexing scheme that reduces the memory usage of previous datacube methods. This enables interactive slicing and dicing while accurately approximating the distribution of quantitative variables of interest. We present two case studies that illustrate the ability of QDS to not only build order statistics based visualizations interactively but also to perform event detection on very large datasets. Finally, we present extensive experimental results that validate the effectiveness of QDS regarding memory usage and accuracy in the approximation of order statistics for real-world datasets.","article_number":"8706590","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8706590","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8706590/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8706590/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9210268,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"1 Nov. 2020","start_page":"3314","end_page":"3326","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":643,"insert_date":"20190506","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Data visualization","Delays","Airports","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Real-time systems","Data structures"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data structures for visualization","order statistics","quantile sketch","visual analytics","event detection"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Large Datasets","Large Data Sets","Order Statistics","Exploration Of Datasets","Exploration Of Data Sets","Exploration Of Large Datasets","Exploration Of Large Data Sets","Large Spatio-temporal Datasets","Large Spatio-temporal Data Sets","Event Detection","Memory Usage","Interactive Visualization","Interactive Exploration","Visual Exploration","Data Cube","Datacube","Indexing Scheme","Indexing Strategy","Boxplots","Centroid","Airport","Temporal Dimension","Time Dimension","Temporal Properties","Random Fields","First Quartile","Upper Quartile","Lower Quartile","Spatial Dimensions","Spatial Attributes","Third Quartile","Compression Parameters","Delay Distribution","Reduce Memory Usage","Median Curves","New York City","Dimensions Of Categories","Categories For Each Dimension","Quantile Estimation","Balanced Tree","Balanced Binary Tree","Quadtree","Analysis Of Large Datasets","Analysis Of Large Data Sets"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2895642","title":"Taxonomizer: Interactive Construction of Fully Labeled Hierarchical Groupings from Attributes of Multivariate Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"9","issn":"2160-9306","rank":105,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Visual Analytics and Imaging Laboratory, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085900805","id":37085900805,"full_name":"Salman Mahmood","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Visual Analytics and Imaging Laboratory, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, USA","SUNY Korea, Incheon, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Visual Analytics and Imaging Laboratory, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273119700","id":37273119700,"full_name":"Klaus Mueller","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Visual Analytics and Imaging Laboratory, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, USA","SUNY Korea, Incheon, South Korea"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Organizing multivariate data spaces by their dimensions or attributes can be a rather difficult task. Most of the work in this area focuses on the statistical aspects such as correlation clustering, dimension reduction, and the like. These methods typically produce hierarchies in which the leaf nodes are labeled by the attribute names while the inner nodes are often represented by just a statistical measure and criterion, such as a threshold. This makes them difficult to understand for mainstream users. Taxonomies in science, biology, engineering, etc. on the other hand, are easy to comprehend since they provide meaningful labels at the inner nodes as well. Labeling inner nodes of taxonomies automatically requires the identification of hypernyms. Our proposed framework, called Taxonomizer, takes a visual analytics approach to meet this challenge. It appeals to the wisdom of humans to liaise with state of the art data analytics, neural word embeddings, and lexical databases. It consists of a set of visual tools that starts out with an automatically computed hierarchy where the leaf nodes are the original data attributes, and it then allows users to sculpt high-quality taxonomies for any multivariate dataset.","article_number":"8634001","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8634001","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8634001/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8634001/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9152193,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"1 Sept. 2020","start_page":"2875","end_page":"2890","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":466,"insert_date":"20190204","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Taxonomy","Semantics","Tools","Task analysis","Aerospace electronics","Correlation","Labeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["High-dimensional data","data fusion and integration","hierarchy data","taxonomy","neural embeddings","lexical databases"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Hierarchical Groups","Dimensionality Reduction","Visualization Tool","Data Space","Word Embedding","Word Vectors","Leaf Node","Correlation Clustering","Inner Nodes","Interior Nodes","Lexical Database","Hypernym","Hyperonym","Hypernymy","Hierarchical Structure","Hierarchical Organization","Distance Matrix","Distance Matrices","Word Meaning","Tree Structure","Tree-structured","Similar Contexts","Subtree","Large Corpus","Large Corpora","Ranking Results","Context Words","Named Entity Recognition","Entity Extraction","Named-entity Recognition","Semantic Space","Properties Of The Dataset","Attributes In The Dataset","Cophenetic Correlation","Cophenetic Correlation Coefficient","Semantic Distance","Node Labels","Semantic Consistency","WordNet","Binary Structure","Human-in-the-loop","Human In The Loop","Node Heights"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2915222","title":"Fourier Opacity Optimization for Scalable Exploration","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"11","issn":"2160-9306","rank":106,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics Laboratory, ETH Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086993394","id":37086993394,"full_name":"Irene Baeza Rojo","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics Laboratory, ETH Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics Laboratory, ETH Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275694700","id":37275694700,"full_name":"Markus Gross","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics Laboratory, ETH Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland","director of Disney Research Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics Laboratory, ETH Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085416142","id":37085416142,"full_name":"Tobias Günther","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics Laboratory, ETH Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Over the past decades, scientific visualization became a fundamental aspect of modern scientific data analysis. Across all data-intensive research fields, ranging from structural biology to cosmology, data sizes increase rapidly. Dealing with the growing large-scale data is one of the top research challenges of this century. For the visual exploratory data analysis, interactivity, a view-dependent visibility optimization and frame coherence are indispensable. In this work, we extend the recent decoupled opacity optimization framework to enable a navigation without occlusion of important features through large geometric data. By expressing the accumulation of importance and optical depth in Fourier basis, the computation, evaluation and rendering of optimized transparent geometry become not only order-independent, but also operate within a fixed memory bound. We study the quality of our Fourier approximation in terms of accuracy, memory requirements and efficiency for both the opacity computation, as well as the order-independent compositing. We apply the method to different point, line and surface data sets originating from various research fields, including meteorology, health science, astrophysics and organic chemistry.","article_number":"8713907","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8713907","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8713907/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8713907/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9210268,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"1 Nov. 2020","start_page":"3204","end_page":"3216","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":612,"insert_date":"20190514","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Optimization","Geometry","Data visualization","Navigation","Cameras","Visualization","Rendering (computer graphics)"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Scientific visualization","opacity optimization","Fourier approximation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Scalable","Cosmological","Optical Depth","Optical Thickness","Geometric Data","Fourier Basis","Scientific Visualization","Discretion","Frequency Band","Time Complexity","Line Segment","Fourier Series","Fourier Decomposition","Fourier Modes","Fourier Expansion","Correct Order","Reference Solution","Fourier Coefficients","Fast Estimation","Fast Approximation","Filling Rate","Surface Patches","Coarse Estimation","Coarse Approximation","Linearizable","Atomic Actions","Atomic Operations","Memory Pool","Geometric Primitives","Graphical Primitives","Changes In Transparency","Global Optimization Problem","Stream Surface","Scene Geometry","Occlusion Problem","Selection Algorithm","Field Lines","Flux Lines","Information Theory","Information-theoretic","Information Theoretic"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3086414","title":"HisVA: A Visual Analytics System for Studying History","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":107,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089702261","id":37089702261,"full_name":"Dongyun Han","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"UNIST, Ulsan, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089576059","id":37089576059,"full_name":"Gorakh Parsad","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UNIST, Ulsan, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"UNIST, Ulsan, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089573739","id":37089573739,"full_name":"Hwiyeon Kim","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UNIST, Ulsan, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"UNIST, Ulsan, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089576696","id":37089576696,"full_name":"Jaekyom Shim","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UNIST, Ulsan, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"UNIST, Ulsan, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086519103","id":37086519103,"full_name":"Oh-Sang Kwon","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UNIST, Ulsan, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"UNIST, Ulsan, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089573495","id":37089573495,"full_name":"Kyung A.

MissBiN equips a novel method for link prediction in a bipartite network by leveraging the information of bi-cliques in the network.

The design of MissBiN is based on three high-level analysis questions (what, why, and how) regarding missing links, which are distilled from the literature and expert interviews. We conducted quantitative experiments to assess the performance of the proposed link prediction algorithm, and interviewed two experts from different domains to demonstrate the effectiveness of MissBiN as a whole.

This article presents a case study to investigate the possibility of characterizing the quality of insight via the interactions performed. To do this, we devised the interaction of a visualization tool-MediSyn-for insight generation. MediSyn supports five types of interactions: selecting, connecting, elaborating, exploring, and sharing. We evaluated MediSyn with 14 participants by allowing them to freely explore the data and generate insights. We then extracted seven interaction patterns from their interaction logs and correlated the patterns to four aspects of insight quality. The results show the possibility of qualifying insights via interactions. Among other findings, exploration actions can lead to unexpected insights; the drill-down pattern tends to increase the domain values of insights. A qualitative analysis shows that using domain knowledge to guide exploration can positively affect the domain value of derived insights.

Consequently, many methodologies and best practices for user studies have evolved. While maintaining interactivity continues to be crucial for the exploration of large data sets, no similar methodological foundation for evaluating runtime performance has been developed. Our analysis of 50 recent visualization papers on new or improved techniques for rendering volumes or particles indicates that only a very limited set of parameters like different data sets, camera paths, viewport sizes, and GPUs are investigated, which make comparison with other techniques or generalization to other parameter ranges at least questionable. To derive a deeper understanding of qualitative runtime behavior and quantitative parameter dependencies, we developed a framework for the most exhaustive performance evaluation of volume and particle visualization techniques that we are aware of, including millions of measurements on ten different GPUs. This paper reports on our insights from statistical analysis of this data, discussing independent and linear parameter behavior and non-obvious effects. We give recommendations for best practices when evaluating runtime performance of scientific visualization applications, which can serve as a starting point for more elaborate models of performance

exploratory data analysis. This becomes increasingly difficult in high dimensional datasets. While dimensionality reduction techniques can be utilized to reduce the analysis space, these may unintentionally bury key dimensions within a larger grouping and obfuscate meaningful patterns. With this work we introduce DimLift, a novel visual analysis method for creating and interacting with dimensional bundles. Generated through an iterative dimensionality reduction or user-driven approach, dimensional bundles are expressive groups of dimensions that contribute similarly to the variance of a dataset. Interactive exploration and reconstruction methods via a layered parallel coordinates plot allow users to lift interesting and subtle relationships to the surface, even in complex scenarios of missing and mixed data types. We exemplify the power of this technique in an expert case study on clinical cohort data alongside two additional case examples from nutrition and ecology.","article_number":"9349198","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9349198","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9349198/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9349198/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9429958,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 June 2021","start_page":"2908","end_page":"2922","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":889,"insert_date":"20210205","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Dimensionality reduction","Data visualization","Principal component analysis","Correlation","Tools","Neurology"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Dimensionality reduction","interactive visual analysis","visual analytics","parallel coordinates"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Exploratory Data","Interactive Exploration","Exploratory Analysis","Exploratory Data Analysis","Dimensionality Reduction","Visual Analysis","Interesting Patterns","Pattern Of Involvement","Interest In Relation","Clinical Cohort","Mixed Data","Group Dimension","Parallel Coordinates","Dimensional Space","Multidimensional Space","Cerebrovascular Disease","Cerebral Small Vessel Disease","Reduction Method","Reduction Methods","Nonlinear Method","Nonlinear Methods","Contribution Of Variants","Clinical Datasets","Clinical Data Sets","Lifestyle Variables","Diverse Lifestyles","Dimensionality Reduction Methods","Dimensionality Reduction Method","White Matter Volume","High-dimensional Data Analysis","High Dimensional Data Analysis","Original Dimensions","Visual Design","Multiple Correspondence Analysis","Cardiac Risk","Clinical Case Studies","Visual Approach","Mycorrhizal Plants","Interaction Techniques","Factor Analysis Of Data"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2963651","title":"Vis-a-Vis: Visual Exploration of Visualization Source Code Evolution","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"7","issn":"2160-9306","rank":112,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088875035","id":37088875035,"full_name":"Fabian Bolte","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37265895700","id":37265895700,"full_name":"Stefan Bruckner","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Developing an algorithm for a visualization prototype often involves the direct comparison of different development stages and design decisions, and even minor modifications may dramatically affect the results.

In this article, we present a novel approach that enables visualization programmers to simultaneously explore the evolution of their algorithm during the development phase together with its corresponding visual outcomes by providing an automatically updating meta visualization. Our interactive system allows for the direct comparison of all development states on both the visual and the source code level, by providing easy to use navigation and comparison tools. The on-the-fly construction of difference images, source code differences, and a visual representation of the source code structure further enhance the user's insight into the states' interconnected changes over time.

Techniques such as animated or juxtaposed tree visualizations are not capable of providing a good overview of the time series and lack expressiveness in conveying changes over time. Nested streamgraphs provide a better understanding of the data evolution, but lack the clear outline of hierarchical structures at a given timestep. Furthermore, these approaches are often limited to static hierarchies or exclude complex hierarchical changes in the data, limiting their use cases. We propose a novel visual metaphor capable of providing a static overview of all hierarchical changes over time, as well as clearly outlining the hierarchical structure at each individual time step. Our method allows for smooth transitions between treemaps and nested streamgraphs, enabling the exploration of the trade-off between dynamic behavior and hierarchical structure. As our technique handles topological changes of all types, it is suitable for a wide range of applications. We demonstrate the utility of our method on several use cases, evaluate it with a user study, and provide its full source code.","article_number":"8998355","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8998355","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8998355/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8998355/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9468994,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 Aug. 2021","start_page":"3571","end_page":"3584","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":558,"insert_date":"20200213","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Layout","Sociology","Statistics","Image color analysis","Encoding"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","hierarchy data","time-varying data","streamgraphs","treemaps"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Metaphors","Time Step","Hierarchical Structure","Hierarchical Organization","Changes In Data","Treemap","Tree Map","Functional Tree","Performance Of Trees","Root Node","Parent Node","Tree Nodes","Levels Of Hierarchy","Visualization Techniques","Value Of Node","Node Positions","Location Of Nodes","Leaf Node","Changes In Representation","Number Of Time Steps","Number Of Timesteps","Explicit Method","Explicit Solver","Explicit Methods","Additional Space","Current Time Step","Current Timestep","Certain Point In Time","Evolution Of Values","Node Depth","Node Depths","Visual Encoding","Mental Maps","Bezier Curve","Cubic Bézier","Bézier Curves","Visualization Of Changes","Implicit Method","Implicit Methods","Implicit Solver","Siblings","Continuous Stream","Renal Cortex","Kidney Cortex","Medical Terms","Medical Terminology"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865361","title":"SolarView: Low Distortion Radial Embedding with a Focus","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"10","issn":"2160-9306","rank":114,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"TU Eindhoven, Eindhoven, AZ, Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086960685","id":37086960685,"full_name":"Thom Castermans","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Eindhoven, Eindhoven, AZ, Netherlands"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Eindhoven, Eindhoven, AZ, Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591265900","id":37591265900,"full_name":"Kevin Verbeek","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Eindhoven, Eindhoven, AZ, Netherlands"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Eindhoven, Eindhoven, AZ, Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591266000","id":37591266000,"full_name":"Bettina Speckmann","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Eindhoven, Eindhoven, AZ, Netherlands"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Eindhoven, Eindhoven, AZ, Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282586000","id":37282586000,"full_name":"Michel A.

We present an interactive exploration tool SolarView which places the focus entity at the center of a “solar system” and embeds its neighbors guided by concentric circles. SolarView provides an implementation of our novel embedding and several state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction and embedding techniques, which we adapted to our setting in various ways. We experimentally evaluated our embedding and compared it to these state-of-the-art techniques. The results show that our embedding competes with these techniques and achieves low distortion in practice. Our method performs particularly well when the visualization, and hence the embedding, adheres to the solar system design principle of our application. Nonetheless-as with all dimensionality reduction techniques-the distortion may be high. We leverage interaction techniques to give clear visual cues that allow users to accurately judge distortion.

tasks such as citation analysis and social influence analysis. The main challenges include how to summarize large-scale, complex, and time-evolving influence graphs, and how to design effective visual metaphors and dynamic representation methods to illustrate influence patterns over time. In this work, we present Eiffel, an integrated visual analytics system that applies triple summarizations on evolutionary influence graphs in the nodal, relational, and temporal dimensions. In numerical experiments, Eiffel summarization results outperformed those of traditional clustering algorithms with respect to the influence-flow-based objective. Moreover, a flow map representation is proposed and adapted to the case of influence graph summarization, which supports two modes of evolutionary visualization (i.e., flip-book and movie) to expedite the analysis of influence graph dynamics. We conducted two controlled user experiments to evaluate our technique on influence graph summarization and visualization respectively. We also showcased the system in the evolutionary influence analysis of two typical scenarios, the citation influence of scientific papers and the social influence of emerging online events. The evaluation results demonstrate the value of Eiffel in the visual analysis of evolutionary influence graphs.","article_number":"8673661","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8673661","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8673661/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8673661/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9184388,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"1 Oct. 2020","start_page":"2944","end_page":"2960","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":851,"insert_date":"20190325","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Task analysis","Data visualization","Citation analysis","Layout","Twitter","Clutter"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Influence graph","dynamic visualization","citation analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visibility Graph","Flow Map","Visual System","Clustering Algorithm","Visual Analysis","Social Influence","Influence Of Development","Citation Analysis","Visual Metaphors","Twitter","Task Completion","Completion Time","Influencers","Supplementary Material Online","Nodes In The Graph","Leaf Node","Source Node","Visual Design","Original Graph","Large Graphs","Static Graph","Dynamic Graph","Citation Network","Bezier Curve","Map Design","Human–computer Interaction Research","Flow Graph","Task Completion Time","Visual Clutter","Time Frame"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2962404","title":"ProReveal: Progressive Visual Analytics With Safeguards","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"7","issn":"2160-9306","rank":116,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085589835","id":37085589835,"full_name":"Jaemin Jo","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088875147","id":37088875147,"full_name":"Sehi L’Yi","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37293389400","id":37293389400,"full_name":"Bongshin Lee","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37422552700","id":37422552700,"full_name":"Jinwook Seo","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"]}}]},"access_type":"CCBY - IEEE is not the copyright holder of this material.

Despite its potential benefits, intermediate knowledge from progressive analytics can be incorrect due to various machine and human factors, such as a sampling bias or misinterpretation of uncertainty. To alleviate this problem, we introduce PVA-Guards, safeguards people can leave on uncertain intermediate knowledge that needs to be verified, and derive seven PVA-Guards based on previous visualization task taxonomies. PVA-Guards provide a means of ensuring the correctness of the conclusion and understanding the reason when intermediate knowledge becomes invalid. We also present ProReveal, a proof-of-concept system designed and developed to integrate the seven safeguards into progressive data exploration. Finally, we report a user study with 14 participants, which shows people voluntarily employed PVA-Guards to safeguard their findings and ProReveal's PVA-Guard view provides an overview of uncertain intermediate knowledge. We believe our new concept can also offer better consistency in progressive data exploration, alleviating people's heterogeneous interpretation of uncertainty.","article_number":"8943144","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8943144","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8943144/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8943144/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9442784,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 July 2021","start_page":"3109","end_page":"3122","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1282,"insert_date":"20191225","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Uncertainty","Visual analytics","Human factors","Computational modeling","Bars","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Progressive visual analytics","intermediate knowledge representation","hypothesis testing","scalability","uncertainty"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Safeguard","Human Factor","User Study","Exploratory Data","Root Mean Square Error","Root-mean-square Deviation","Root-mean-square Error","RMSD","RMSE","Heatmap","Distribution Of Values","Valid Measure","Validity Of Measures","Power-law","Scaling Law","Power Law","Large-scale Data","Large Scale Data","Interactive System","Reasonable Time","Precise Results","Precision Of Results","Intermediate Results","Intermediate Outcomes","Bar Charts","Visual Elements","Aggregation Function","Boolean Variable","Boolean Value","Valid Knowledge","Validity Of Knowledge","Main View","Type Of Visualization","Apache Spark"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2734659","title":"An Analysis of Automated Visual Analysis Classification: Interactive Visualization Task Inference of Cancer Genomics Domain Experts","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"8","issn":"2160-9306","rank":117,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Brown University, Providence, RI","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38488457200","id":38488457200,"full_name":"Connor C.

Our evaluation uses common classifiers that are accessible to most visualization evaluators: k-nearest neighbors, linear support vector machines, and random forests. By comparing classifier predictions to visual analysis task inferences made by experts, we show that simple automated task classification can have up to 73 percent accuracy and can separate meaningful logs from “junk” logs with up to 91 percent accuracy. Our second contribution is an exploration of common MAGI interaction trends using classification predictions, which expands current knowledge about ecological cancer genomics visualization tasks. Our third contribution is a discussion of how automated task classification can inform iterative tool design. These contributions suggest that mouse interaction log analysis is a viable method for (1) evaluating task requirements of client-side-focused tools, (2) allowing researchers to study experts on larger scales than is typically possible with in-lab observation, and (3) highlighting potential tool evaluation bias.","article_number":"7999244","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7999244","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7999244/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7999244/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8400450,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"1 Aug. 2018","start_page":"2270","end_page":"2283","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":684,"insert_date":"20170801","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Mice","Tools","Cancer","Genomics","Bioinformatics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Classification","task analysis","visual analysis","biology visualization","visualization","cancer genomics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Cancer Genome","Visual Analysis","Visual Task","Domain Experts","Interactive Visualization","Visual Classification","Visual Categorization","Inference Task","Support Vector Machine","Random Forest","Design Tool","Ideal Tool","Classification Task","Categorization Task","Visualization Tool","Analysis Tasks","Task Requirements","Linear Support Vector Machine","Linear SVM","Iterative Design","Loop Design","Percent Accuracy","Random Sampling","Locus Of Control","Sense Of Control","Labeling Task","Nearest-neighbor Model","Nearest-neighbour Model","Qualitative Observations","Random Forest Classifier","User Goals","Classification Rate","Classification Evaluation","Pairs Of Participants","Random Forest Model","Evaluation Methodology","Visual Analytics Tool"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3023537","title":"Words of Estimative Correlation: Studying Verbalizations of Scatterplots","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"4","issn":"2160-9306","rank":118,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Centre for Translational Bioinformatics, Queen Mary, University of London, London, U.K.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085536876","id":37085536876,"full_name":"Rafael Henkin","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Centre for Translational Bioinformatics, Queen Mary, University of London, London, U.K."]}},{"affiliation":"Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies, University of Warwick, Coventry, U.K.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37567685600","id":37567685600,"full_name":"Cagatay Turkay","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies, University of Warwick, Coventry, U.K."]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Natural language and visualization are being increasingly deployed together for supporting data analysis in different ways, from multimodal interaction to enriched data summaries and insights.

We describe two studies aimed at identifying characteristics of data and charts that are relevant in such tasks. The first study asks participants to verbalize what they see in scatterplots that depict various levels of correlations. The second study then asks participants to choose visualizations that match a given verbal description of correlation. We extract key concepts from responses, organize them in a taxonomy and analyze the categorized responses. We observe that participants use a wide range of vocabulary across all scatterplots, but particular concepts are preferred for higher levels of correlation. A comparison between the studies reveals the ambiguity of some of the concepts. We discuss how the results could inform the design of multimodal representations aligned with the data and analytical tasks, and present a research roadmap to deepen the understanding about visualizations and natural language.","article_number":"9195155","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9195155","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9195155/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9195155/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9721431,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 April 2022","start_page":"1967","end_page":"1981","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":415,"insert_date":"20200911","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Correlation","Task analysis","Data analysis","Taxonomy","Natural language processing"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Information visualization","natural language generation","natural language processing","human-computer interaction"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Characteristics Of Data","Features Of Data","Natural Language","High Level Of Correlation","Multimodal Interaction","Multimodal Interface","Negation","Data Visualization","Utterances","Properties Of Data","Data Attributes","Beampattern","Far-field Pattern","Field Pattern","Negative Mood","Adverbs","Tight Relationship","Natural Language Processing Techniques","Multimodal System","Negative Statements","Online Repository","Semi-automated Approach","Text Generation","Sentence Generation","Natural Language Generation","Syntactic Analysis","Syntactic Parsing","Distribution Of Answers","Correlation Scatter Plots","Correlation Scatterplots","Hellinger Distance","Visual Representation Of Data","Semantic Groups","Type Of Visualization","Clear Relationship","Conceptual Combination","Postage","Part-of-speech Tagging","Postal Mail","Part Of Speech Tagging","Analysis Of Responses","Visual Representation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.2968911","title":"Visualization of 3D Stress Tensor Fields Using Superquadric Glyphs on Displacement Streamlines","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"7","issn":"2160-9306","rank":119,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088875723","id":37088875723,"full_name":"Mohak Patel","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275712600","id":37275712600,"full_name":"David H.

We also developed a testing framework and performed user studies to evaluate the various glyph-based tensor visualizations for objective accuracy measures, and subjective user feedback for each visualization method. To represent the stress tensor, we color encoded the original superquadric glyph, and in the user study, we compared it to superquadric glyphs developed for second-order symmetric tensors. We found that color encoding improved the user accuracy measures, while the users also rated our method the highest. We compared our method of placing stress tensor glyphs on displacement streamlines to the glyph placement on a 3D grid. In the visualization, we modified the glyph to show both the stress tensor and the displacement vector at each sample point.

Being embedded within an archaeological project, we realized how assessing such qualitative uncertainty is crucial in gaining a holistic and accurate understanding of regional spatio-temporal patterns of human settlements over millennia. We therefore investigated the impact of visualizing qualitative implicit errors on the sense-making process via a probe that deliberately represented three distinct implicit errors, i.e., differing collection methods, subjectivity of data interpretations and assumptions on temporal continuity. By analyzing the interactions of 14 archaeologists with different levels of domain expertise, we discovered that novices became more actively aware of typically overlooked data issues and domain experts became more confident of the visualization itself. We observed how participants quoted social factors to alleviate some uncertainty, while in order to minimize it they requested additional contextual breadth or depth of the data. While our visualization did not alleviate all uncertainty, we recognized how it sparked reflective meta-insights regarding methodological directions of the data. We believe our findings inform future visualizations on how to handle the complexity of implicit errors for a range of user typologies and for highly data-critical application domains such as the

treating data dimensions as first-class objects that can be explored in tandem with data values. In this article, we extend the Dual Analysis framework through the joint treatment of quantitative (numerical) and qualitative (categorical) dimensions. Computing common measures for all dimensions allows us to visualize both quantitative and qualitative dimensions in the same view. This enables a natural joint treatment of mixed data during interactive visual exploration and analysis. Several measures of variation for nominal qualitative data can also be applied to ordinal qualitative and quantitative data. For example, instead of measuring variability from a mean or median, other measures assess inter-data variation or average variation from a mode. In this work, we demonstrate how these measures can be integrated into the Dual Analysis framework to explore and generate hypotheses about high-dimensional mixed data. A medical case study using clinical routine data of patients suffering from Cerebral Small Vessel Disease (CSVD), conducted with a senior neurologist and a medical student, shows that a joint Dual Analysis approach for quantitative and qualitative data can rapidly lead to new insights based on which new hypotheses may be generated.","article_number":"9346003","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9346003","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9346003/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9346003/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9429958,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 June 2021","start_page":"2953","end_page":"2966","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1044,"insert_date":"20210203","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Correlation","Visualization","Data visualization","Tools","Standards","Neurology","Cultural differences"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Dual analysis approach","high-dimensional data","mixed data","mixed statistical analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Quantitative Data","Quantitative Method","Quantitative Assessment","Quantitative Research","Quantitative Studies","Quantitative Approach","Quantitative Methods","Qualitative Analysis","Qualitative Data Analysis","Qualitative Data","Variety Of Measures","Cerebrovascular Disease","Cerebral Small Vessel Disease","Visual Analysis","Dimensional Data","Interactive Visualization","Mixed Data","Dual Approach","Nominal Data","Qualitative Properties","Qualitative Attributes","Qualitative Dimensions","Quantitative Properties","Quantitative Dimensions","Quantitative Attributes","Routine Clinical Data","Quantitative Measures","Dimensional Space","Multidimensional Space","Real-world Data","Statistical Measures","Central Tendency","Statistical Changes","Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy","Parallel Coordinates","Subset Selection","Hypothesis Generation","Medical Experts","Descriptive Measures","Visual Approach","Qualitative Measures","Radar Plot"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3006995","title":"A Discrete Probabilistic Approach to Dense Flow Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":122,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"COVIDAG, the University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089002862","id":37089002862,"full_name":"Daniel Preuß","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["COVIDAG, the University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282635100","id":37282635100,"full_name":"Tino Weinkauf","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"]}},{"affiliation":"COVIDAG, the University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37548560500","id":37548560500,"full_name":"Jens Krüger","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["COVIDAG, the University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Dense flow visualization is a popular visualization paradigm. Traditionally, the various models and methods in this area use a continuous formulation, resting upon the solid foundation of functional analysis. In this work, we examine a discrete formulation of dense flow visualization. From probability theory, we derive a similarity matrix that measures the similarity between different points in the flow domain, leading to the discovery of a whole new class of visualization models. Using this matrix, we propose a novel visualization approach consisting of the computation of spectral embeddings, i.e., characteristic domain maps, defined by particle mixture probabilities. These embeddings are scalar fields that give insight into the mixing processes of the flow on different scales. The approach of spectral embeddings is already well studied in image segmentation, and we see that spectral embeddings are connected to Fourier expansions and frequencies. We showcase the utility of our method using different 2D and 3D flows.","article_number":"9139395","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9139395","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9139395/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9139395/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9586408,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 Dec. 2021","start_page":"4347","end_page":"4358","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":422,"insert_date":"20200713","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Complexity theory","Technological innovation","Organizations","Collaboration","Bibliographies","Decision making","Industrial engineering"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Flow visualization","volume visualization","spectral methods"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Flow Visualization","Image Segmentation","Probability Theory","Area Method","Area Methods","Flow Domain","3D Flow","Probabilistic Mixture","Discretion","Eigenvalues","Streamline","Probabilistic Model","Input Image","Feature Maps","Conditional Probability","Vector Field","Efficient Implementation","Particle Position","Position Of Each Particle","Output Image","Probability Matrix","Probability Matrices","Laplacian Matrix","Laplacian Matrices","Kernel Length","Interpolation Scheme","Interpolation Strategy","Probability Of Particles","Particle Trajectories","Number Of Nonzero Entries","Probabilistic Framework","Spectral Graph Theory","Graph Spectrum","Kernel Function","Matrix-vector Product","Transfer Function"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2873011","title":"Topic-Based Exploration and Embedded Visualizations for Research Idea Generation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"2160-9306","rank":123,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Brown University, Providence, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489241200","id":38489241200,"full_name":"Hua Guo","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Brown University, Providence, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Brown University, Providence, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275712600","id":37275712600,"full_name":"David H.

Within this field, parallel merge tree construction has seen abundant recent contributions, with a trend of decentralized, task-parallel or SMP-oriented algorithms dominating in terms of total runtime. However, none of these recent approaches computed complete merge trees on distributed systems, leaving this field to traditional divide & conquer approaches. This article introduces a scalable, parallel and distributed algorithm for merge tree construction outperforming the previously fastest distributed solution by a factor of around three. This is achieved by a task-parallel identification of individual merge tree arcs by growing regions around critical points in the data, without any need for ordered progression or global data structures, based on a novel insight introducing a sufficient local boundary for region growth.","article_number":"9420248","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9420248","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9420248/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9420248/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9468994,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 Aug. 2021","start_page":"3585","end_page":"3596","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":753,"insert_date":"20210430","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Vegetation","Task analysis","Data visualization","Distributed databases","Runtime","Data structures","Market research"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Scientific visualization","topological data analysis","task parallelism","distributed architecture"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Merging Algorithm","Scalable","Data Structure","Critical Point","Distribution System","Global Structure","Construction Algorithm","Distributed Algorithm","Global Structure Of Data","Small Values","Local Minima","Parallelization","Reachable","Tree Nodes","Construction Sequencing","Sequential Algorithm","Communication Overhead","Ad Hoc Networks","Depth-first","Joining Tree","Sublevel Set","Inner Nodes","Shared Memory","Data Chunks","Quotient Space","Union Operation","Merging Step","Family Of Algorithms","Master Node","Computing Nodes"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2916098","title":"Embedding Meta Information into Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"11","issn":"2160-9306","rank":126,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086324336","id":37086324336,"full_name":"Alok Hota","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37281262900","id":37281262900,"full_name":"Jian Huang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this work, we study how to co-locate meta information with visualizations by directly embedding information into visualizations.

While numerous academic papers investigated how to make the scheduling process of meetings faster or even automatic, little work has been done yet to facilitate the retrospective reasoning about how time is spent on meetings. Traditional calendar applications do not allow users to extract actionable statistics although it has been shown that reflection-oriented design can increase the users' understanding of their habits and can thereby encourage a shift towards better practices. In this paper, we present MineTime Insight, a tool made of multiple coordinated views for the exploration of personal calendar data, with the overarching goal of improving short and long-term scheduling decisions. Despite being focused on the working environment, our work builds upon recent results in the field of Personal Visual Analytics, as it targets users not necessarily expert in visualization and data analysis. We demonstrate the potential of MineTime Insight, when applied to the agenda of an executive manager. Finally, we discuss the results of an informal user study and a field study.

From the data analysis point of view, it can be observed that many ensemble visualization works focus on the same facet of ensemble data, use similar data aggregation or uncertainty modeling methods. However, the lack of reflections on those essential commonalities and a systematic overview of those works prevents visualization researchers from effectively identifying new or unsolved problems and planning for further developments. In this paper, we take a holistic perspective and provide a survey of ensemble visualization. Specifically, we study ensemble visualization works in the recent decade, and categorize them from two perspectives: (1) their proposed visualization techniques; and (2) their involved analytic tasks. For the first perspective, we focus on elaborating how conventional visualization techniques (e.g., surface, volume visualization techniques) have been adapted to ensemble data; for the second perspective, we emphasize how analytic tasks (e.g., comparison, clustering) have been performed differently for ensemble data. From the study of ensemble visualization literature, we have also identified several research trends, as well as some future research opportunities.","article_number":"8405549","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8405549","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8405549/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8405549/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8781959,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"1 Sept. 2019","start_page":"2853","end_page":"2872","citing_paper_count":86,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":3069,"insert_date":"20180706","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Computational modeling","Data models","Task analysis","Uncertainty","Biological system modeling","Visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Ensemble data","visualization and visual analysis","literature analysis","taxonomy"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Ensemble Data","Analysis Tasks","Visualization Techniques","Time Step","Computer Simulations","Probability Density Function","Grid Points","Vector Field","Viscous Fluid","Point Flow","Viscous Liquid","Simulated Field","Collective Values","Scalar Value","Ensemble Members","Group Technique","Extra Dimension","Extra-dimensional","Ensemble Technique","Ensemble Simulations","Time Series Plots","Time-series Plots","Pathlines","Temporal Trend Analysis","General Pipeline","Volume Rendering","Volumetric Rendering","Volume-rendering","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Collection Of Vectors","Parametric Data","Ensemble Clustering","Number Of Time Steps","Number Of Timesteps","Position Uncertainty","Localization Uncertainty","Type Of Work"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.2986996","title":"t-viSNE: Interactive Assessment and Interpretation of t-SNE Projections","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"8","issn":"2160-9306","rank":129,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Media Technology, Linnaeus University, Växjö, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086529537","id":37086529537,"full_name":"Angelos Chatzimparmpas","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Media Technology, Linnaeus University, Växjö, Sweden"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Media Technology, Linnaeus University, Växjö, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086180105","id":37086180105,"full_name":"Rafael M.

Understanding the details of t-SNE itself and the reasons behind specific patterns in its output may be a daunting task, especially for non-experts in dimensionality reduction. In this article, we present t-viSNE, an interactive tool for the visual exploration of t-SNE projections that enables analysts to inspect different aspects of their accuracy and meaning, such as the effects of hyper-parameters, distance and neighborhood preservation, densities and costs of specific neighborhoods, and the correlations between dimensions and visual patterns. We propose a coherent, accessible, and well-integrated collection of different views for the visualization of t-SNE projections. The applicability and usability of t-viSNE are demonstrated through hypothetical usage scenarios with real data sets. Finally, we present the results of a user study where the tool's effectiveness was evaluated.

It leverages the higher-order singular-value decomposition (HOSVD), a generalization of the SVD to three dimensions and higher, together with bit-plane, run-length and arithmetic coding to compress the HOSVD transform coefficients. Our scheme degrades the data particularly smoothly and achieves lower mean squared error than other state-of-the-art algorithms at low-to-medium bit rates, as it is required in data archiving and management for visualization purposes. Further advantages of the proposed algorithm include very fine bit rate selection granularity and the ability to manipulate data at very small cost in the compression domain, for example to reconstruct filtered and/or subsampled versions of all (or selected parts) of the data set.","article_number":"8663447","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8663447","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8663447/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8663447/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9152193,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"1 Sept. 2020","start_page":"2891","end_page":"2903","citing_paper_count":72,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1328,"insert_date":"20190308","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Matrix decomposition","Transforms","Encoding","Data visualization","Compression algorithms","Three-dimensional displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Transform-based compression","scientific visualization","higher-order singular value decomposition","Tucker model","tensor decompositions"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Multidimensional Data","Multidimensional Analysis","Tensor Compression","Bitplane","Bitrate","Network Bandwidth","Data Bandwidth","Modulation Bandwidth","Internet Bandwidth","Small Cost","Compression Algorithm","Compression Scheme","Compression Strategy","Arithmetic Coding","Arithmetic Encoder","Least-squares","Least Squares Method","High Ratio","Matrix Factorization","Matrix Decomposition","Factor Matrices","Binary Matrix","Binary Matrices","Compressor","Error Tolerance","Compression Ratio","Compression Rate","Most Significant Bit","High Bit","Highest Bit","Tensor Decomposition","Mode Fiber","Tucker Decomposition","Volume Rendering","Volumetric Rendering","Volume-rendering","Dimensional Tensor","High Compression Ratio","Separate Filters","Quantization Bits","Entropy Coding","Entropy Encoding","Lossless Compression","Lossless Data Compression","Double-precision Floating-point","64-bit Floating-point","Double Float","Double-precision Floating","Float64","Double Precision Floating","Root Mean Square Error","Root-mean-square Deviation","Root-mean-square Error","RMSD","RMSE"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2922597","title":"A Visual Analytics System for Exploring, Monitoring, and Forecasting Road Traffic Congestion","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"11","issn":"2160-9306","rank":131,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"UNIST","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088517517","id":37088517517,"full_name":"Chunggi Lee","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UNIST"]}},{"affiliation":"UNIST","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088516799","id":37088516799,"full_name":"Yeonjun Kim","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UNIST"]}},{"affiliation":"UNIST","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088514723","id":37088514723,"full_name":"Seungmin Jin","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UNIST"]}},{"affiliation":"UNIST","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088516487","id":37088516487,"full_name":"Dongmin Kim","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UNIST"]}},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396008400","id":37396008400,"full_name":"Ross Maciejewski","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282598900","id":37282598900,"full_name":"David Ebert","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University"]}},{"affiliation":"UNIST","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088878128","id":37088878128,"full_name":"Sungahn Ko","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UNIST"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present an interactive visual analytics system that enables traffic congestion exploration, surveillance, and forecasting based on vehicle detector data.

Our approach integrates an ensemble OoD detection method and a grid-based visualization.

To better analyze and understand the OoD samples in context, we have developed a novel kNN-based grid layout algorithm motivated by Hall's theorem.

However, no work can solve the problem for both lines and surfaces. In this paper, we present FlowNet, a single deep learning framework for clustering and selection of streamlines and stream surfaces. Given a collection of streamlines or stream surfaces generated from a flow field data set, our approach converts them into binary volumes and then employs an autoencoder to learn their respective latent feature descriptors. These descriptors are used to reconstruct binary volumes for error estimation and network training. Once converged, the feature descriptors can well represent flow lines or surfaces in the latent space. We perform dimensionality reduction of these feature descriptors and cluster the projection results accordingly. This leads to a visual interface for exploring the collection of flow lines or surfaces via clustering, filtering, and selection of representatives. Intuitive user interactions are provided for visual reasoning of the collection with ease. We validate and explain our deep learning framework from multiple perspectives, demonstrate the effectiveness of FlowNet using several flow field data sets of different characteristics, and compare our approach against state-of-the-art streamline and stream surface selection algorithms.","article_number":"8532319","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8532319","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8532319/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8532319/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9016330,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"1 April 2020","start_page":"1732","end_page":"1744","citing_paper_count":38,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1841,"insert_date":"20181111","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three-dimensional displays","Surface reconstruction","Feature extraction","Data visualization","Analytical models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Flow visualization","streamlines","stream surfaces","deep learning","autoencoder","feature descriptor","clustering","selection"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Deep Learning","Stream Surface","FlowNet","Dimensionality Reduction","Descriptive Characteristics","Feature Descriptors","Network Training","Autoencoder","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Flow Field","Latent Space","Embedding Space","Latent Features","Latent Characteristics","Line Balancing","Flow Lines","Flow Visualization","Visual Interface","Different Sets Of Features","Different Sets Of Characteristics","Collector Surface","Training Set","Convolutional Neural Network","Convolutional Layers","F1 Score","F-measure","Number Of Streamlines","Flow Dataset","Flow Data Sets","Flow Patterns","Clustering Results","Peak Signal-to-noise Ratio","Peak Signal To Noise Ratio","PSNR","Agglomerative Clustering","Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Latent Dirichlet Allocation","Binary Cross Entropy","Clustering Approach"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2859997","title":"Graph Drawing by Stochastic Gradient Descent","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"9","issn":"2160-9306","rank":135,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086930296","id":37086930296,"full_name":"Jonathan X.

For achieving this objective, we propose an approach that includes a combination of query techniques for flexible selection of episodes of situation development, a method for dynamic aggregation of data from selected groups of episodes, and a data structure for representing the aggregates that enables their exploration and use in further analysis. The aggregation, which is meant to abstract general movement patterns, involves construction of new time-homomorphic reference systems owing to iterative application of aggregation operators to a sequence of data selections. As similar patterns may occur at different spatial locations, we also propose constructing new spatial reference systems for aligning and matching movements irrespective of their absolute locations. The approach was tested in application to tracking data from two Bundesliga games of the 2018/2019 season. It enabled detection of interesting and meaningful general patterns of team behaviors in three classes of situations defined by football experts. The experts found the approach and the underlying concepts worth implementing in tools for football analysts.","article_number":"8894420","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8894420","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8894420/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8894420/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9363708,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 April 2021","start_page":"2280","end_page":"2297","citing_paper_count":37,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2072,"insert_date":"20191108","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Sports","Games","Aggregates","Data mining","Data visualization","Trajectory","Companies"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","movement data","coordinated movement","sport analytics","football","soccer"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Time And Space","Spacetime","Tactical Analysis","Data Structure","General Pattern","Interesting Patterns","Pattern Of Involvement","Tracking Data","Aggregation Method","Aggregation Operators","Episodic Selection","Time Interval","Event Data","Effective Data","Visual Analysis","Trajectory Analysis","Collective Behavior","Collective Behaviour","Position Data","Time Stamp","Relative Movement","Space Transformation","Team Players","Ball Possession","Player Movement","Player Position","Set Intervals","Set Time Intervals","Game Situations","Game Events","Idea Of Space","Ideas Of Space","Team Formation","Median Position","Visual Display"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2917689","title":"The Curse of Knowledge in Visual Data Communication","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"10","issn":"2160-9306","rank":137,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Northwestern University, Evanston, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102197","id":37087102197,"full_name":"Cindy Xiong","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University, Evanston, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088490183","id":37088490183,"full_name":"Lisanne Van Weelden","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands"]}},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University, Evanston, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077249100","id":37077249100,"full_name":"Steven Franconeri","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University, Evanston, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"A viewer can extract many potential patterns from any set of visualized data values. But that means that two people can see different patterns in the same visualization, potentially leading to miscommunication. Here, we show that when people are primed to see one pattern in the data as visually salient, they believe that naïve viewers will experience the same visual salience. Participants were told one of multiple backstories about political events that affected public polling data, before viewing a graph that depicted those data. One pattern in the data was particularly visually salient to them given the backstory that they heard. They then predicted what naïve viewers would most visually salient on the visualization. They were strongly influenced by their own knowledge, despite explicit instructions to ignore it, predicting that others would find the same patterns to be most visually salient. This result reflects a psychological phenomenon known as the curse of knowledge, where an expert struggles to re-create the state of mind of a novice. The present findings show that the curse of knowledge also plagues the visual perception of data, explaining why people can fail to connect with audiences when they communicate patterns in data.","article_number":"8718533","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8718533","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8718533/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8718533/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9184388,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"1 Oct. 2020","start_page":"3051","end_page":"3062","citing_paper_count":37,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2231,"insert_date":"20190520","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Psychology","Decision making","Data communication","Data mining","Cognition"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Cognitive biases","data communication","expertise","information visualization","perception and cognition"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Visualization","Knowledge Of Problems","Curse Of Knowledge","Audience","Patterns In Data","Polling Data","Signed-rank Test","Wilcoxon Signed-rank Test","Signed Rank Test","Wilcoxon Test","Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test","Public Opinion","Public Perception","Bar Graphs","Background Knowledge","Educational Issues","Pedagogical Issues","Sarcasm","Sarcastic","Conservative Party","Feature Ranking","Liberal Party","Progressive Party","Top Features","Types Of Graphs","Immigration Issues","Version Of The Story","Purple Bars","Experiment 1a","Experiment 1b","Background Story","Salient Patterns","Set Of Stories","Tappers","Initial Argument","Initial Debate","Election","Critical Features","Critical Characteristics","Critical Quality","Line Graph","Cognitive Biases","Cognitive Bias"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2851227","title":"COPE: Interactive Exploration of Co-Occurrence Patterns in Spatial Time Series","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"8","issn":"2160-9306","rank":138,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Computer Software, Tianjin University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085431300","id":37085431300,"full_name":"Jie Li","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Software, Tianjin University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer Institute IAIS, Rhein-Sieg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085387892","id":37085387892,"full_name":"Siming Chen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute IAIS, Rhein-Sieg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Texas, Dallas, TX, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37277192000","id":37277192000,"full_name":"Kang Zhang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Texas, Dallas, TX, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"City University, London, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047100","id":37283047100,"full_name":"Gennady Andrienko","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["City University, London, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"City University, London, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047700","id":37283047700,"full_name":"Natalia Andrienko","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["City University, London, UK"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Spatial time series is a common type of data dealt with in many domains, such as economic statistics and environmental science.

We focus on a further step in event analysis: discover temporal relationship patterns between event locations, i.e., repeated cases when there is a specific temporal relationship (same time, before, or after) between events occurring at two locations. This can provide important clues for understanding the formation and spreading mechanisms of events and interdependencies among spatial locations. We propose a visual exploration framework COPE (Co-Occurrence Pattern Exploration), which allows users to extract events of interest from data and detect various co-occurrence patterns among them.

One approach for disease progression modeling is to describe patient status using a small number of states that represent distinctive distributions over a set of observed measures. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) and its variants are a class of models that both discover these states and make inferences of health states for patients. Despite the advantages of using the algorithms for discovering interesting patterns, it still remains challenging for medical experts to interpret model outputs, understand complex modeling parameters, and clinically make sense of the patterns. To tackle these problems, we conducted a design study with clinical scientists, statisticians, and visualization experts, with the goal to investigate disease progression pathways of chronic diseases, namely type 1 diabetes (T1D), Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). As a result, we introduce DPVis which seamlessly integrates model parameters and outcomes of HMMs into interpretable and interactive visualizations. In this article, we demonstrate that DPVis is successful in evaluating disease progression models, visually summarizing disease states, interactively exploring disease progression patterns, and building, analyzing, and comparing clinically relevant patient subgroups.","article_number":"9058722","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9058722","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9058722/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9058722/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9501051,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 Sept. 2021","start_page":"3685","end_page":"3700","citing_paper_count":31,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1180,"insert_date":"20200407","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Hidden Markov models","Diseases","Analytical models","Diabetes","Data visualization","Task analysis","Data models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Disease progression","hidden markov model","state space model","diabetes","huntington's","parkinson's","interpretability"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Disease Progression","Visual Analysis","Hidden Markov Model","Clinical Research","Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus","Huntington’s Disease","Interactive Visualization","Progression Patterns","Relevant Subgroups","Disease Progression In Models","Observational Studies","Population-based Study","Longitudinal Study","Longitudinal Data","Longitudinal Research","Longitudinal Design","Observational Data","Transition State","Sequence Of Events","Kernel Density","State Characteristics","State Features","Observable Variables","Feature Matrix","Feature Matrices","Hidden State","Insulin Autoantibodies","Islet Cell Antibodies","Islet Cell Autoantibodies","Trajectory Groups","Sequence Of States","Usage Scenarios","Sankey Diagram","Sankey Plot","Series Of Workshops","Transition Patterns","Speed Of Progression","Clinical Domain","Subjective Views"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3004137","title":"Tilt Map: Interactive Transitions Between Choropleth Map, Prism Map and Bar Chart in Immersive Environments","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":140,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085820538","id":37085820538,"full_name":"Yalong Yang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Human-Centred Computing, Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37326161000","id":37326161000,"full_name":"Tim Dwyer","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Human-Centred Computing, Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Human-Centred Computing, Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37354163600","id":37354163600,"full_name":"Kim Marriott","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Human-Centred Computing, Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Human-Centred Computing, Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38488917300","id":38488917300,"full_name":"Bernhard Jenny","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Human-Centred Computing, Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Human-Centred Computing, Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077419200","id":37077419200,"full_name":"Sarah Goodwin","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Human-Centred Computing, Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We introduce Tilt Map, a novel interaction technique for intuitively transitioning between 2D and 3D map visualisations in immersive environments.

However, existing one-size-fits-all hierarchical clustering methods often fail to meet the diverse needs of different users. To address this challenge, we present an interactive steering method to visually supervise constrained hierarchical clustering by utilizing both public knowledge (e.g., Wikipedia) and private knowledge from users. The novelty of our approach includes 1) automatically constructing constraints for hierarchical clustering using knowledge (knowledge-driven) and intrinsic data distribution (data-driven), and 2) enabling the interactive steering of clustering through a visual interface (user-driven). Our method first maps each data item to the most relevant items in a knowledge base. An initial constraint tree is then extracted using the ant colony optimization algorithm. The algorithm balances the tree width and depth and covers the data items with high confidence. Given the constraint tree, the data items are hierarchically clustered using evolutionary Bayesian rose tree. To clearly convey the hierarchical clustering results, an uncertainty-aware tree visualization has been developed to enable users to quickly locate the most uncertain sub-hierarchies and interactively improve them. The quantitative evaluation and case study demonstrate that the proposed approach facilitates the building of customized clustering trees in an efficient and effective manner.","article_number":"9094378","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9094378","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9094378/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9094378/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9526678,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 Oct. 2021","start_page":"3953","end_page":"3967","citing_paper_count":28,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1583,"insert_date":"20200515","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Clustering algorithms","Visualization","Data visualization","Buildings","Clustering methods","Bayes methods","Measurement"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Hierarchical clustering","constrained clustering","exploratory data analysis","tree visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Hierarchical Clustering","Hierarchical Cluster Analysis","Interactive Steering","Knowledge Base","Knowledge-based","Clustering Method","Clustering Methods","Clustering Results","Ant Colony","Ant Nests","Public Knowledge","Clustering Tree","Tree Depth","Hierarchical Clustering Method","Hierarchical Clustering Methods","Ant Colony Optimization","Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm","Ant Colony Algorithm","Ant System","Hierarchical Clustering Results","Machine Learning","Machine-learning","Information System","Data System","Clustering Algorithm","Visual Analysis","Unsupervised Clustering","Pheromone","Information Retrieval","DBpedia","High Degree Of Uncertainty","World Wide Web","Beam Search","Social Media Data","Social Media Analytics","Different Sources Of Information","Leaf Node","Parent Child Relationship","Parent-child Relationship","Relevant Nodes","Data-driven Methods","Data-driven Method"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2882449","title":"Semantics-Space-Time Cube: A Conceptual Framework for Systematic Analysis of Texts in Space and Time","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"4","issn":"2160-9306","rank":143,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085431300","id":37085431300,"full_name":"Jie Li","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer Institute IAIS, Sankt Augustin, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085387892","id":37085387892,"full_name":"Siming Chen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute IAIS, Sankt Augustin, Germany","University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of Cad&CG, ZheJiang University, Hangzhou, P.

To represent the semantics, we apply probabilistic topic modeling. After extracting a set of topics and representing the texts by vectors of topic weights, we aggregate the data into a data cube with the dimensions corresponding to the set of topics, the set of spatial locations (e.g., regions), and the time divided into suitable intervals according to the scale of the planned analysis. Each cube cell corresponds to a combination (topic, location, time interval) and contains aggregate measures characterizing the subset of the texts concerning this topic and having the spatial and temporal references within these location and interval. Based on this structure, we systematically describe the space of analysis tasks on exploring the interrelationships among the three heterogeneous information facets, semantics, space, and time. We introduce the operations of projecting and slicing the cube, which are used to decompose complex tasks into simpler subtasks. We then present a design of a visual analytics system intended to support these subtasks. To reduce the complexity of the user interface, we apply the principles of structural, visual, and operational uniformity while respecting the specific properties of each facet. The aggregated data are represented in three parallel views corresponding to the three facets and providing different complementary perspectives on the data. The views have similar look-and-feel to the extent allowed by the facet specifics. Uniform interactive operations applicable to any view support establishing links between the facets. The uniformity principle is also applied in supporting the projecting and slicing operations on the data cube. We evaluate the feasibility and utility of the approach by applying it in two analysis scenarios using geolocated social media data for studying people's reactions to social and natural events of different spatial and temporal scales.","article_number":"8540796","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8540796","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8540796/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8540796/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9016330,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"1 April 2020","start_page":"1789","end_page":"1806","citing_paper_count":27,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1364,"insert_date":"20181120","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Task analysis","Semantics","Visualization","Time measurement","Data visualization","Complexity theory","Aggregates"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Spatiotemporal visualization","semantic visualization","data cube","interactive exploration","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Time And Space","Spacetime","Time Interval","Social Media","Social Platforms","Social Consequences","Social Events","Social Effects","Visual Analysis","Georeferenced","Spatial Reference","Local Setting","Analysis Tasks","Over Space","Hyperspace","Topic Modeling","Uniform Structure","Social Media Data","Social Media Analytics","Data Cube","Datacube","Temporal Reference","Suitable Interval","Suitable Time Interval","Topical","Types Of Tasks","Cloud Data","Word Cloud","Word Clouds","Distribution Measurements","Latent Dirichlet Allocation","Latent Dirichlet Allocation Model","Interactive Exploration","Visual Interface","Visual Design","Exploration Of The Relationship","Topic Distribution","Distribution Of Subjects","Subjective Views","Visualization Techniques","Uniform Way"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2802945","title":"Shadow Accrual Maps: Efficient Accumulation of City-Scale Shadows Over Time","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"2160-9306","rank":144,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"New York University, New York, NY","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085886059","id":37085886059,"full_name":"Fabio Miranda","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University, New York, NY"]}},{"affiliation":"New York University, New York, NY","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38228713200","id":38228713200,"full_name":"Harish Doraiswamy","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University, New York, NY"]}},{"affiliation":"Universidade Federal Fluminense, Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37721747800","id":37721747800,"full_name":"Marcos Lage","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universidade Federal Fluminense, Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"]}},{"affiliation":"Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates PC, New York, NY","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085896574","id":37085896574,"full_name":"Luc Wilson","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates PC, New York, NY"]}},{"affiliation":"Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates PC, New York, NY","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085890990","id":37085890990,"full_name":"Mondrian Hsieh","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates PC, New York, NY"]}},{"affiliation":"New York University, New York, NY","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275249200","id":37275249200,"full_name":"Cláudio T.

They can be both beneficial, such as for pedestrians during summer, and detrimental, by impacting vegetation and by blocking direct sunlight. Determining the effects of shadows requires the accumulation of shadows over time across different periods in a year. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient class of approach that uses the properties of sun movement to track the changing position of shadows within a fixed time interval. We use this approach to extend two commonly used shadow techniques, shadow maps and ray tracing, and demonstrate the efficiency of our approach. Our technique is used to develop an interactive visual analysis system, Shadow Profiler, targeted at city planners and architects that allows them to test the impact of shadows for different development scenarios.

The comparison measure satisfies metric properties, it can be computed efficiently, and the cost model for the edit operations is both intuitive and captures well-known properties of merge trees.

The design of SSR-TVD includes a generator and two discriminators (spatial and temporal discriminators). The generator takes a low-resolution volume as input and outputs a synthesized high-resolution volume. To capture spatial and temporal coherence in the volume sequence, the two discriminators take the synthesized high-resolution volume(s) as input and produce a score indicating the realness of the volume(s). Our method can work in the in situ visualization setting by downscaling volumetric data from selected time steps as the simulation runs and upscaling downsampled volumes to their original resolution during postprocessing. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SSR-TVD, we show quantitative and qualitative results with several time-varying data sets of different characteristics and compare our method against volume upscaling using bicubic interpolation and a solution solely based on CNN.","article_number":"9229162","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9229162","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9229162/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9229162/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9766250,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 June 2022","start_page":"2445","end_page":"2456","citing_paper_count":24,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":848,"insert_date":"20201019","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Coherence","Deep learning","Generative adversarial networks","Training","Gallium nitride"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Time-varying data visualization","deep learning","super-resolution","generative adversarial network"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Time-varying Data","Spatial Super-resolution","Deep Learning","Time Step","Quantitative Results","Quantitative Outcomes","Generative Adversarial Networks","Adversarial Learning","Downscaling","Volumetric Data","Temporal Coherence","Bicubic Interpolation","Different Sets Of Features","Different Sets Of Characteristics","High-resolution Volume","Scientific Visualization","Transfer Function","Spatial Dimensions","Spatial Attributes","Bottom Layer","Vector Field","Visual Quality","Residual Block","Peak Signal-to-noise Ratio","Peak Signal To Noise Ratio","PSNR","Conv Layer","Peak Signal-to-noise Ratio Values","Mean Opinion Score","Real Volume","Isosurface","Skip Connections","Optical Flow","Red Part","Temporal Discrimination","Loss Of Content"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2855742","title":"Measuring and Modeling the Feature Detection Threshold Functions of Colormaps","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"9","issn":"2160-9306","rank":147,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37265850800","id":37265850800,"full_name":"Colin Ware","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086219721","id":37086219721,"full_name":"Terece L.

To apply pseudocoloring to a scalar field, the field value at each point is represented using one of a sequence of colors (called a colormap). One of the principles applied in generating colormaps is uniformity and previously the main method for determining uniformity has been the application of uniform color spaces. In this paper we present a new method for evaluating the feature detection threshold function across a colormap. The method is used in crowdsourced studies for the direct evaluation of nine colormaps for three feature sizes. The results are used to test the hypothesis that a uniform color space (CIELAB) will accurately model colormapped feature detection thresholds compared to a model where the chromaticity components have reduced weights. The hypothesis that feature detection can be predicted solely on the basis of luminance is also tested. The results reject both hypotheses and we demonstrate how reduced weights on the green-red and blue-yellow terms of the CIELAB color space creates a more accurate model when the task is the detection of smaller features in colormapped data. Both the method itself and modified CIELAB can be used in colormap design and evaluation.","article_number":"8413174","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8413174","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8413174/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8413174/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8781959,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"1 Sept. 2019","start_page":"2777","end_page":"2790","citing_paper_count":24,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2163,"insert_date":"20180719","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image color analysis","Task analysis","Feature extraction","Sensitivity","Sea measurements","Frequency measurement","Spatial resolution"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Colormapping","color perception"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Feature Detection","Color Map","Colour Map","Colormap","Characteristics Of Data","Features Of Data","Feature Size","Size Characteristics","Crowdsourcing","Color Space","Colour Space","Color Components","Uniform Color","Uniform Colour","Uniform Spacing","Scientific Visualization","Best Fit","Curve Fitting","Grayscale","Greyscale","Gray Level","Discriminatory Power","Mechanical Turk","Colorblind","Color Blindness","Colour-blind","Color Vision Deficiency","Color Channels","Colour Channels","Contrast Sensitivity","Test Pattern","Test Card","Increase In Threshold","High Discriminatory Power","Low Discriminatory Power","Just Noticeable Difference","Just-noticeable-difference","Low Spatial Frequency","Low-spatial Frequency","Contrast Threshold","Pixel Data","Data For Each Pixel","Fewer Steps","Equal Steps","Stimulus Images","Image Stimuli","Pattern Perception","Sinusoidal Pattern"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2808969","title":"Smart Brushing for Parallel Coordinates","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"2160-9306","rank":148,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Swansea University, Swansea, Wales","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086608502","id":37086608502,"full_name":"Richard C.

Although much work has been done on both adversarial attack and defense, a fine-grained understanding of adversarial examples is still lacking. To address this issue, we present a visual analysis method to explain why adversarial examples are misclassified. The key is to compare and analyze the datapaths of both the adversarial and normal examples. A datapath is a group of critical neurons along with their connections. We formulate the datapath extraction as a subset selection problem and solve it by constructing and training a neural network. A multi-level visualization consisting of a network-level visualization of data flows, a layer-level visualization of feature maps, and a neuron-level visualization of learned features, has been designed to help investigate how datapaths of adversarial and normal examples diverge and merge in the prediction process. A quantitative evaluation and a case study were conducted to demonstrate the promise of our method to explain the misclassification of adversarial examples.","article_number":"8967166","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8967166","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8967166/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8967166/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9442784,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 July 2021","start_page":"3289","end_page":"3304","citing_paper_count":20,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1923,"insert_date":"20200123","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Neurons","Visualization","Data visualization","Feature extraction","Training","Merging","Biological neural networks"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Robustness","deep neural networks","adversarial examples","explainable machine learning"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Neural Network","Deep Network","Deep Neural Network","Robustness Of Deep Neural Networks","Feature Maps","Visual Analysis","Feature Learning","Flow Data","Predictive Processing","Incorrect Predictions","Adversarial Attacks","Datapath","Data Path","Adversarial Examples","Deep Learning","Convolutional Neural Network","Neuronal Activity","Recurrent Neural Network","Neurons In Layer","Deep Convolutional Neural Network","Visualization Tool","Normal Images","Merging Point","Contribution Of Neurons","Activation Maps","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Visual Analytics Tool","Deep Generative Models","Obvious Example","Role Of Neurons","Target Image"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3084694","title":"Interactive Graph Construction for Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"9","issn":"2160-9306","rank":150,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086544275","id":37086544275,"full_name":"Changjian Chen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088924788","id":37088924788,"full_name":"Zhaowei Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Cardiff University, Cardiff, U.K.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086225533","id":37086225533,"full_name":"Jing Wu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Cardiff University, Cardiff, U.K."]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085460249","id":37085460249,"full_name":"Xiting Wang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086615631","id":37086615631,"full_name":"Lan-Zhe Guo","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086211111","id":37086211111,"full_name":"Yu-Feng Li","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406039100","id":37406039100,"full_name":"Shixia Liu","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Semi-supervised learning (SSL) provides a way to improve the performance of prediction models (e.g., classifier) via the usage of unlabeled samples.

In this paper, we present a visual analysis method that interactively constructs a high-quality graph for better model performance. In particular, we propose an interactive graph construction method based on the large margin principle. We have developed a river visualization and a hybrid visualization that combines a scatterplot, a node-link diagram, and a bar chart to convey the label propagation of graph-based SSL. Based on the understanding of the propagation, a user can select regions of interest to inspect and modify the graph. We conducted two case studies to showcase how our method facilitates the exploitation of labeled and unlabeled samples for improving model performance.","article_number":"9444198","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9444198","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9444198/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9444198/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9501051,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 Sept. 2021","start_page":"3701","end_page":"3716","citing_paper_count":20,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2140,"insert_date":"20210528","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Dogs","Visualization","Image edge detection","Noise measurement","Labeling","Data visualization","Uncertainty"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Semi-supervised learning","unlabeled samples","graph quality"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Semi-supervised Learning","Graph Construction","Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning","Model Performance","Bar Charts","Label Propagation","Global Level","Sampling Region","High Uncertainty","Nodes In The Graph","Line Segment","Graph Structure","Labeled Samples","Deep Neural Network Model","Voronoi Diagram","Voronoi Tessellation","Voronoi Cell","Propagation Path","Local Module","Sampling Problem","Diabetic Macular Edema","Diabetic Macular Oedema","Wrong Predictions","Individual Edges","Components Of The Graph","Visual Analytics Tool","Interactive Exploration","Affect Model Performance","Samples Of Different Classes","Distributed Edge","Interactive Visualization","Local Level"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2810068","title":"An Exploratory Framework for Cyclone Identification and Tracking","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"2160-9306","rank":151,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Automation, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086608562","id":37086608562,"full_name":"Akash Anil Valsangkar","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Automation, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Meteorology, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086613469","id":37086613469,"full_name":"Joy Merwin Monteiro","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Meteorology, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085461262","id":37085461262,"full_name":"Vidya Narayanan","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Science and Technology, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282721800","id":37282721800,"full_name":"Ingrid Hotz","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Science and Technology, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Automation, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37278509300","id":37278509300,"full_name":"Vijay Natarajan","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Automation, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Analyzing depressions plays an important role in meteorology, especially in the study of cyclones. In particular, the study of the temporal evolution of cyclones requires a robust depression tracking framework. To cope with this demand we propose a pipeline for the exploration of cyclones and their temporal evolution. This entails a generic framework for their identification and tracking. The fact that depressions and cyclones are not well-defined objects and their shape and size characteristics change over time makes this task especially challenging. Our method combines the robustness of topological approaches and the detailed tracking information from optical flow analysis. At first cyclones are identified within each time step based on well-established topological concepts. Then candidate tracks are computed from an optical flow field. These tracks are clustered within a moving time window to distill dominant coherent cyclone movements, which are then forwarded to a final tracking step. In contrast to previous methods our method requires only a few intuitive parameters. An integration into an exploratory framework helps in the study of cyclone movement by identifying smooth, representative tracks. Multiple case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in tracking cyclones, both in the northern and southern hemisphere.","article_number":"8303701","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8303701","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8303701/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8303701/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8629338,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"1 March 2019","start_page":"1460","end_page":"1473","citing_paper_count":20,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":652,"insert_date":"20180227","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Cyclones","Tracking","Meteorology","Object tracking","Image sequences","Storms"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Cyclone","scalar field","time-varying data","track graph","spatio-temporal clustering","tracking"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Explanatory Framework","Cyclone Tracks","Time Step","Time Window","Northern Hemisphere","Southern Hemisphere","Optical Flow","Final Tracking","Atmospheric Pressure","Sea Level Pressure","Air Pressure","Barometric Pressure","Window Length","Window Lengths","Subtree","Tracking Algorithm","Number Of Time Steps","Number Of Timesteps","Single Tracking","Clustering Threshold","Individual Tracks","Feature Tracking","Feature-tracking","Joining Tree","Junction Tree","Tree-decomposition","Tree Decomposition","Number Of Tracks","Multiple Tracking","Zooniverse","Snapshot Serengeti","Cyclone Centre","Ancient Life","Mean Sea Level Pressure","Mean Sea-level Pressure","Short Track","ERA-Interim Dataset","ERA-Interim Data Set","Symmetric Difference","Consecutive Time Steps","Consecutive Timesteps","Latitude Longitude Grid","Latitude-longitude Grid","Longitude-latitude Grid","Cyclone Activity","Dimensional Space","Multidimensional Space","Temporal Noise"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2802520","title":"Exploration Strategies for Discovery of Interactivity in Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":152,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085671312","id":37085671312,"full_name":"Tanja Blascheck","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Alexandra Institute, Aarhus N, Denmark","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086570002","id":37086570002,"full_name":"Lindsay MacDonald Vermeulen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Alexandra Institute, Aarhus N, Denmark"]}},{"affiliation":"Aarhus University, Aarhus N, Denmark","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38012864900","id":38012864900,"full_name":"Jo Vermeulen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Aarhus University, Aarhus N, Denmark"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077505300","id":37077505300,"full_name":"Charles Perin","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945380800","id":37945380800,"full_name":"Wesley Willett","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268023800","id":37268023800,"full_name":"Thomas Ertl","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37285000100","id":37285000100,"full_name":"Sheelagh Carpendale","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We investigate how people discover the functionality of an interactive visualization that was designed for the general public.

Developing a better understanding of this discovery process can help inform the design of visualizations for the general public, which in turn can help make data more accessible. To unpack this problem, we conducted a lab study in which participants were free to use their own methods to discover the functionality of a connected set of interactive visualizations of public energy data. We collected eye movement data and interaction logs as well as video and audio recordings. By analyzing this combined data, we extract exploration strategies that the participants employed to discover the functionality in these interactive visualizations.

This is undesirable since measurements of physical properties should ideally not depend on the way the (virtual) measurement device moves. There are some properties that are invariant under certain types of reference frame transformations: Galilean invariance (invariance under equal-speed translation) and objectivity (invariance under any smooth rotation and translation of the reference frame). In this paper, we introduce even harder conditions than objectivity: we demand invariance under any smooth similarity transformation (rotation, translation and uniform scale) as well as invariance under any smooth affine transformation of the reference frame. We show that these new hyper-objective measures allow the extraction of vortices that change their volume or deform. Further, we present a generic approach that transforms almost any vortex measure into a hyper-objective one. We apply our methods to vortex extraction in 2D and 3D vector fields, and analyze the numerical robustness, extraction time and the minimization residuals for the Galilean invariant, objective, and the two new hyper-objective approaches.","article_number":"8454764","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8454764","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8454764/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8454764/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8974568,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"1 March 2020","start_page":"1532","end_page":"1547","citing_paper_count":19,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":350,"insert_date":"20180905","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Tensile stress","Two dimensional displays","Three-dimensional displays","Feature extraction","Sea measurements","Strain","Transforms"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Flow visualization","vortex extraction","objectivity","affine invariance"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Reference Frame","Extraction Time","Vector Field","Affine Transformation","Type Of Transformation","Similarity Transformation","Uniform Scale","2D Vector","Degrees Of Freedom","Regular Grid","Cartesian Grid","Grid Structure","Rectangular Grid","Objective Methods","Objective Method","Steady Flow","Unsteady Flow","Local Neighborhood","Local Neighbourhood","Local Neighbourhoods","Local Neighborhoods","Neighborhood Size","Neighbourhood Size","Temporal Derivative","Local Frame","Circular Pattern","Optimal Reference","Technical Objects","Vortex Core","Optimal Frame","Region-based Methods","Region-based Method","Registration-based Method","Registration-based Methods","Local Reference Frame","Local Reference System","Local Inertial Frame","Invariant Method","Invariant Methods","Global Reference Frame","Pathlines","Strain Rate Tensor","Strain-rate Tensor","Ambient Flow","Numerical Data","Numerous Data","Field Eq","Field Eqs"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2889081","title":"Multimodal Analysis of Video Collections: Visual Exploration of Presentation Techniques in TED Talks","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"7","issn":"2160-9306","rank":154,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086808853","id":37086808853,"full_name":"Aoyu Wu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"While much research in the educational field has revealed many presentation techniques, they often overlap and are even occasionally contradictory.

We consider the problem of analyzing a large collection of behaviors by multiple actors, more specifically, identifying typical behaviors and spotting anomalous behaviors. We propose an approach leveraging topic modeling techniques - LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) Ensembles - to represent categories of typical behaviors by topics that are obtained through topic modeling a behavior collection. When such methods are applied to text in natural languages, the quality of the extracted topics are usually judged based on the semantic relatedness of the terms pertinent to the topics. This criterion, however, is not necessarily applicable to topics extracted from non-textual data, such as action sets, since relationships between actions may not be obvious. We have developed a suite of visual and interactive techniques supporting the construction of an appropriate combination of topics based on other criteria, such as distinctiveness and coverage of the behavior set. Two case studies on analyzing operation behaviors in the security management system and visiting behaviors in an amusement park, and the expert evaluation of the first case study demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","article_number":"8663312","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8663312","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8663312/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8663312/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9152193,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"1 Sept. 2020","start_page":"2775","end_page":"2792","citing_paper_count":19,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":923,"insert_date":"20190308","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Analytical models","Semantics","Visual analytics","Tools","Clustering algorithms","Data mining"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["LDA","visual analytics","user behavior"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Behavioral Categories","Behavioural Categories","Latent Dirichlet Allocation","Interactive Exploration","Semantic","Typical Behavior","Type Of Behaviour","Topic Modeling","Visualization Techniques","Subjects In Group","Behavioral Model","Visual Analysis","Domain Experts","Subject Selection","Topic Selection","Interactive Visualization","Action Classes","Action Categories","Non-negative Matrix Factorization","Actual Probability","Combination Of Words","Subset Of Subjects","Projective Space","Representation Of Behavior","Representation Of Behaviour","Chord Diagram","Projection Views","Anomaly Score","Mixture Of Topics","Atypical Behavior","Atypical Behaviour","Rationale For The Choice","Exploration Of Themes","Exploration Of These Themes","Exploration Of Topics","Flow Map","Pie Chart","Behavioral Analysis","Behavioural Analysis"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2961674","title":"The Making of Continuous Colormaps","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":157,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Institute of Computer Science, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656928","id":37088656928,"full_name":"Pascal Nardini","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37280982800","id":37280982800,"full_name":"Min Chen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"]}},{"affiliation":"Center for Agile Technology, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085461049","id":37085461049,"full_name":"Francesca Samsel","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Center for Agile Technology, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Data Science at Scale Team, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085421815","id":37085421815,"full_name":"Roxana Bujack","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Data Science at Scale Team, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"German Climate Computing Center (DKRZ), Hamburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869987100","id":37869987100,"full_name":"Michael Böttinger","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["German Climate Computing Center (DKRZ), Hamburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Computer Science, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282574800","id":37282574800,"full_name":"Gerik Scheuermann","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Continuous colormaps are integral parts of many visualization techniques, such as heat-maps, surface plots, and flow visualization. Despite that the critiques of rainbow colormaps have been around and well-acknowledged for three decades, rainbow colormaps are still widely used today. One reason behind the resilience of rainbow colormaps is the lack of tools for users to create a continuous colormap that encodes semantics specific to the application concerned. In this paper, we present a web-based software system, CCC-Tool (short for Charting Continuous Colormaps) under the URL https://ccctool.com, for creating, editing, and analyzing such application-specific colormaps. We introduce the notion of “colormap specification (CMS)” that maintains the essential semantics required for defining a color mapping scheme. We provide users with a set of advanced utilities for constructing CMS's with various levels of complexity, examining their quality attributes using different plots, and exporting them to external application software. We present two case studies, demonstrating that the CCC-Tool can help domain scientists as well as visualization experts in designing semantically-rich colormaps.","article_number":"8939459","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8939459","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8939459/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8939459/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9429958,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 June 2021","start_page":"3048","end_page":"3063","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":811,"insert_date":"20191223","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image color analysis","Data visualization","Tools","Semantics","Guidelines","Standards","Software systems"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["CCC-Tool","charting continuous colormaps","colormap specification","perceptual uniformity","colormap analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Web-based System","Discriminatory Power","Hurricane","Tropical Cyclones","Wide Band","Linear Interpolation","Sea Surface Temperature","Color Difference","Colour Difference","Color Space","Colour Space","Color Components","Strong Gradient","Multiple Bands","Number Of Spaces","Color Bands","Colour Bands","Discontinuity Point","Discontinuous Points","Color Transition","Colour Transition","RGB Space","Bands In Order","Discontinuous Transition","Strong Temperature Gradients","Upwelling System","HSV Color","HSV Color Space","Hue, Saturation, Value","Hue-saturation-value","Discretion","Single Color","Single Colour","Formation Water","Molecular Chemistry","Design Guidelines","Contrast Type","Sea Surface","Color Wheel","Colour Wheel"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3076749","title":"Visual Analytics for RNN-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":158,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Visa Research, Palo Alto, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085897852","id":37085897852,"full_name":"Junpeng Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visa Research, Palo Alto, CA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Visa Research, Palo Alto, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086828301","id":37086828301,"full_name":"Wei Zhang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visa Research, Palo Alto, CA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Visa Research, Palo Alto, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086368522","id":37086368522,"full_name":"Hao Yang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visa Research, Palo Alto, CA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Visa Research, Palo Alto, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086107560","id":37086107560,"full_name":"Chin-Chia Michael Yeh","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visa Research, Palo Alto, CA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Visa Research, Palo Alto, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088810641","id":37088810641,"full_name":"Liang Wang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visa Research, Palo Alto, CA, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) targets to train an autonomous agent to interact with a pre-defined environment and strives to achieve specific goals through deep neural networks (DNN). Recurrent neural network (RNN) based DRL has demonstrated superior performance, as RNNs can effectively capture the temporal evolution of the environment and respond with proper agent actions. However, apart from the outstanding performance, little is known about how RNNs understand the environment internally and what has been memorized over time. Revealing these details is extremely important for deep learning experts to understand and improve DRLs, which in contrast, is also challenging due to the complicated data transformations inside these models. In this article, we propose Deep Reinforcement Learning Interactive Visual Explorer (DRLIVE), a visual analytics system to effectively explore, interpret, and diagnose RNN-based DRLs. Having focused on DRL agents trained for different Atari games, DRLIVE accomplishes three tasks: game episode exploration, RNN hidden/cell state examination, and interactive model perturbation. Using the system, one can flexibly explore a DRL agent through interactive visualizations, discover interpretable RNN cells by prioritizing RNN hidden/cell states with a set of metrics, and further diagnose the DRL model by interactively perturbing its inputs. Through concrete studies with multiple deep learning experts, we validated the efficacy of DRLIVE.","article_number":"9420254","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9420254","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9420254/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9420254/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9930678,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 Dec. 2022","start_page":"4141","end_page":"4155","citing_paper_count":14,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1727,"insert_date":"20210430","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Games","Visual analytics","Analytical models","Reinforcement learning","Recurrent neural networks","Perturbation methods","Data models","Deep learning"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Deep reinforcement learning (DRL)","recurrent neural network (RNN)","model interpretation","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Deep Reinforcement Learning","Deep Learning","Deep Neural Network","Recurrent Neural Network","Interactive Visualization","Proper Activity","Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent","Deep Reinforcement Learning Model","Cell State","Status Of Cells","Cells In Conditions","Convolutional Neural Network","Critical Step","Single Step","Long Short-term Memory","Long Short Term Memory","LSTM","Statistical Properties","Internal State","Internal Conditions","Sequential Steps","Text Data","Text Corpus","Domain Experts","Selection Step","Hidden State","RNN-based Models","Saliency Map","Projection Views","Recurrent Neural Network Model","Gated Recurrent Unit","t-SNE Projection","Game Conditions","Game State","Failure Cases","Smooth Changes"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3023013","title":"Showing Data About People: A Design Space of Anthropographics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"2160-9306","rank":159,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Universidade Federal de Campina Grande, Campina Grande, Brazil","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089274613","id":37089274613,"full_name":"Luiz Morais","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universidade Federal de Campina Grande, Campina Grande, Brazil","Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LRI, Orsay, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Sorbonne Université, CNRS, ISIR, Paris, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37076983200","id":37076983200,"full_name":"Yvonne Jansen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sorbonne Université, CNRS, ISIR, Paris, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Universidade Federal de Campina Grande, Campina Grande, Brazil","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37276504900","id":37276504900,"full_name":"Nazareno Andrade","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universidade Federal de Campina Grande, Campina Grande, Brazil"]}},{"affiliation":"CNRS, Inria, LRI, Université Paris-Saclay, Orsay, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590932700","id":37590932700,"full_name":"Pierre Dragicevic","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["CNRS, Inria, LRI, Université Paris-Saclay, Orsay, France"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"When showing data about people, visualization designers and data journalists often use design strategies that presumably help the audience relate to those people. The term anthropographics has been recently coined to refer to this practice and the resulting visualizations. Anthropographics is a rich and growing area, but the work so far has remained scattered. Despite preliminary empirical work and a few web essays written by practitioners, there is a lack of clear language for thinking about and communicating about anthropographics. We address this gap by introducing a conceptual framework and a design space for anthropographics. Our design space consists of seven elementary design dimensions that can be reasonably hypothesized to have some effect on prosocial feelings or behavior. It extends a previous design space and is informed by an analysis of 105 visualizations collected from newspapers, websites, and research articles. We use our conceptual framework and design space to discuss trade-offs, common design strategies, as well as future opportunities for design and research in the area of anthropographics.","article_number":"9189859","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9189859","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9189859/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9189859/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9695945,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 March 2022","start_page":"1661","end_page":"1679","citing_paper_count":14,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1037,"insert_date":"20200909","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Tools","Psychology","Urban areas","Indexes"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Anthropographics","design space","empathy","compassion","prosocial behavior"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Design Space","Conceptual Framework","Design Strategies","Design Scheme","Research Opportunities","Design Properties","Design Attributes","Design Dimensions","Data Journalism","Diary Data","Data-driven Journalism","Visual Design","Design Opportunities","High Specificity","Empathy","Empathic","Empathetic","Group Of People","Personal Information","Low Specificity","Reference Population","Design Choices","Vision Research","Minimum Coverage","Anthropomorphic","Single Person","Group Of Persons","Physicalism","Use Of Metaphors","Statistical Charts","Dynamic Visualization","Real Person","Interactive Visualization","Use Of Symbols","Symbolic Manipulation","High Granularity","Actual Person","Physical Body","Physical Objects","Physical Form","Physical Entities"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3006426","title":"Probabilistic Data-Driven Sampling via Multi-Criteria Importance Analysis","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":160,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077194500","id":37077194500,"full_name":"Ayan Biswas","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077202300","id":37077202300,"full_name":"Soumya Dutta","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085799683","id":37085799683,"full_name":"Earl Lawrence","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37570501800","id":37570501800,"full_name":"John Patchett","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38485584400","id":38485584400,"full_name":"Jon C.

However, I/O capabilities lag by orders of magnitude, which means only a fraction of the simulation data can be stored for post hoc analysis. Prespecified plans for saving features and quantities of interest do not work for features that have not been seen before. Data-driven intelligent sampling schemes are needed to detect and save important parts of the simulation while it is running. Here, we propose a novel sampling scheme that reduces the size of the data by orders-of-magnitude while still preserving important regions.

In this article, we study a big mobile location dataset that covers millions of city residents, but is temporally sparse on the trajectory of individual user. Mapping sparse trajectories to illustrate population movement poses several challenges from both analysis and visualization perspectives. In the literature, there are a few techniques designed for sparse trajectory visualization; yet they do not consider trajectories collected from mobile apps that possess long-tailed sparsity with record intervals as long as hours. This article introduces UrbanMotion, a visual analytics system that extends the original wind map design by supporting map-matched local movements, multi-directional population flows, and population distributions. Effective methods are proposed to extract and aggregate population movements from dense parts of the trajectories leveraging their long-tailed sparsity. Both characteristic and anomalous patterns are discovered and visualized. We conducted three case studies, one comparative experiment, and collected expert feedback in the application domains of commuting analysis, event detection, and business site configuration. The study result demonstrates the significance and effectiveness of our system in helping to complete key analytics tasks for urban users.","article_number":"9086086","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9086086","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9086086/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9086086/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9526678,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 Oct. 2021","start_page":"3881","end_page":"3899","citing_paper_count":13,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1405,"insert_date":"20200504","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Trajectory","Data visualization","Urban areas","Sociology","Statistics","Visualization","Spatiotemporal phenomena"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Movement visualization","sparse trajectory","wind map"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Trajectory Analysis","Sparse Trajectories","Mobile App","Sparsity","Original Design","Event Detection","Human Movement","Population Movement","Local Movement","Modern City","User Tasks","Anomalous Patterns","Map Design","Site Configuration","City Movement","Movement Patterns","Sparse Data","Road Network","Clustering Approach","Local Flow","Global Movement","Movement Vector","Movement Flow","Global Flows","Trajectory Data","Flow Map","Multiple Movements","Urban Movements","Vector Field"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3022359","title":"Uncertainty Visualization of 2D Morse Complex Ensembles Using Statistical Summary Maps","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"4","issn":"2160-9306","rank":162,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Scientific Computing & Imaging (SCI) Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077916100","id":37077916100,"full_name":"Tushar M.

They are widely applicable in scientific visualization as they serve as important abstractions for gaining insights into the topology of scalar fields. Data uncertainty inherent to scalar fields due to randomness in their acquisition and processing, however, limits our understanding of Morse complexes as structural abstractions. We, therefore, explore uncertainty visualization of an ensemble of 2D Morse complexes that arises from scalar fields coupled with data uncertainty. We propose several statistical summary maps as new entities for quantifying structural variations and visualizing positional uncertainties of Morse complexes in ensembles. Specifically, we introduce three types of statistical summary maps – the probabilistic map, the significance map, and the survival map – to characterize the uncertain behaviors of gradient flows. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed approach using wind, flow, and ocean eddy simulation datasets.","article_number":"9187994","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9187994","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9187994/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9187994/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9721431,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 April 2022","start_page":"1955","end_page":"1966","citing_paper_count":11,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":691,"insert_date":"20200908","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty","Visualization","Two dimensional displays","Data visualization","Entropy","Probabilistic logic","Color"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Morse complexes","uncertainty visualization","topological data analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Complex Ensemble","Uncertainty Visualization","Morse Complex","Probability Function","Probability Map","Simulated Datasets","Simulated Data Sets","Gradient Flow","Topological Indices","Topological Index","Topological Descriptors","Scientific Visualization","Critical Point","K-means","K-means Clustering","Local Maxima","Mean-field","Molecular Field","Mean-field Approximation","Vector Field","Local Neighborhood","Local Neighbourhood","Local Neighbourhoods","Local Neighborhoods","Field Gradient","High Entropy","Red Sea","Labeling Strategy","Labeling Scheme","White Box","Ensemble Members","Points In Domain","Clustering Strategy","Clustering Scheme","Yellow Region","Complex Plot","Black Contours","Structural Uncertainty","3D Flow","Uncertain Data","Types Of Maps","Toy Example"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2879672","title":"Scientific Visualization as a Microservice","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"4","issn":"2160-9306","rank":163,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086550104","id":37086550104,"full_name":"Mohammad Raji","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086324336","id":37086324336,"full_name":"Alok Hota","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088224285","id":37088224285,"full_name":"Tanner Hobson","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37281262900","id":37281262900,"full_name":"Jian Huang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this paper, we propose using a decoupled architecture to create a microservice that can deliver scientific visualization remotely with efficiency, scalability, and superior availability, affordability and accessibility.

In this article, we make a first step towards answering the question of whether an artificial neural network can predict where to sample the data with higher or lower density, by learning of correspondences between the data, the sampling patterns and the generated images. We introduce a novel neural rendering pipeline, which is trained end-to-end to generate a sparse adaptive sampling structure from a given low-resolution input image, and reconstructs a high-resolution image from the sparse set of samples. For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we demonstrate that the selection of structures that are relevant for the final visual representation can be jointly learned together with the reconstruction of this representation from these structures. Therefore, we introduce differentiable sampling and reconstruction stages, which can leverage back-propagation based on supervised losses solely on the final image. We shed light on the adaptive sampling patterns generated by the network pipeline and analyze its use for volume visualization including isosurface and direct volume rendering.","article_number":"9264699","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9264699","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9264699/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9264699/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9782589,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 July 2022","start_page":"2654","end_page":"2667","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":721,"insert_date":"20201119","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image reconstruction","Data visualization","Pipelines","Image resolution","Visualization","Rendering (computer graphics)","Neural networks"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Volume visualization","adaptive sampling","deep learning"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Adaptive Sampling","Neural Network","Higher Density","Artificial Neural Network","Neural Network Model","High-resolution Images","Visual Representation","Sample Stage","Final Image","Low-resolution Images","Isosurface","Sparse Sampling","Volume Rendering","Volumetric Rendering","Volume-rendering","Low-resolution Input","Pipeline Network","Training Data","Image Size","Image Reconstruction","Iterative Reconstruction","Tomographic Reconstruction","Supplementary Material Online","Residual Network","Peak Signal-to-noise Ratio","Peak Signal To Noise Ratio","PSNR","Network Reconstruction","Reconstruction Quality","Larger Image Size","Large-size Images","Reconstruction Accuracy","Residual Connection","Regular Sampling","Screen Space","Output Image","Importance Sampling","Training Step"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2017.38","title":"Physical Visualization of Geospatial Datasets","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"1558-1756","rank":166,"volume":"37","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086170138","id":37086170138,"full_name":"Hessam Djavaherpour","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38362700800","id":38362700800,"full_name":"Ali Mahdavi-Amiri","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38298814500","id":38298814500,"full_name":"Faramarz F.

The rendering of transparent lines is widely used for visualizing trajectories of tracer particles in flow fields.

Accurate blending of transparent lines requires rendering the lines in back-to-front or front-to-back order, yet enforcing this order for space-filling 3D line sets with extremely high-depth complexity becomes challenging. In this article, we study CPU and GPU rendering techniques for transparent 3D line sets. We compare accurate and approximate techniques using optimized implementations and several benchmark data sets. We discuss the effects of data size and transparency on quality, performance, and memory consumption. Based on our study, we propose two improvements to per-pixel fragment lists and multi-layer alpha blending. The first improves the rendering speed via an improved GPU sorting operation, and the second improves rendering quality via transparency-based bucketing.","article_number":"9007507","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9007507","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9007507/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9007507/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9468994,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 Aug. 2021","start_page":"3361","end_page":"3376","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":566,"insert_date":"20200224","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Ray tracing","Three-dimensional displays","Graphics processing units","Complexity theory","Acceleration","Image color analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Scientific visualization","line rendering","order-independent transparency"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["3D Line","Flow Field","Memory Consumption","3D Sets","Alpha Matte","Alpha Maps","Alpha Blending","Alpha Channel","Image Quality","Regular Grid","Cartesian Grid","Grid Structure","Rectangular Grid","Supplementary Material Online","Line Segment","Correct Order","Depth Values","High Transparency","Point Cloud Data","Triangular Mesh","Triangle Mesh","GPU Memory","Ray Tracing","Large Eddy Simulation","Large-eddy Simulation","Transmission Function","Sorting Algorithm","Bezier Curve","Cubic Bézier","Bézier Curves","Voxel Grid","Final Color","Final Colour","Multiple Intersections","Transparent Layer","Density Data","Storage Density","Ground Truth Image","Still Images","Percentage Of Users","Streamline"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2920157","title":"Detection and Visualization of Splat and Antisplat Events in Turbulent Flows","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"11","issn":"2160-9306","rank":168,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Institute of Computer Science, Leipzig University, Augustusplatz 10, Leipzig, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100148","id":37087100148,"full_name":"Baldwin Nsonga","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, Leipzig University, Augustusplatz 10, Leipzig, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Dresden, George-Bähr-Straße-3c, Institute of Fluid Mechanics, Dresden, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088518228","id":37088518228,"full_name":"Martin Niemann","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Dresden, George-Bähr-Straße-3c, Institute of Fluid Mechanics, Dresden, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Dresden, George-Bähr-Straße-3c, Institute of Fluid Mechanics, Dresden, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101680","id":37087101680,"full_name":"Jochen Fröhlich","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Dresden, George-Bähr-Straße-3c, Institute of Fluid Mechanics, Dresden, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Dresden, Nöthnitzer Straße 46, Institute of Software and Multimedia Technology, Dresden, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087098683","id":37087098683,"full_name":"Joachim Staib","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Dresden, Nöthnitzer Straße 46, Institute of Software and Multimedia Technology, Dresden, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Dresden, Nöthnitzer Straße 46, Institute of Software and Multimedia Technology, Dresden, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37565742800","id":37565742800,"full_name":"Stefan Gumhold","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Dresden, Nöthnitzer Straße 46, Institute of Software and Multimedia Technology, Dresden, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Computer Science, Leipzig University, Augustusplatz 10, Leipzig, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282574800","id":37282574800,"full_name":"Gerik Scheuermann","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, Leipzig University, Augustusplatz 10, Leipzig, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Splat and antisplat events are a widely found phenomenon in three-dimensional turbulent flow fields. Splats are observed when fluid locally impinges on an impermeable surface transferring energy from the normal component to the tangential velocity components, while antisplats relate to the inverted situation. These events affect a variety of flow properties, such as the transfer of kinetic energy between velocity components and the transfer of heat, so that their investigation can provide new insight into these issues. Here, we propose the first Lagrangian method for the detection of splats and antisplats as features of an unsteady flow field. Our method utilizes the concept of strain tensors on flow-embedded flat surfaces to extract disjoint regions in which splat and antisplat events of arbitrary scale occur. We validate the method with artificial flow fields of increasing complexity. Subsequently, the method is used to analyze application data stemming from a direct numerical simulation of the turbulent flow over a backward facing step. Our results show that splat and antisplat events can be identified efficiently and reliably even in such a complex situation, demonstrating that the new method constitutes a well-suited tool for the analysis of turbulent flows.","article_number":"8727493","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8727493","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8727493/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8727493/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9210268,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"1 Nov. 2020","start_page":"3147","end_page":"3162","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":622,"insert_date":"20190531","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Feature extraction","Data visualization","Visualization","Stress","Heat transfer","Strain","Solids"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Flow visualization","visualization techniques and methodologies"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Turbulent Flow","Heat Transfer","Flat Surface","Flow Field","Velocity Components","Steady Flow","Flow Simulation","Normal Component","Tangential Components","Direct Numerical Simulation","Tangential Velocity","Turbulent Flow Field","Flow Velocity","Integration Time","Flow Characteristics","Fluid Volume","Advection","Sample Length","Normal Direction","Parallel Surfaces","Forward Integration","Cauchy-Green Tensor","Pathlines","Massless Particles","Recirculation Region","No-slip Condition","Boundary Surface","Turbulent Boundary Layer","Solid Wall"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2856772","title":"Extreme-Scale Stochastic Particle Tracing for Uncertain Unsteady Flow Visualization and Analysis","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"9","issn":"2160-9306","rank":169,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085681553","id":37085681553,"full_name":"Hanqi Guo","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085433063","id":37085433063,"full_name":"Wenbin He","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Ground X Inc., Seoul, Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085447037","id":37085447037,"full_name":"Sangmin Seo","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Ground X Inc., Seoul, Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279493500","id":37279493500,"full_name":"Han-Wei Shen","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396873000","id":37396873000,"full_name":"Emil Mihai Constantinescu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Faculty of Science, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086931626","id":37086931626,"full_name":"Chunhui Liu","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Faculty of Science, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"]}},{"affiliation":"Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295026400","id":37295026400,"full_name":"Tom Peterka","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present an efficient and scalable solution to estimate uncertain transport behaviors - stochastic flow maps (SFMs) - for visualizing and analyzing uncertain unsteady flows. Computing flow maps from uncertain flow fields is extremely expensive because it requires many Monte Carlo runs to trace densely seeded particles in the flow. We reduce the computational cost by decoupling the time dependencies in SFMs so that we can process shorter sub time intervals independently and then compose them together for longer time periods. Adaptive refinement is also used to reduce the number of runs for each location. We parallelize over tasks-packets of particles in our design - to achieve high efficiency in MPI/thread hybrid programming. Such a task model also enables CPU/GPU coprocessing. We show the scalability on two supercomputers, Mira (up to 256K Blue Gene/Q cores) and Titan (up to 128K Opteron cores and 8K GPUs), that can trace billions of particles in seconds.","article_number":"8419325","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8419325","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8419325/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8419325/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8781959,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"1 Sept. 2019","start_page":"2710","end_page":"2724","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":583,"insert_date":"20180725","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Computational fluid dynamics","Computer graphics","Stochastic processes","Monte Carlo methods","Graphics processing units","Data analysis","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Parallel particle tracing","uncertain flow visualization","CPU-GPU hybrid parallelism"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Flow Analysis","Steady Flow","Unsteady Flow","Tracer Particles","Flow Visualization","Time Interval","Scalable","Monte Carlo Simulation","Monte Carlo Method","Parallelization","Parallel Computing","Flow Field","High-performance Computing","Supercomputer","Flow Map","Adaptive Refinement","Hybrid Program","Hybridization Programs","Uncertain Behavior","Uncertain Behaviour","CD4 T Cells","CD4 Cell","Th2 Cells","Adaptive Algorithm","Version Of Algorithm","Lipschitz Continuous","Lipschitz Constant","Lipschitz Continuity","Lipschitz Condition","Peak Signal-to-noise Ratio","Peak Signal To Noise Ratio","PSNR","Subintervals","Open Interval","Closed Interval","Uncertain Data","Weather Research And Forecasting","Parallel Algorithm","Oak Ridge National Laboratory","ORNL","Load Balancing","Differential Entropy","CPU Resources","Parallel Efficiency","Interval Of Interest","Time Interval Of Interest","Adaptive Mesh Refinement","P-refinement"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3042930","title":"Accelerating Unstructured Mesh Point Location With RT Cores","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"8","issn":"2160-9306","rank":170,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087129005","id":37087129005,"full_name":"Nate Morrical","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SCI Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"NVIDIA, Santa Clara, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282958300","id":37282958300,"full_name":"Ingo Wald","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["NVIDIA, Santa Clara, CA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085735276","id":37085735276,"full_name":"Will Usher","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SCI Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284312600","id":37284312600,"full_name":"Valerio Pascucci","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SCI Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present a technique that leverages ray tracing hardware available in recent Nvidia RTX GPUs to solve a problem other than classical ray tracing. Specifically, we demonstrate how to use these units to accelerate the point location of general unstructured elements consisting of both planar and bilinear faces. This unstructured mesh point location problem has previously been challenging to accelerate on GPU architectures; yet, the performance of these queries is crucial to many unstructured volume rendering and compute applications. Starting with a CUDA reference method, we describe and evaluate three approaches that reformulate these point queries to incrementally map algorithmic complexity to these new hardware ray tracing units. Each variant replaces the simpler problem of point queries with a more complex one of ray queries. Initial variants exploit ray tracing cores for accelerated BVH traversal, and subsequent variants use ray-triangle intersections and per-face metadata to detect point-in-element intersections. Although these later variants are more algorithmically complex, they are significantly faster than the reference method thanks to hardware acceleration. Using our approach, we improve the performance of an unstructured volume renderer by up to $4\\times$4× for tetrahedral meshes and up to $15\\times$15× for general bilinear element meshes, matching, or out-performing state-of-the-art solutions while simultaneously improving on robustness and ease-of-implementation.","article_number":"9286513","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9286513","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9286513/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9286513/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9811523,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 Aug. 2022","start_page":"2852","end_page":"2866","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":576,"insert_date":"20201208","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Ray tracing","Acceleration","Hardware","Graphics processing units","Rendering (computer graphics)","Computer architecture","Tensors"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Scientific ray tracing","unstructured scalar data","GPGPU","simulation","volume rendering"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Local Point","Unstructured Mesh","Reference Method","Reference Methods","Ray Tracing","Hardware Accelerators","Hardware-accelerated","Tetrahedral Mesh","Query Point","Volume Rendering","Volumetric Rendering","Volume-rendering","Transfer Function","Bounding Box","General Purpose","General Aim","Regular Grid","Cartesian Grid","Grid Structure","Rectangular Grid","Convex Hull","Hash Function","Hash Table","Hash Value","Hash Codes","Memory Usage","Unstructured Data","Unstructured Information","Scalar Value","Hexahedral","Hexahedron","Nonlinear Element","Front Face","Adaptive Sampling","Back Face","Reduce Memory Usage","Planar Case","Synthetic Benchmark","Arbitrary Direction","Use Of Core","GPU Computation","General-purpose GPUs","GPGPU","Interpolation","General Applicability","General Application"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.2977336","title":"Conceptual Model of Visual Analytics for Hands-on Cybersecurity Training","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"8","issn":"2160-9306","rank":171,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38220968800","id":38220968800,"full_name":"Radek Ošlejšek","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Computer Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085949730","id":37085949730,"full_name":"Vít Rusňák","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic"]}},{"affiliation":"Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086702461","id":37086702461,"full_name":"Karolína Burská","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Computer Science and Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088024250","id":37088024250,"full_name":"Valdemar Švábenský","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Computer Science and Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Computer Science and Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37596539800","id":37596539800,"full_name":"Jan Vykopal","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Computer Science and Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Computer Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085448808","id":37085448808,"full_name":"Jakub Čegan","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Hands-on training is an effective way to practice theoretical cybersecurity concepts and increase participants' skills.

Some bit flips may cause a program to crash or have a minimal effect on the output, but others may lead to silent data corruption (SDC), i.e., undetected yet significant output errors. Classical fault injection analysis methods employ uniform sampling of random bit flips during program execution to derive a statistical resiliency profile. However, summarizing such fault injection result with sufficient detail is difficult, and understanding the behavior of the fault-corrupted program is still a challenge. In this article, we introduce SpotSDC, a visualization system to facilitate the analysis of a program's resilience to SDC. SpotSDC provides multiple perspectives at various levels of detail of the impact on the output relative to where in the source code the flipped bit occurs, which bit is flipped, and when during the execution it happens. SpotSDC also enables users to study the code protection and provide new insights to understand the behavior of a fault-injected program.

The benefits of using simplicial spacetime meshes include (1) reducing ambiguity cases for feature extraction and tracking, (2) simplifying the handling of degeneracies using symbolic perturbations, and (3) enabling scalable and parallel processing. The use of simplicial spacetime meshing simplifies and improves the implementation of several feature-tracking algorithms for critical points, quantum vortices, and isosurfaces.

Different methods explore different criteria in choosing aspect ratios, but so far, it was still unclear how to select aspect ratios appropriately for any given data. This paper provides a guideline for the user to choose aspect ratios for any input 1D curves by conducting an in-depth analysis of aspect ratio selection methods both theoretically and experimentally. By formulating several existing methods as line integrals, we explain their parameterization invariance. Moreover, we derive a new and improved aspect ratio selection method, namely the $L_1$ -LOR (local orientation resolution), with a certain degree of parameterization invariance. Furthermore, we connect different methods, including AL (arc length based method), the banking to 45 $^\\circ$ principle, RV (resultant vector) and AS (average absolute slope), as well as  $L_1$ -LOR and AO (average absolute orientation). We verify these connections by a comparative evaluation involving various data sets, and show that the selections by RV and  $L_1$ -LOR are complementary to each other for most data. Accordingly, we propose the dual-scale banking technique that combines the strengths of RV and $L_1$ -LOR, and demonstrate its practicability using multiple real-world data sets.","article_number":"8239850","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8239850","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8239850/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8239850/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8511004,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"1 Dec. 2018","start_page":"3096","end_page":"3110","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":760,"insert_date":"20171225","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Banking","Robustness","Guidelines","Visual perception","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Aspect ratio","parameterization invariance","line integral","banking to 45 $^\\circ$    ","orientation resolution"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Aspect Ratio","Line Chart","Arc Length","Average Slope","Local Resolution","Average Orientation","Line Integral","Absolute Slope","Isothermal","Trends Data","Line Segment","Different Signs","Median Filter","Side Of Eq","Integrand","Multiple Segments","Large Aspect Ratio","Strong Noise","Slope Ratio","Line Orientation","Redundant Samples","Median Slope","2D Contour","2D Contour Plots","Noise Spikes","Length Of The Line Segment","Successive Segments"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3059294","title":"Scalable Scalable Vector Graphics: Automatic Translation of Interactive SVGs to a Multithread VDOM for Fast Rendering","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"9","issn":"2160-9306","rank":175,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085898951","id":37085898951,"full_name":"Michail Schwab","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087236804","id":37087236804,"full_name":"David Saffo","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089469300","id":37089469300,"full_name":"Nicholas Bond","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Brown University, Providence, RI, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656564","id":37088656564,"full_name":"Shash Sinha","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Brown University, Providence, RI, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38350716800","id":38350716800,"full_name":"Cody Dunne","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Brown University, Providence, RI, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085573766","id":37085573766,"full_name":"Jeff Huang","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Brown University, Providence, RI, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Brown University, Providence, RI, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38234180400","id":38234180400,"full_name":"James Tompkin","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Brown University, Providence, RI, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017334100","id":38017334100,"full_name":"Michelle A.

Because these attributes allow visualization creators to focus on design on implementation details, tools built on top of SVG, such as D3.js, are essential to the visualization community. However, slow SVG rendering can limit designs by effectively capping the number of on-screen data points, and this can force visualization creators to switch to Canvas or WebGL. These are less flexible (e.g., no search or styling via CSS), and harder to learn. We introduce Scalable Scalable Vector Graphics (SSVG) to reduce these limitations and allow complex and smooth visualizations to be created with SVG. SSVG automatically translates interactive SVG visualizations into a dynamic virtual DOM (VDOM) to bypass the browser's slow ‘to specification’ rendering by intercepting JavaScript function calls. De-coupling the SVG visualization specification from SVG rendering, and obtaining a dynamic VDOM, creates flexibility and opportunity for visualization system research. SSVG uses this flexibility to free up the main thread for more interactivity and renders the visualization with Canvas or WebGL on a web worker. Together, these concepts create a drop-in JavaScript library which can improve rendering performance by 3–9× with only one line of code added. To demonstrate applicability, we describe the use of SSVG on multiple example visualizations including published visualization research.

Monte Carlo (MC) path tracing is often used with surface models, yet its application for volumetric models is difficult due to the complexity of integrating MC light-paths in volumetric media with none or smooth material boundaries. Moreover, auxiliary geometry-buffers (G-buffers) produced for volumes are typically very noisy, failing to guide image denoisers relying on that information to preserve image details. This makes existing real-time denoisers, which take noise-free G-buffers as their input, less effective when denoising VPT images. We propose the necessary modifications to an image-based denoiser previously used when rendering surface models, and demonstrate effective denoising of VPT images. In particular, our denoising exploits temporal coherence between frames, without relying on noise-free G-buffers, which has been a common assumption of existing denoisers for surface-models. Our technique preserves high-frequency details through a weighted recursive least squares that handles heterogeneous noise for volumetric models. We show for various real data sets that our method improves the visual fidelity and temporal stability of VPT during classic DVR operations such as camera movements, modifications of the light sources, and editions to the volume transfer function.","article_number":"9258424","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9258424","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9258424/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9258424/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9782589,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 July 2022","start_page":"2734","end_page":"2747","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":976,"insert_date":"20201112","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Noise reduction","Real-time systems","Photonics","Media","Lighting","Transfer functions"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Volume rendering","global illumination","path-tracing","participating media","image-space filtering","real-time denoising"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Volume Rendering","Volumetric Rendering","Volume-rendering","Path Tracing","Real-time Denoising","Volumetric Path Tracing","Light Source","Transfer Function","Surface Model","Temporal Stability","Temporal Coherence","Recursive Least Squares","Volumetric Model","Scientific Visualization","Linear Model","Linear Regression Model","Temporal Features","Temporal Characteristics","Linear Prediction","Supplementary Video","Peak Signal-to-noise Ratio","Peak Signal To Noise Ratio","PSNR","Optical Flow","Interactive Visualization","Light Path","Pixel Color","Color Of Each Pixel","Colour Pixels","Reprojection","Denoising Methods","Denoising Method","Prediction Vector","World Coordinate","Caching","Monte Carlo Integration","Monte-Carlo Integration","Advanced Light","Chameleon","Cameleon","Optical Flow Estimation","Optical Flow Computation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2859974","title":"Preserving Command Line Workflow for a Package Management System Using ASCII DAG Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"9","issn":"2160-9306","rank":177,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490580100","id":38490580100,"full_name":"Katherine E.

However, users working in a remote command line environment must disrupt their workflow to visualize dependency graphs in graphical programs, possibly needing to move files between devices or incur forwarding lag. Such is the case for users of Spack, an open source package management system originally developed to ease the complex builds required by supercomputing environments. To preserve the command line workflow of Spack, we develop an interactive ASCII visualization for its dependency graphs. Through interviews with Spack maintainers, we identify user goals and corresponding visual tasks for dependency graphs. We evaluate the use of our visualization through a command line-centered study, comparing it to the system's two existing approaches.

With progressive visualization, users can examine intermediate results of complex or long running computations, without waiting for the computation to complete. While this has shown to be beneficial to users, recent research has identified potential risks. For example, users may misjudge the uncertainty in the intermediate results and draw incorrect conclusions or see patterns that are not present in the final results. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive set of studies to quantify the advantages and limitations of progressive visualization. Based on a recent report by Micallef et al., we examine four types of cognitive biases that can occur with progressive visualization: uncertainty bias, illusion bias, control bias, and anchoring bias. The results of the studies suggest a cautious but promising use of progressive visualization – while there can be significant savings in task completion time, accuracy can be negatively affected in certain conditions. These findings confirm earlier reports of the benefits and drawbacks of progressive visualization and that continued research into mitigating the effects of cognitive biases is necessary.","article_number":"9320596","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9320596","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9320596/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9320596/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9844883,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 Sept. 2022","start_page":"3093","end_page":"3112","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":758,"insert_date":"20210112","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Uncertainty","Bars","Task analysis","Real-time systems","Query processing","Data analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Progressive visualization","cognitive bias"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Cognitive Biases","Impact Of Bias","Impact Of Cognitive Biases","Large Amount Of Data","Completion Time","Effect Of Bias","Intermediate Results","Anchoring Effect","Task Completion Time","Results Of Experiments","Values Of Variables","Subset Of Data","Percentage Of Time","Types Of Tasks","Mechanical Turk","High School Diploma","Task Accuracy","Interactive Visualization","Influence Of Bias","Bar Height","Dynamic Uncertainties","Visual Working","Dynamic Visualization","Amount Of Uncertainty","Steering Control","Sampling Without Replacement","Bias Conditions","Sampling With Replacement"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2953026","title":"CMed: Crowd Analytics for Medical Imaging Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":179,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085387879","id":37085387879,"full_name":"Ji Hwan Park","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085891693","id":37085891693,"full_name":"Saad Nadeem","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086546371","id":37086546371,"full_name":"Saeed Boorboor","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37605959300","id":37605959300,"full_name":"Joseph Marino","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268052800","id":37268052800,"full_name":"Arie Kaufman","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present a visual analytics framework, CMed, for exploring medical image data annotations acquired from crowdsourcing.

As a first step towards such languages, we executed a study that catalogs how people represent constraint problems graphically. We studied three groups with different expertise: non-computer scientists, computer scientists and constraint programmers and analyzed their marks on paper (e.g., arrows), gestures (e.g., pointing) and the mappings to problem concepts (e.g., containers, sets).

The Phoenixmap approach starts by identifying the enclosed outline of the point collection, then assigns different widths to outline segments according to the segments' corresponding inside regions. Thus, one 2D distribution is represented as an outline with varied thicknesses. Phoenixmap is capable of overlaying multiple outlines and comparing them across categories of objects in a 2D space. We chose heatmap as a benchmark spatial visualization method and conducted user studies to compare performances among Phoenixmap, heatmap, and dot distribution map. Based on the analysis and participant feedback, we demonstrate that Phoenixmap 1) allows users to perceive and compare spatial distribution data efficiently; 2) frees up graphics space with a concise form that can provide visualization design possibilities like overlapping; and 3) provides a good quantitative perceptual estimating capability given the proper legends. Finally, we discuss several possible applications of Phoenixmap and present one visualization of multiple species of birds' active regions in a nature preserve.","article_number":"8861087","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8861087","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8861087/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8861087/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9340102,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 March 2021","start_page":"2000","end_page":"2014","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":675,"insert_date":"20191007","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Graphical models","Distribution functions","Heating systems","Image color analysis","Visualization","Geospatial analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","visualization","algorithms","geospastial analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Heatmap","Visual Methods","Visual Method","Objective Space","Multiple Distributions","Spatial Visualization","Spatial Distribution Of Data","Clustering Algorithm","Cognitive Load","Cognitive Demands","Mental Workload","Mental Effort","Density Map","Quantitative Estimates","Quantitative Calculation","Convex Hull","Training Tasks","Migratory Birds","Resident Species","Smooth Curve","Geospatial Data","Base Map","Basemap","Center Of The Circle","Political Boundaries","Kinds Of Objects","Continuous Curve","Bezier Curve","Cubic Bézier","Bézier Curves","Visual Encoding","Choropleth Maps","Political Leanings","Pink Dots","Changes In Distribution","Object Distance","Majority Of Users"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3038446","title":"Augmenting Parallel Coordinates Plots With Color-Coded Stacked Histograms","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"7","issn":"2160-9306","rank":182,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089408198","id":37089408198,"full_name":"Jinwook Bok","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, Seoul, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37594632900","id":37594632900,"full_name":"Bohyoung Kim","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, Seoul, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37422552700","id":37422552700,"full_name":"Jinwook Seo","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"]}}]},"access_type":"CCBY - IEEE is not the copyright holder of this material.

The color-coded histograms enable users to see an overview of the whole data without cluttering or scalability issues. Each rectangle in the PHP histograms is color coded according to the data ranking by a selected attribute. This color-coding scheme allows users to visually examine relationships between attributes, even between those that are displayed far apart, without repositioning or reordering axes. We adopt the Visual Information Seeking Mantra so that the polylines of the original PCP can be used to show details of a small number of selected items when the cluttering problem subsides. We also design interactions, such as a focus+context technique, to help users investigate small regions of interest in a space-efficient manner. We provide a real-world example in which PHP is effectively utilized compared with other visualizations, and we perform a controlled user study to evaluate the performance of PHP in helping users estimate the correlation between attributes. The results demonstrate that the performance of PHP was consistent in the estimation of correlations between two attributes regardless of the distance between them.","article_number":"9262081","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9262081","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9262081/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9262081/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9782589,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 July 2022","start_page":"2563","end_page":"2576","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1619,"insert_date":"20201117","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Histograms","Image color analysis","Visualization","Bars","Data visualization","Correlation","Layout"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Parallel coordinates plots","parallel histogram plots","color-coded stacked histogram"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Parallel Coordinates Plot","Scalable","User Study","Color Code","Colour Code","Color-coding","Correlation Estimates","Overview Of Data","Color Scheme","Colour Scheme","Polyline","Positive Correlation","Interaction Effect","Error Rate","Repeated Measures ANOVA","Repeated-measures ANOVA","Repeated-measures Analysis Of Variance","Repeated Measures Analysis Of Variance","Multiple Dimensions","Multiple Attributes","Multiple Properties","Estimation Performance","Color Map","Colour Map","Colormap","Mean SD","Mean SDs","Group Of Items","Light Bulb","Color Distribution","Colour Distribution","Task Completion Time","Small Bars","Scatterplot Matrix","Scatter Plot Matrix","Scatterplot Matrices","Item Clusters","Visual Encoding","Stacked Bar","Histogram Bars","Space Efficiency","Stacked Bar Charts","Latin Square","Response Experiments"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2879866","title":"eFESTA: Ensemble Feature Exploration with Surface Density Estimates","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"4","issn":"2160-9306","rank":183,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085433063","id":37085433063,"full_name":"Wenbin He","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085681553","id":37085681553,"full_name":"Hanqi Guo","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279493500","id":37279493500,"full_name":"Han-Wei Shen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295026400","id":37295026400,"full_name":"Tom Peterka","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We propose surface density estimate (SDE) to model the spatial distribution of surface features-isosurfaces, ridge surfaces, and streamsurfaces-in 3D ensemble simulation data. The inputs of SDE computation are surface features represented as polygon meshes, and no field datasets are required (e.g., scalar fields or vector fields). The SDE is defined as the kernel density estimate of the infinite set of points on the input surfaces and is approximated by accumulating the surface densities of triangular patches. We also propose an algorithm to guide the selection of a proper kernel bandwidth for SDE computation. An ensemble Feature Exploration method based on Surface densiTy EstimAtes (eFESTA) is then proposed to extract and visualize the major trends of ensemble surface features. For an ensemble of surface features, each surface is first transformed into a density field based on its contribution to the SDE, and the resulting density fields are organized into a hierarchical representation based on the pairwise distances between them. The hierarchical representation is then used to guide visual exploration of the density fields as well as the underlying surface features. We demonstrate the application of our method using isosurface in ensemble scalar fields, Lagrangian coherent structures in uncertain unsteady flows, and streamsurfaces in ensemble fluid flows.","article_number":"8525340","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8525340","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8525340/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8525340/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9016330,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"1 April 2020","start_page":"1716","end_page":"1731","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":475,"insert_date":"20181106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Feature extraction","Uncertainty","Estimation","Isosurfaces","Visualization","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Density estimation","ensemble data visualization","uncertainty visualization","feature exploration"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Surface Density","Area Density","Areal Density","Density Estimation","Ensemble Feature","Surface Characteristics","Surface Features","Kernel Density","Vector Field","3D Mesh","Surface Mesh","Isosurface","Density Field","Ensemble Simulations","Hierarchical Representation","Visual Exploration","Field Dataset","Field Data Sets","Bandwidth Selection","Grid Cells","Grid Points","Kernel Function","Standard Normal Distribution","Standard Gaussian Distribution","Peak Signal-to-noise Ratio","Peak Signal To Noise Ratio","PSNR","Visualization Techniques","Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics","Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics","Ensemble Members","Hierarchical Clustering Tree","Grid Resolution","Density Estimation Method","Density Estimation Methods","Number Of Ensemble Members","Amount Of Smoothing","Hierarchical Tree","Symmetric Positive Definite Matrix","Symmetric Positive-definite Matrix","Spherical Volume"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3061925","title":"Visual Analysis of Multi-Parameter Distributions Across Ensembles of 3D Fields","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"10","issn":"2160-9306","rank":184,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics & Visualization Group, Technical University of Munich (TUM), München, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086259273","id":37086259273,"full_name":"Alexander Kumpf","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics & Visualization Group, Technical University of Munich (TUM), München, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics & Visualization Group, Technical University of Munich (TUM), München, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089513643","id":37089513643,"full_name":"Josef Stumpfegger","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics & Visualization Group, Technical University of Munich (TUM), München, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics & Visualization Group, Technical University of Munich (TUM), München, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089512599","id":37089512599,"full_name":"Patrick Fabian Härtl","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics & Visualization Group, Technical University of Munich (TUM), München, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics & Visualization Group, Technical University of Munich (TUM), München, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37444424000","id":37444424000,"full_name":"Rüdiger Westermann","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics & Visualization Group, Technical University of Munich (TUM), München, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"For an ensemble of 3D multi-parameter fields, we present a visual analytics workflow to analyse whether and which parts of a selected multi-parameter distribution is present in all ensemble members.

The DNA's extremely long sequential structure—arranged differently on several distinct scale levels—is often lost in traditional 3D depictions, mainly due to its multiple levels of dense spatial packing and the resulting occlusion. Furthermore, interactive exploration of this complex structure is cumbersome, requiring visibility management like cut-aways. In contrast to existing temporally controlled multiscale data exploration, we allow viewers to always see and interact with any of the involved scales. For this purpose we separate the depiction into constant-scale and scale transition zones. Constant-scale zones maintain a single-scale representation, while still linearly unfolding the DNA. Inspired by illustration, scale transition zones connect adjacent constant-scale zones via level unfolding, scaling, and transparency. We thus represent the spatial structure of the whole DNA macro-molecule, maintain its local organizational characteristics, linearize its higher-level organization, and use spatially controlled, understandable interpolation between neighboring scales. We also contribute interaction techniques that provide viewers with a coarse-to-fine control for navigating within our all-scales-in-one-view representations and visual aids to illustrate the size differences. Overall, Multiscale Unfolding allows viewers to grasp the DNA's structural composition from chromosomes to the atoms, with increasing levels of “unfoldedness,” and can be applied in data-driven illustration and communication.","article_number":"9376675","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9376675","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9376675/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9376675/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9874356,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 Oct. 2022","start_page":"3456","end_page":"3470","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":889,"insert_date":"20210311","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","DNA","Genomics","Bioinformatics","Visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Navigation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Multiscale visualization","spatially-controlled scale transition","visual abstraction","illustrative visualization","genome","DNA"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Navigation","Spatial Structure","Multiple Scales","Transition Zone","Sequence Structure","Scale Level","Spatial Control","Interactive Exploration","Single View","Interaction Techniques","Multi-scale Data","Genomic Data","3D Structure","Spatial Scales","DNA Structures","DNA Topology","End Of Sequence","Domain Experts","Spatial Module","Spatial Configuration","Visualization Techniques","Detailed Scale","Chromosome Scale","Multi-scale Representation","Nucleosome Positioning","Representative Scale","Scale Elements","Visual Map","Linker DNA","Partial Transition","Position Of Loci"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2841385","title":"Popup-Plots: Warping Temporal Data Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"7","issn":"2160-9306","rank":186,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"AIT Austrian Institute of Technology, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077239600","id":37077239600,"full_name":"Johanna Schmidt","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["AIT Austrian Institute of Technology, Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Stanford University, Stanford University, Stanford, CA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282581000","id":37282581000,"full_name":"Dominik Fleischmann","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Stanford University, Stanford University, Stanford, CA"]}},{"affiliation":"Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37424645300","id":37424645300,"full_name":"Bernhard Preim","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"AIT Austrian Institute of Technology, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37659207900","id":37659207900,"full_name":"Norbert Brändle","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["AIT Austrian Institute of Technology, Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233231400","id":38233231400,"full_name":"Gabriel Mistelbauer","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Temporal data visualization is used to analyze dependent variables that vary over time, with time being an independent variable. Visualizing temporal data is inherently difficult, due to the many aspects that need to be communicated to the users (e.g., time and variable changes). This is an important topic in visualization, and a wide range of visualization techniques dealing with different tasks have already been designed. In this paper we propose popup-plots, a novel concept where the common interaction of 3D rotation is used to navigate through the data. This allows the users to view the data from different perspectives without having to learn and adapt to new interaction concepts. Popup-plots are therefore a novel method for visualizing and interacting with dependent variables over time. We extend 2D plots with the temporal information by bending the space according to the time. The bending is calculated based on a spherical coordinates approach, which is continuously influenced by the viewing direction towards the plot. Hence, the plot can be viewed from various angles with seamless transitions in between, offering the possibility to analyze different aspects of the represented data. As the current viewing direction is inherently depicted by the shape of the data, the users are able to deduce which part of the data is currently viewed. The temporal information is encoded into the visualization itself, resembling annual rings of a tree. We demonstrate our method by applying it to data from two different domains, comprising measurements at spatial positions over time, and we also evaluated the usability of our solution.","article_number":"8368315","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8368315","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8368315/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8368315/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8723245,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"1 July 2019","start_page":"2443","end_page":"2457","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":761,"insert_date":"20180529","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Two dimensional displays","Temperature measurement","Time measurement","Layout"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Temporal data","time-dependent visualization","3D plots","ellipsoidal coordinate system"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Visualization","Temporal Data","Dependent Variable","Temporal Information","Visualization Techniques","3D Rotation","Seamless Transition","Patterns In Data","Visual Representation","User Study","Viewing Angle","Third Dimension","Outlier Data","Matter Interaction","3D Visualization","Aspects Of The Data","Traffic Data","3D Datasets","3D Data Sets","Temporal Progression","Rush Hour","Ellipsoid Model","Ellipsoidal Model","Quadric","Parallel Coordinates","Hyperboloid","Grid Lines","Conventional Plots","11-point Likert Scale","Combined Trajectory","Visual Map","Aortic Diameter"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.2984708","title":"Dataless Sharing of Interactive Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"9","issn":"2160-9306","rank":187,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086550104","id":37086550104,"full_name":"Mohammad Raji","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088398771","id":37088398771,"full_name":"Jeremiah Duncan","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088224285","id":37088224285,"full_name":"Tanner Hobson","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37281262900","id":37281262900,"full_name":"Jian Huang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Interactive visualization has become a powerful insight-revealing medium.

In this work, we fill the gap between the two extremes and present a new system, called Loom. Loom captures interactive visualizations as standalone dataless objects. Users can interact with Loom objects as if they still have the original software and data that created those visualizations. Yet, Loom objects are completely independent and can therefore be shared online without requiring the data or the visualization software. Loom objects are efficient to store and use, and provide privacy preserving mechanisms. We demonstrate Loom's efficacy with examples of scientific visualization using Paraview, information visualization using Tableau, and journalistic visualization from New York Times.","article_number":"9056539","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9056539","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9056539/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9056539/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9501051,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 Sept. 2021","start_page":"3656","end_page":"3669","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":969,"insert_date":"20200403","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Software","Videos","Visualization","Tools","Graphical user interfaces","Containers"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Shareable visualizations","visualization recordings","user interaction"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive Visualization","Visual Information","Origin Software","Original Packaging","Scientific Visualization","Types Of Interactions","Encryption","Ciphertext","Workspace","Graphical User Interface","Graphical Interface","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Tree Nodes","State Machine","Finite-state","Finite State","Finite State Machine","Finite-state Machine","Root Of The Tree","Visual Responses","Visual Map","Vision Applications","Image Compression","Target Shape","3D Rotation","Type Of Visualization","Menu Items","Video Compression","Web-based Visualization","Smart Tools","Complete Object","Leaf Node","JavaScript","Visual Elements","Magic Wand","Modern Web Browser","Modern Browsers","Interactive Elements"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2898438","title":"Measuring the Effects of Scalar and Spherical Colormaps on Ensembles of DMRI Tubes","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"9","issn":"2160-9306","rank":188,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Science and Engineering Department, The Ohio State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38107662400","id":38107662400,"full_name":"Jian Chen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, The Ohio State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088451147","id":37088451147,"full_name":"Guohao Zhang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088451172","id":37088451172,"full_name":"Wesley Chiou","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Brown University, Providence, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275712600","id":37275712600,"full_name":"David H.

The experiment tested six scalar colormaps for average fractional anisotropy (FA) tasks (grayscale, blackbody, diverging, isoluminant-rainbow, extended-blackbody, and coolwarm) and four three-dimensional (3D) spherical colormaps for tract tracing tasks (uniform gray, absolute, eigenmaps, and Boy's surface embedding). We found that extended-blackbody, coolwarm, and blackbody remain the best three approaches for identifying ensemble average in 3D. Isoluminant-rainbow colormap led to the same ensemble mean accuracy as other colormaps. However, more than 50 percent of the answers consistently had higher estimates of the ensemble average, independent of the mean values. The number of hues, not luminance, influences ensemble estimates of mean values. For ensemble orientation-tracing tasks, we found that both Boy's surface embedding (greatest spatial resolution and contrast) and absolute colormaps (lowest spatial resolution and contrast) led to more accurate answers than the eigenmaps scheme (medium resolution and contrast), acting as the uncanny-valley phenomenon of visualization design in terms of accuracy. Absolute colormap broadly used in brain science is a good default spherical colormap. We could conclude from our study that human visual processing of a chunk of colors differs from that of single colors.","article_number":"8637778","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8637778","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8637778/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8637778/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9152193,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"1 Sept. 2020","start_page":"2818","end_page":"2833","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":838,"insert_date":"20190208","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image color analysis","Task analysis","Visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Color","Spatial resolution"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Ensemble visualization","diffusion magnetic resonance imaging","quantitative validation","colormap"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Diffusion Tensor Imaging","Diffusion-weighted Imaging","Diffusion Weighted Imaging","Diffusion Tensor","Color Map","Colour Map","Colormap","Spatial Resolution","Grayscale","Greyscale","Gray Level","Visual Processing","Ensemble Average","Ensemble-averaged","Blackbody","Blackbody Radiation","Fractional Anisotropy","Brain Science","Visual Design","Average Fractional Anisotropy","Illumination","Lighting","Difference In Accuracy","C=O Groups","Vector Field","Color Space","Colour Space","Color Components","Discrimination Task","3D Visualization","Tractography","Latin Square","Average Task","Task Completion Time","Vision Science","Orientation Discrimination","Principal Eigenvector","Distribution Of Bins","Human Visual System","Just Noticeable Difference","Just-noticeable-difference","Medical School Students","Average Brain"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2920130","title":"Ray-Based Exploration of Large Time-Varying Volume Data Using Per-Ray Proxy Distributions","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"11","issn":"2160-9306","rank":189,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086057389","id":37086057389,"full_name":"Ko-Chih Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086047154","id":37086047154,"full_name":"Tzu-Hsuan Wei","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37355552900","id":37355552900,"full_name":"Naeem Shareef","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279493500","id":37279493500,"full_name":"Han-Wei Shen","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The analysis and visualization of data created from simulations on modern supercomputers is a daunting challenge because the incredible compute power of modern supercomputers allow scientists to generate datasets with very high spatial and temporal resolutions. The limited bandwidth and capacity of networking and storage devices connecting supercomputers to analysis machines become the major bottleneck for data analysis such that simply moving the whole dataset from the supercomputer to a data analysis machine is infeasible. A common approach to visualize high temporal resolution simulation datasets under constrained I/O is to reduce the sampling rate in the temporal domain while preserving the original spatial resolution at the time steps. Data interpolation between the sampled time steps alone may not be a viable option since it may suffer from large errors, especially when using a lower sampling rate. We present a novel ray-based representation storing ray based histograms and depth information that recovers the evolution of volume data between sampled time steps. Our view-dependent proxy allows for a good trade off between compactly representing the time-varying data and leveraging temporal coherence within the data by utilizing interpolation between time steps, ray histograms, depth information, and codebooks. Our approach is able to provide fast rendering in the context of transfer function exploration to support visualization of feature evolution in time-varying data.","article_number":"8727480","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8727480","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8727480/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8727480/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9210268,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"1 Nov. 2020","start_page":"3299","end_page":"3313","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":426,"insert_date":"20190531","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Histograms","Interpolation","Rendering (computer graphics)","Transfer functions","Data visualization","Data models","Supercomputers"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","time-varying data","large data modeling","scientific simulation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Time-varying Data","Time-varying Volume","Time Step","Transfer Function","High-performance Computing","Supercomputer","Evolution Characteristics","Evolutionary Features","Depth Information","Temporal Domain","Good Trade-off","Temporal Coherence","High-resolution Simulations","Root Mean Square Error","Root-mean-square Deviation","Root-mean-square Error","RMSD","RMSE","Peak Signal-to-noise Ratio","Peak Signal To Noise Ratio","PSNR","Depth Profile","Reconstruction Quality","Storage Cost","Compact Representation","Scalar Value","Image Coordinates","List Of Values","Bitwise Operations","Bit Operations","Non-zero Probability","Subrange","Binary Index","Bitmap Index","Bit Indices","Index Bits","Histogram Bins","Representative Histograms","Number Of Rays","Probability Interval","Lossy Compression","Pixel Color","Color Of Each Pixel","Colour Pixels"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.2993992","title":"Void Space Surfaces to Convey Depth in Vessel Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"10","issn":"2160-9306","rank":190,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Visual Computing Group, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086226012","id":37086226012,"full_name":"Julian Kreiser","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Computing Group, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Visual Computing Group, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085889295","id":37085889295,"full_name":"Pedro Hermosilla","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Computing Group, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Visual Computing Group, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295281400","id":37295281400,"full_name":"Timo Ropinski","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Computing Group, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"To enhance depth perception and thus data comprehension, additional depth cues are often used in 3D visualizations of complex vascular structures. There is a variety of different approaches described in the literature, ranging from chromadepth color coding over depth of field to glyph-based encodings. Unfortunately, the majority of existing approaches suffers from the same problem: As these cues are directly applied to the geometry's surface, the display of additional information on the vessel wall, such as other modalities or derived attributes, is impaired. To overcome this limitation we propose Void Space Surfaces which utilizes empty space in between vessel branches to communicate depth and their relative positioning. This allows us to enhance the depth perception of vascular structures without interfering with the spatial data and potentially superimposed parameter information. With this article, we introduce Void Space Surfaces, describe their technical realization, and show their application to various vessel trees. Moreover, we report the outcome of two user studies which we have conducted in order to evaluate the perceptual impact of Void Space Surfaces compared to existing vessel visualization techniques and discuss expert feedback.","article_number":"9091253","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9091253","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9091253/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9091253/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9526678,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 Oct. 2021","start_page":"3913","end_page":"3925","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":419,"insert_date":"20200511","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image color analysis","Visualization","Data visualization","Surface morphology","Shape","Rendering (computer graphics)","Biomedical imaging"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Depth perception","void space surface","chromadepth"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Void Space","User Study","Color Code","Colour Code","Color-coding","Visualization Techniques","Depth Perception","Depth Cues","Additional Cues","Visible Vessels","Response Time","Function Parameters","State Of The Art","State-of-the-art","Domain Experts","Maximum Intensity Projection","Static Images","Colorblind","Color Blindness","Colour-blind","Color Vision Deficiency","Differences In Depth","Depth Values","Color Scheme","Colour Scheme","Wall Shear Stress","Inverse Distance Weighting","Surface Vessels","Vascular Model","Shape Perception","Vessel Structure","Volume Dataset","Volume Data Sets","Global Shape","Vascular Surface","Empty Areas","Power Parameter","GPU Implementation","Goal In Mind"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3052167","title":"Shape-Driven Coordinate Ordering for Star Glyph Sets via Reinforcement Learning","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":191,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102312","id":37087102312,"full_name":"Ruizhen Hu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37080128400","id":37080128400,"full_name":"Bin Chen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088864883","id":37088864883,"full_name":"Juzhan Xu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101740","id":37087101740,"full_name":"Oliver van Kaick","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266781000","id":37266781000,"full_name":"Oliver Deussen","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany","SIAT Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086110259","id":37086110259,"full_name":"Hui Huang","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present a neural optimization model trained with reinforcement learning to solve the coordinate ordering problem for sets of star glyphs. Given a set of star glyphs associated to multiple class labels, we propose to use shape context descriptors to measure the perceptual distance between pairs of glyphs, and use the derived silhouette coefficient to measure the perception of class separability within the entire set. To find the optimal coordinate order for the given set, we train a neural network using reinforcement learning to reward orderings with high silhouette coefficients. The network consists of an encoder and a decoder with an attention mechanism. The encoder employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) to encode input shape and class information, while the decoder together with the attention mechanism employs another RNN to output a sequence with the new coordinate order. In addition, we introduce a neural network to efficiently estimate the similarity between shape context descriptors, which allows to speed up the computation of silhouette coefficients and thus the training of the axis ordering network. Two user studies demonstrate that the orders provided by our method are preferred by users for perceiving class separation. We tested our model on different settings to show its robustness and generalization abilities and demonstrate that it allows to order input sets with unseen data size, data dimension, or number of classes.

This enables the definition of efficient coarse-to-fine topological algorithms, which leverage fast update mechanisms for ordinary vertices and avoid computation for the topologically invariant ones. We demonstrate our approach with two examples of topological algorithms (critical point extraction and persistence diagram computation), which generate interpretable outputs upon interruption requests and which progressively refine them otherwise. Experiments on real-life datasets illustrate that our progressive strategy, in addition to the continuous visual feedback it provides, even improves run time performance with regard to non-progressive algorithms and we describe further accelerations with shared-memory parallelism.

Current approaches overcome this problem by using focus on specific elements that are then rendered opaque, and carving away all elements occluding their view. In this work, we make use of advanced GPU shader functionality to generate a focus+context rendering that highlights the elements in a selected region and simultaneously conveys the global mesh structure and deformation field. To achieve this, we propose a gradual transition from edge-based focus rendering to volumetric context rendering, by combining fragment shader-based edge and face rendering with per-pixel fragment lists. A fragment shader smoothly transitions between wireframe and face-based rendering, including focus-dependent rendering style and depth-dependent edge thickness and halos, and per-pixel fragment lists are used to blend fragments in correct visibility order. To maintain the global mesh structure in the context regions, we propose a new method to construct a sheet-based level-of-detail hierarchy and smoothly blend it with volumetric information. The user guides the exploration process by moving a lens-like hotspot. Since all operations are performed on the GPU, interactive frame rates are achieved even for large meshes.","article_number":"9409710","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9409710","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9409710/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9409710/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9468994,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 Aug. 2021","start_page":"3505","end_page":"3518","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":377,"insert_date":"20210420","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Strain","Visualization","Faces","Graphics processing units","Inspection","Sorting"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization of hex-meshes","real-time rendering","GPUs"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Hexahedral Mesh","Smoothing","Visual Inspection","Volumetric","Global Structure","Smooth Transition","Correct Order","Mesh Structure","Interlocked Structure","Deformation Field","Edge Thickness","Fragments In Order","Large Datasets","Large Data Sets","Iterative Process","Cells In Region","Important Regions","Visualization Tool","Simulation Accuracy","Global View","Cell Deformation","Pair Of Components","Edge Coloring","Edge-coloring","Volume Rendering","Volumetric Rendering","Volume-rendering","Facial Color","Facial Colour","Screen Space","Hexahedral Elements","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Priority Queue","Merging Process","Amalgamation Process","GPU Memory"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3017568","title":"Geometry-Driven Detection, Tracking and Visual Analysis of Viscous and Gravitational Fingers","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"2160-9306","rank":194,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086924444","id":37086924444,"full_name":"Jiayi Xu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Data Science at Scale Team, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077202300","id":37077202300,"full_name":"Soumya Dutta","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Data Science at Scale Team, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085433063","id":37085433063,"full_name":"Wenbin He","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Earth Sciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086386023","id":37086386023,"full_name":"Joachim Moortgat","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Earth Sciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279493500","id":37279493500,"full_name":"Han-Wei Shen","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Viscous and gravitational flow instabilities cause a displacement front to break up into finger-like fluids. The detection and evolutionary analysis of these fingering instabilities are critical in multiple scientific disciplines such as fluid mechanics and hydrogeology. However, previous detection methods of the viscous and gravitational fingers are based on density thresholding, which provides limited geometric information of the fingers. The geometric structures of fingers and their evolution are important yet little studied in the literature. In this article, we explore the geometric detection and evolution of the fingers in detail to elucidate the dynamics of the instability. We propose a ridge voxel detection method to guide the extraction of finger cores from three-dimensional (3D) scalar fields. After skeletonizing finger cores into skeletons, we design a spanning tree based approach to capture how fingers branch spatially from the finger skeletons. Finally, we devise a novel geometric-glyph augmented tracking graph to study how the fingers and their branches grow, merge, and split over time. Feedback from earth scientists demonstrates the usefulness of our approach to performing spatio-temporal geometric analyses of fingers.","article_number":"9170853","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9170853","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9170853/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9170853/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9695945,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 March 2022","start_page":"1514","end_page":"1528","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":359,"insert_date":"20200818","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Earth","Three-dimensional displays","Skeleton","Feature extraction","Fingers","Computer science"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Viscous and gravitational fingering","topological and geometric data analysis","ridge detection","spatio-temporal visualization","tracking graph"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Viscous Fingering","Detection Methods","Detection Method","Earth Science","Hydrogeological","Flow Instability","Critical Point","Power-law","Scaling Law","Power Law","Grid Cells","Taylor Series","Taylor Approximation","Quadratic Approximation","Viscous Fluid","Point Flow","Viscous Liquid","Viscous Liquids","Viscous Fluids","Convex Hull","Extreme Points","Mapping Project","Spatial Projection","Density Field","Voronoi Diagram","Voronoi Tessellation","Voronoi Cell","High-density Regions","Skeletonization","3D Region","Ridgeline","Ridge Line","Crest Lines","Consecutive Time Steps","Consecutive Timesteps","Multiple Fingers","Individual Finger","Finger Individuation","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Splitting Events","Scientific Visualization","Time And Space","Spacetime","Planar Graphs","Planar Maps","Geometric Features","Geometric Characteristics","Scalar Value","Hessian Matrix","Hessian Matrices"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.3012778","title":"TransVis: Integrated Distant and Close Reading of Othello Translations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":195,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Swansea University, Swansea, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088804667","id":37088804667,"full_name":"Mohammad Alharbi","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Swansea University, Swansea, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267247900","id":37267247900,"full_name":"Robert S Laramee","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Arts and Humanities, Swansea University, Swansea, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088805153","id":37088805153,"full_name":"Tom Cheesman","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Arts and Humanities, Swansea University, Swansea, UK"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Studying variation among time-evolved translations is a valuable research area for cultural heritage.

We provide a range of filtering and selection options to customize the alignment overview as well as focus on specific subsets. Selection and filtering are responsive to expert user preferences and update the analytical text metrics interactively. Also, we introduce a customized view for close reading which preserves the history of selections and the alignment overview state and enables backtracing and re-examining them. Finally, we present a new Term-Level Comparisons view (TLC) to compare and convey relative term weighting in the context of an alignment.

In particular, through the analysis of photometric and polarimetric observations of blazars, astronomers aim to understand the physics of the blazar's relativistic jet. However, it is challenging to recognize correlations and time variations of the observed polarization, intensity, and color of the emitted light. In our prior study, we proposed TimeTubes to visualize a blazar dataset as a 3D volumetric tube. In this paper, we build primarily on the TimeTubes representation of blazar datasets to present a new visual analytics environment named TimeTubesX, into which we have integrated sophisticated feature and pattern detection techniques for effective location of observable and recurring time variation patterns in long-term, multi-dimensional datasets. Automatic feature extraction detects time intervals corresponding to well-known blazar behaviors. Dynamic visual querying allows users to search long-term observations for time intervals similar to a time interval of interest (query-by-example) or a sketch of temporal patterns (query-by-sketch). Users are also allowed to build up another visual query guided by the time interval of interest found in the previous process and refine the results. We demonstrate how TimeTubesX has been used successfully by domain experts for the detailed analysis of blazar datasets and report on the results.","article_number":"9200781","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9200781","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9200781/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9200781/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9721431,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"1 April 2022","start_page":"1917","end_page":"1929","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":437,"insert_date":"20200918","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Feature extraction","Image color analysis","Correlation","Three-dimensional displays","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","feature extraction","visual query","multi-dimensional","time-dependent visualization","astrophysics","blazar"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Polarimetric","Spectropolarimeter","Polarimetry","Visual Exploration","Time Interval","Time-variant","Time Variation","Polarized Light","Feature Detection","Domain Experts","Detection Of Patterns","Automatic Feature Extraction","Multidimensional Datasets","Multidimensional Data Sets","Celestial Bodies","Celestial Objects","Astronomical Objects","Heavenly Bodies","Astronomers","Interval Of Interest","Time Interval Of Interest","Well-known Behavior","Well-known Behaviour","Time Series","Time-series","Time Series Data","Time-series Data","Similar Shape","Similar Figure","Similar Geometry","Visual Task","Dynamic Variables","Kinetic Variables","Matching Algorithm","Query Results","Dynamic Time Warping","Hiroshima University","Interval Period","Periodic Intervals","Observation Error","Constant Error","Visual Framework","Long-term Datasets","Long-term Data Sets","Time-dependent Data","Time Dependent Data","Iterative Refinement","Bezier Curve","Cubic Bézier","Bézier Curves"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2020.2985923","title":"AgentVis: Visual Analysis of Agent Behavior With Hierarchical Glyphs","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"9","issn":"2160-9306","rank":198,"volume":"27","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Swansea University, Swansea, United Kingdom","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088804579","id":37088804579,"full_name":"Dylan Rees","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Swansea University, Swansea, United Kingdom"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267247900","id":37267247900,"full_name":"Robert S.

However, due to their complex shape, overlapping, and occlusion of glyphs is a common and prominent limitation. This limits the number of discreet data tuples that can be displayed in a given image. Using a real-world application, glyphs are used to depict agent behavior in a call center. However, many call centers feature thousands of agents. A standard approach representing thousands of agents with glyphs does not scale. To accommodate the visualization incorporating thousands of glyphs we develop clustering of overlapping glyphs into a single parent glyph. This hierarchical glyph represents the mean value of all child agent glyphs, removing overlap and reduTcing visual clutter. Multi-variate clustering techniques are explored and developed in collaboration with domain experts in the call center industry. We implement dynamic control of glyph clusters according to zoom level and customized distance metrics, to utilize image space with reduced overplotting and cluttering. We demonstrate our technique with examples and a usage scenario using real-world call-center data to visualize thousands of call center agents, revealing insight into their behavior and reporting feedback from expert call-center analysts.","article_number":"9067088","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9067088","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9067088/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9067088/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9501051,"publication_year":2021,"publication_date":"1 Sept. 2021","start_page":"3626","end_page":"3643","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":569,"insert_date":"20200414","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Industries","Visualization","Clutter","Collaboration","Measurement","Shape"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Glyph","clustering","multivariate visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Behavior Of Agents","Behaviour Of Agents","Domain Experts","Distance Metrics","Usage Scenarios","Zoom Level","Cluttering","Single Agent","New Variables","Individual Agency","Bar Charts","Smooth Transition","Color Map","Colour Map","Colormap","Number Of Agents","Number Of Assignments","Number Of Names","Number Of Designs","Distance Clustering","Placement Strategy","Placement Scheme","Schemes Of Arrangement","Visual Design","Single Axis","Number Of Data Samples","Avenue For Future Work","Scatterplot Matrix","Scatter Plot Matrix","Scatterplot Matrices","Data-driven Strategy","Properties Of Agents","Agentic Attributes","Properties Of These Agents","Screen Space","Parallel Coordinates","Multiple Axes","Multiple Dimensions","Multiple Attributes","Multiple Properties","End Of The Project","Design Solutions","Identification Of Solutions","Large Datasets","Large Data Sets"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2796555","title":"Efficient Local Statistical Analysis via Point-Wise Histograms in Tetrahedral Meshes and Curvilinear Grids","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":199,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"CSE Department, New York University, Brooklyn, NY","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38529366000","id":38529366000,"full_name":"Bo Zhou","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["CSE Department, New York University, Brooklyn, NY"]}},{"affiliation":"CSE Department, New York University, Brooklyn, NY","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37288235400","id":37288235400,"full_name":"Yi-Jen Chiang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["CSE Department, New York University, Brooklyn, NY"]}},{"affiliation":"CSE Department, New York University, Brooklyn, NY","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086581933","id":37086581933,"full_name":"Cong Wang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["CSE Department, New York University, Brooklyn, NY"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Local histograms (i.e., point-wise histograms computed from local regions of mesh vertices) have been used in many data analysis and visualization applications.

We extend a ranking principal curve model to tune monotonic trends in attributes and present Imma Sort to sort items by multiple attributes simultaneously by trading-off the monotonicity in the primary sorted attribute to increase the human predictability for other attributes. We characterize how it performs for varying attribute correlations, attribute preferences, list lengths and number of attributes. We further extend Imma Sort with ImmaAnchor and ImmaCenter to improve the learnability and efficiency to search sorted items with conflicting attributes. We demonstrate usage scenarios for two applications and evaluate its learnability, usability, interpretability, and user performance in prediction and search tasks.
