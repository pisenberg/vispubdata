We present GraphDiaries, a visual interface designed to improve support for these tasks in any node-link based graph visualization system. GraphDiaries relies on animated transitions that highlight changes in the network between time steps, thus helping users identify and understand those changes. To better understand the tasks related to the exploration of dynamic networks, we first introduce a task taxonomy, that informs the design of GraphDiaries, presented afterwards. We then report on a user study, based on representative tasks identified through the taxonomy, and that compares GraphDiaries to existing techniques for temporal navigation in dynamic networks, showing that it outperforms them in terms of both task time and errors for several of these tasks.","article_number":"6658746","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6658746","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6658746/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6658746/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6774500,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"May 2014","start_page":"740","end_page":"754","citing_paper_count":131,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":1647,"insert_date":"20131108","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Layout","Animation","Taxonomy","Navigation","Topology","Complexity theory"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Dynamic networks","graph visualization","temporal navigation","user experiment"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Dynamic Network","Time Step","Visual System","User Study","Network Changes","Exploration Of Networks","Error Rate","Group Size","Target Group","Cognitive Load","Cognitive Demands","Mental Workload","Mental Effort","Types Of Changes","Visual Task","Visual Network","Network Diagram","Third Dimension","Number Of Time Steps","Static Network","Node Labels","Task Completion Time","Dynamic Graph","Node Removal","Interaction Techniques","High-level Tasks","Higher-level Tasks","Mental Maps","Arrow Keys","Graph Layout","Graph Drawing","Visual Encoding","Visual Representation","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Temporal Measures","Original Network"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.227","title":"Hierarchical Line Integration","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"8","issn":"2160-9306","rank":2,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Visualisierungsinstitut der Universität Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546168600","id":37546168600,"full_name":"Marcel Hlawatsch","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visualisierungsinstitut der Universität Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Visualisierungsinstitut der Universität Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282541900","id":37282541900,"full_name":"Filip Sadlo","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visualisierungsinstitut der Universität Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Visualisierungsinstitut der Universität Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268045000","id":37268045000,"full_name":"Daniel Weiskopf","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visualisierungsinstitut der Universität Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"This paper presents an acceleration scheme for the numerical computation of sets of trajectories in vector fields or iterated solutions in maps, possibly with simultaneous evaluation of quantities along the curves such as integrals or extrema. It addresses cases with a dense evaluation on the domain, where straightforward approaches are subject to redundant calculations. These are avoided by first calculating short solutions for the whole domain. From these, longer solutions are then constructed in a hierarchical manner until the designated length is achieved. While the computational complexity of the straightforward approach depends linearly on the length of the solutions, the computational cost with the proposed scheme grows only logarithmically with increasing length. Due to independence of subtasks and memory locality, our algorithm is suitable for parallel execution on many-core architectures like GPUs. The trade-offs of the method—lower accuracy and increased memory consumption—are analyzed, including error order as well as numerical error for discrete computation grids. The usefulness and flexibility of the scheme are demonstrated with two example applications: line integral convolution and the computation of the finite-time Lyapunov exponent. Finally, results and performance measurements of our GPU implementation are presented for both synthetic and simulated vector fields from computational fluid dynamics.","article_number":"5611509","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5611509","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5611509/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5611509/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5872084,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Aug. 2011","start_page":"1148","end_page":"1163","citing_paper_count":49,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":614,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Trajectory","Interpolation","Acceleration","Accuracy","Convolution","Visualization","Kernel"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Flow visualization","integral curves","hierarchical computation","FTLE","LIC","GPU."]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Line Integral","Logarithm","Log Transformed","Logarithmic Transformation","Computational Cost","Computational Complexity","Vector Field","Straightforward Approach","Memory Consumption","Parallel Execution","Acceleration Scheme","Acceleration Strategy","Synthetic Field","GPU Implementation","Time Step","Computation Time","Calculation Time","Step Size","Typical Example","Number Of Steps","3D Data","Levels Of Hierarchy","Calculation Steps","Computational Steps","Hierarchical Method","Hierarchical Strategy","Hierarchical Scheme","Time-dependent Data","Time Block","Setup Time","Pathlines","Filter Kernel","Surface Integrity","Solution Curve","Integral Curves","Open Domain","Integration Step","Zero Level"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2015.71","title":"Visualizing Personal Progress in Participatory Sports Cycling Events","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"4","issn":"1558-1756","rank":3,"volume":"35","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"City University, London","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399045100","id":37399045100,"full_name":"Jo Wood","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["City University, London"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Magazines","abstract":"This article explores the potential for creating personal visualization of participation in sports cycling as a design study.

In particular, they are often used to track critical points in time-dependent vector fields and to extract and track vortex core lines. The general idea is to extract the feature or its temporal evolution using a stream line integration in a derived vector field—the so-called Feature Flow Field (FFF). Hence, the desired feature line is a stream line of the FFF. As we will carefully analyze in this paper, the stream lines around this feature line may diverge from it. This creates an unstable situation: if the integration moves slightly off the feature line due to numerical errors, then it will be captured by the diverging neighborhood and carried away from the real feature line. The goal of this paper is to define a new FFF with the guarantee that the neighborhood of a feature line has always converging behavior. This way, we have an automatic correction of numerical errors: if the integration moves slightly off the feature line, it automatically moves back to it during the ongoing integration. This yields results which are an order of magnitude more accurate than the results from previous schemes. We present new stable FFF formulations for the main applications of tracking critical points and solving the Parallel Vectors operator. We apply our method to a number of data sets.","article_number":"5487517","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5487517","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5487517/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5487517/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5746558,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"June 2011","start_page":"770","end_page":"780","citing_paper_count":48,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":775,"insert_date":"20100617","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Field-flow fractionation","Feature extraction","Tensile stress","Data mining","Error correction","Bifurcation","Concrete","Computer errors"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Flow visualization","feature extraction."]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Streamline","Critical Point","Vector Field","Numerical Errors","Automatic Correction","Time-dependent Field","Parallel Vector","Step Size","Algebra","Second Derivative","Second-order Derivatives","Numerical Instability","Numerically Unstable","Numerous Instances","Adaptive Scheme","Feature Tracking","3D Field","Closed Curve","Integral Error","Topological Methods","Root-finding","Saddle-node Bifurcation","Fold Bifurcation","Poincaré Map","Poincaré Section","TU-Berlin","Technical University Of Berlin","Technische Universität Berlin"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.92","title":"Visualizing the Variability of Gradients in Uncertain 2D Scalar Fields","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"11","issn":"2160-9306","rank":5,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics and Visualization Group, Technische Universität München, Garching bei Munchen, Bavaria, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073865100","id":37073865100,"full_name":"Tobias Pfaffelmoser","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics and Visualization Group, Technische Universität München, Garching bei Munchen, Bavaria, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics and Visualization Group, Technische Universität München, Garching bei Munchen, Bavaria, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089046706","id":37089046706,"full_name":"Mihaela Mihai","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics and Visualization Group, Technische Universität München, Garching bei Munchen, Bavaria, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics and Visualization Group, Technische Universität München, Garching bei Munchen, Bavaria, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37444424000","id":37444424000,"full_name":"Rüdiger Westermann","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics and Visualization Group, Technische Universität München, Garching bei Munchen, Bavaria, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In uncertain scalar fields where data values vary with a certain probability, the strength of this variability indicates the confidence in the data. It does not, however, allow inferring on the effect of uncertainty on differential quantities such as the gradient, which depend on the variability of the rate of change of the data. Analyzing the variability of gradients is nonetheless more complicated, since, unlike scalars, gradients vary in both strength and direction. This requires initially the mathematical derivation of their respective value ranges, and then the development of effective analysis techniques for these ranges. This paper takes a first step into this direction: Based on the stochastic modeling of uncertainty via multivariate random variables, we start by deriving uncertainty parameters, such as the mean and the covariance matrix, for gradients in uncertain discrete scalar fields. We do not make any assumption about the distribution of the random variables. Then, for the first time to our best knowledge, we develop a mathematical framework for computing confidence intervals for both the gradient orientation and the strength of the derivative in any prescribed direction, for instance, the mean gradient direction. While this framework generalizes to 3D uncertain scalar fields, we concentrate on the visualization of the resulting intervals in 2D fields. We propose a novel color diffusion scheme to visualize both the absolute variability of the derivative strength and its magnitude relative to the mean values. A special family of circular glyphs is introduced to convey the uncertainty in gradient orientation. For a number of synthetic and real-world data sets, we demonstrate the use of our approach for analyzing the stability of certain features in uncertain 2D scalar fields, with respect to both local derivatives and feature orientation.","article_number":"6532277","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6532277","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6532277/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6532277/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6595509,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Nov. 2013","start_page":"1948","end_page":"1961","citing_paper_count":29,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":581,"insert_date":"20130614","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty","Standards","Vectors","Data visualization","Random variables","Probability density function","Image color analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty visualization","gradient variability","structural uncertainty","glyphs"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Confidence Interval","Random Variables","Covariance Matrix","Covariance Matrices","Stochastic Model","Parameter Uncertainty","Stable Characteristics","Stable Features","Stable Quality","Real-world Datasets","Effect Of Uncertainty","Gradient Direction","Calculate Confidence Intervals","Compute Confidence Intervals","Confidence Data","Mean Gradient","Gradient Orientation","Probability Density","Probability Density Function","High Uncertainty","Random Vector","Vector Field","Color Map","Relative Uncertainty","Absolute Uncertainty","White Band","Low Uncertainty","Gradient Magnitude","Black Band","Scalar Value","Use Of Color","Color Manipulation","Strong Uncertainty","Slope Stability","Slope Failure","Uncertain Data"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.109","title":"Topology Verification for Isosurface Extraction","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":6,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Computing and SCI Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37829389700","id":37829389700,"full_name":"Tiago Etiene","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computing and SCI Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Departamento de Matemática Aplicada e Estatística, Universidade de São Paulo, São Carlos, SP, Brazil","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590974800","id":37590974800,"full_name":"Luis Gustavo Nonato","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Departamento de Matemática Aplicada e Estatística, Universidade de São Paulo, São Carlos, SP, Brazil"]}},{"affiliation":"AT&T Labs—Research, Madison, NJ, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550809300","id":37550809300,"full_name":"Carlos Scheidegger","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["AT&T Labs—Research, Madison, NJ, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"TELECOM ParisTech, Paris, ÃŽle-de-France, FR","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087454751","id":37087454751,"full_name":"Julien Tienry","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TELECOM ParisTech, Paris, ÃŽle-de-France, FR"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Connecticut, Fairfield, Way, Storrs, CT, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564137100","id":37564137100,"full_name":"Thomas J.

In addition, the computational cost of various approaches is considered, and recommendations made about when to use each type of statistic.","article_number":"6197188","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6197188","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6197188/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6197188/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6376574,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Feb. 2013","start_page":"263","end_page":"277","citing_paper_count":18,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":811,"insert_date":"20120508","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Histograms","Size measurement","Jacobian matrices","Lattices","Quantization","Extraterrestrial measurements","Approximation methods"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Histograms","frequency distribution","integration","geometric statistics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Computational Cost","Regular Lattice","Cell Count","Slope Of Line","Integrable","Integrative Elements","Latent Space","Embedding Space","Supplementary Material Online","Set Of Cells","Homogeneous Cell","Cell Homogenates","Fractal Dimension","Activity Counts","Implicit Function","Implicitly Defined","Implicit Equation","Voronoi Diagram","Voronoi Tessellation","Voronoi Cell","Lebesgue Measure","Square Lattice","Visual Working","Preimage","Inverse Image","Lipschitz Function","Lipschitz Continuous Function","Delaunay Triangulation","Borel Set","Borel Σ-algebra","Borel Subset","Lebesgue Integrable","Open Ball","Contribution Of Cells","Measurement Theory","Inverse Gradient","Geometric Properties","Geometric Dimensions","Discrete Samples","Size Of Region","Least-squares Line","Geometric Theory"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2017.377152546","title":"ARIES: Enabling Visual Exploration and Organization of Art Image Collections","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"1558-1756","rank":9,"volume":"38","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Universidade Federal Fluminense","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086351395","id":37086351395,"full_name":"Lhaylla Crissaff","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universidade Federal Fluminense"]}},{"affiliation":"The Frick Art Reference Library","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087983359","id":37087983359,"full_name":"Louisa Wood Ruby","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The Frick Art Reference Library"]}},{"affiliation":"The Frick Art Reference Library","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086350260","id":37086350260,"full_name":"Samantha Deutch","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The Frick Art Reference Library"]}},{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085371523","id":37085371523,"full_name":"R.

On a light box, they can place slides or printed images, move the images around at will, group them as desired, and visual-ly compare them. The transition to digital images has rendered this workflow obsolete. Now, art historians lack well-designed, unified interactive software tools that effectively support the operations they perform with physi-cal light boxes. To address this problem, we designed ARIES (ARt Image Exploration Space), an interactive image manipulation system that enables the exploration and organization of fine digital art. The system allows images to be compared in multiple ways, offering dynamic overlays analogous to a physical light box, and sup-porting advanced image comparisons and feature-matching functions, available through computational image processing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system to support art historians tasks through real use cases.","article_number":"8059795","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8059795","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8059795/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8059795/","publication_title":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","publication_number":38,"is_number":8309983,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"Jan./Feb. 2018","start_page":"91","end_page":"108","citing_paper_count":13,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":706,"insert_date":"20171005","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Rendering (computer graphics)","Digital images","Space exploration"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["ARIES","museum","light box","art history","computer graphics","applications"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Image Collection","Photography","Digital Images","Etching","Interactive System","Works Of Art","Comparison Of Images","Comparable Image","Group Of Images","Large Number Of Images","Light Box","Professional Historians","Rectangular","Rectangle","Heatmap","Metadata","Relative Size","Workspace","Needs Assessment","Multiple Images","Visual Comparison","Chronological Order","Portion Of The Image","Help Of Images","Pinterest","Work In Progress","Work-in-progress","York Times Article","Microsoft PowerPoint","Microsoft Power Point","Microsoft Office PowerPoint","Single Environment"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2843369","title":"Visual Analytics in Deep Learning: An Interrogative Survey for the Next Frontiers","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"8","issn":"2160-9306","rank":10,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"College of Computing, Georgia Tech, Atlanta, Georgia, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086235240","id":37086235240,"full_name":"Fred Hohman","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Computing, Georgia Tech, Atlanta, Georgia, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Computing, Georgia Tech, Atlanta, Georgia, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085451248","id":37085451248,"full_name":"Minsuk Kahng","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Computing, Georgia Tech, Atlanta, Georgia, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Computing, Georgia Tech, Atlanta, Georgia, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085444131","id":37085444131,"full_name":"Robert Pienta","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Computing, Georgia Tech, Atlanta, Georgia, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Computing, Georgia Tech, Atlanta, Georgia, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38276339400","id":38276339400,"full_name":"Duen Horng Chau","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Computing, Georgia Tech, Atlanta, Georgia, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Deep learning has recently seen rapid development and received significant attention due to its state-of-the-art performance on previously-thought hard problems. However, because of the internal complexity and nonlinear structure of deep neural networks, the underlying decision making processes for why these models are achieving such performance are challenging and sometimes mystifying to interpret. As deep learning spreads across domains, it is of paramount importance that we equip users of deep learning with tools for understanding when a model works correctly, when it fails, and ultimately how to improve its performance. Standardized toolkits for building neural networks have helped democratize deep learning; visual analytics systems have now been developed to support model explanation, interpretation, debugging, and improvement. We present a survey of the role of visual analytics in deep learning research, which highlights its short yet impactful history and thoroughly summarizes the state-of-the-art using a human-centered interrogative framework, focusing on the Five W's and How (Why, Who, What, How, When, and Where). We conclude by highlighting research directions and open research problems. This survey helps researchers and practitioners in both visual analytics and deep learning to quickly learn key aspects of this young and rapidly growing body of research, whose impact spans a diverse range of domains.","article_number":"8371286","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8371286","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8371286/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8371286/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8750990,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"1 Aug. 2019","start_page":"2674","end_page":"2693","citing_paper_count":282,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":6494,"insert_date":"20180604","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Machine learning","Conferences","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Neural networks","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Deep learning","visual analytics","information visualization","neural networks"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Deep Learning","Visual Analysis","Neural Network","Deep Network","Deep Neural Network","Visual System","Debugging","Deep Learning Research","Machine Learning","Machine-learning","Convolutional Neural Network","Artificial Neural Network","Neural Network Model","Developed Model","Deep Models","Deep Learning Models","Neurons In Layer","Generative Adversarial Networks","Adversarial Learning","Visualization Techniques","Word Embedding","Word Vectors","Interactive Visualization","Data Instances","Instantaneous Data","Computational Graph","Visual Analytics Tool","Adversarial Examples","Time Epochs","Deep Research","Computer Vision Community","Artificial Intelligence Systems","Neural Machine Translation","Recurrent Neural Network","Common Terminology"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2359887","title":"Personal Visualization and Personal Visual Analytics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"2160-9306","rank":11,"volume":"21","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Victoria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085576024","id":37085576024,"full_name":"Dandan Huang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Victoria"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Victoria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275861300","id":37275861300,"full_name":"Melanie Tory","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Victoria"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085584897","id":37085584897,"full_name":"Bon Adriel Aseniero","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary"]}},{"affiliation":"Simon Fraser University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37353447100","id":37353447100,"full_name":"Lyn Bartram","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Simon Fraser University"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Prince Edward Island","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38091836700","id":38091836700,"full_name":"Scott Bateman","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Prince Edward Island"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37285000100","id":37285000100,"full_name":"Sheelagh Carpendale","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38569982800","id":38569982800,"full_name":"Anthony Tang","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary"]}},{"affiliation":"Simon Fraser University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38181028300","id":38181028300,"full_name":"Robert Woodbury","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Simon Fraser University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Data surrounds each and every one of us in our daily lives, ranging from exercise logs, to archives of our interactions with others on social media, to online resources pertaining to our hobbies.

Visualization (Vis) and visual analytics (VA) offer substantial opportunities to help individuals gain insights about themselves, their communities and their interests; however, designing tools to support data analysis in non-professional life brings a unique set of research and design challenges. We investigate the requirements and research directions required to take full advantage of Vis and VA in a personal context.

By identifying and exploring clusters in the design space, we discuss challenges and share perspectives on future research.

However, there has been a recent surge in popularity of consumer grade 3D displays and immersive head-mounted displays (HMDs). The ubiquity of such displays enables the possibility of immersive, stereoscopic visualization environments. While techniques that utilize such immersive environments have been explored extensively for spatial and scientific visualizations, contrastingly very little has been explored for information visualization. In this paper, we present our considerations of layout, rendering, and interaction methods for visualizing graphs in an immersive environment. We conducted a user study to evaluate our techniques compared to traditional 2D graph visualization. The results show that participants answered significantly faster with a fewer number of interactions using our techniques, especially for more difficult tasks. While the overall correctness rates are not significantly different, we found that participants gave significantly more correct answers using our techniques for larger graphs.","article_number":"7390081","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7390081","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7390081/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7390081/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7478694,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"1 July 2016","start_page":"1802","end_page":"1815","citing_paper_count":122,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":3751,"insert_date":"20160122","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Layout","Three-dimensional displays","Data visualization","Rendering (computer graphics)","Stereo image processing","Image edge detection","Two dimensional displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Graph visualization","virtual reality","immersive environments","head-mounted display","Graph visualization","virtual reality","immersive environments","head-mounted display"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visibility Graph","Visual Information","Difficult Task","User Study","Correct Rate","Correct Evaluation","Head-mounted Display","Immersive Environment","3D Display","Three-dimensional Display","3D Monitor","3D Screen","Traditional Graph","2D Graph","Scientific Visualization","Linear Interpolation","3D Space","3-dimensional Space","Euclidean Space","Greenhouse-Geisser Correction","Node Positions","Location Of Nodes","Visual Conditions","Visual Status","3D Visualization","Spherical Surface","Graph Size","Graph Layout","Graph Drawing","User Views","Task Completion Time","Stereographic Projection","Stereonet","Center Of The Sphere","Average Number Of Interactions","Spherical Space","Right Click","Left Click","View Direction","Narrow Field Of View"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2614803","title":"Timelines Revisited: A Design Space and Considerations for Expressive Storytelling","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"9","issn":"2160-9306","rank":13,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37719161300","id":37719161300,"full_name":"Matthew Brehmer","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37293389400","id":37293389400,"full_name":"Bongshin Lee","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard University, Cambridge, MA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085687578","id":37085687578,"full_name":"Benjamin Bach","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University, Cambridge, MA"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590950700","id":37590950700,"full_name":"Nathalie Henry Riche","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349490300","id":37349490300,"full_name":"Tamara Munzner","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"There are many ways to visualize event sequences as timelines.

Twenty combinations of these choices are viable timeline designs that can be matched to different narrative points, while smooth animated transitions between narrative points allow for the presentation of a cohesive story, an important aspect of both interactive storytelling and data videos. We further validate this design space by realizing the full set of viable timeline designs and transitions in a proof-of-concept sandbox implementation that we used to produce seven example timeline stories.

For studying the spatio-temporal patterns and trends of mass mobility, individual OD moves of many people are aggregated into flows (collective moves) by time intervals. Time-variant flow data pose two difficult challenges for visualization and analysis. First, flows may connect arbitrary locations (not only neighbors), thus making a graph with numerous edge intersections, which is hard to visualize in a comprehensible way. Even a single spatial situation consisting of flows in one time step is hard to explore. The second challenge is the need to analyze long time series consisting of numerous spatial situations. We present an approach facilitating exploration of long-term flow data by means of spatial and temporal abstraction. It involves a special way of data aggregation, which allows representing spatial situations by diagram maps instead of flow maps, thus reducing the intersections and occlusions pertaining to flow maps. The aggregated data are used for clustering of time intervals by similarity of the spatial situations. Temporal and spatial displays of the clustering results facilitate the discovery of periodic patterns and longer-term trends in the mass mobility behavior.","article_number":"7587808","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7587808","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7587808/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7587808/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7995103,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"1 Sept. 2017","start_page":"2120","end_page":"2136","citing_paper_count":88,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2892,"insert_date":"20161011","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Time series analysis","Market research","Data visualization","Complexity theory","Electronic mail","Visualization","Clutter"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Movement data","mobility behavior","spatial flow situation","flow map"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Social Mobility","Political Mobilization","Temporal Abstraction","Time Interval","Time Series","Spatial Patterns","Spatiotemporal Patterns","Temporal Patterns","End Time","Eschatological","Flow Data","Clustering Results","Flow Map","Mobility Behavior","Cluster Centers","Distance Range","Spatial Trends","Multiple Mapping","Range Direction","Round Trip","Incoming Flow","Spatial Aggregation","Small Flow","Magnitude Of Flow","Flow Situation","Origin-destination Pairs","Docking Station","Common Destination","Car Trips","Automobile Trips","Bicycle Use","Bike Use","Distance Classes","Comparison Of Modes","Angle Size","Individual Trips"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2549018","title":"A Systematic Review of Experimental Studies on Data Glyphs","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"7","issn":"2160-9306","rank":16,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38527541800","id":38527541800,"full_name":"Johannes Fuchs","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Inria, Paris, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591317800","id":37591317800,"full_name":"Petra Isenberg","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Inria, Paris, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Univ Paris Sud, CNRS & Inria, Paris, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267832500","id":37267832500,"full_name":"Anastasia Bezerianos","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Univ Paris Sud, CNRS & Inria, Paris, France"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","id":37283138700,"full_name":"Daniel Keim","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We systematically reviewed 64 user-study papers on data glyphs to help researchers and practitioners gain an informed understanding of tradeoffs in the glyph design space.

Over the past 60 years many different glyph designs were proposed and many of these designs have been subjected to perceptual or comparative evaluations. Yet, a systematic overview of the types of glyphs and design variations tested, the tasks under which they were analyzed, or even the study goals and results does not yet exist. In this paper we provide such an overview by systematically sampling and tabulating the literature on data glyph studies, listing their designs, questions, data, and tasks. In addition we present a concise overview of the types of glyphs and their design characteristics analyzed by researchers in the past, and a synthesis of the study results. Based on our meta analysis of all results we further contribute a set of design implications and a discussion on open research directions.","article_number":"7445239","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7445239","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7445239/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7445239/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7934157,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"1 July 2017","start_page":"1863","end_page":"1879","citing_paper_count":59,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1824,"insert_date":"20160331","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Data visualization","Systematics","Layout","Encoding","Guidelines"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Survey","glyphs","quantitative evaluation","glyph design"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Goal Of This Study","User Study","Open Research","Multidimensional Data","Multidimensional Analysis","Design Space","Quantitative Data","Quantitative Method","Quantitative Assessment","Quantitative Research","Quantitative Studies","Quantitative Approach","Metaphor","Small Number Of Studies","Dimensional Data","Cartographic","Number Of Data Points","Vast Majority Of Studies","Vast Majority Of These Studies","Monozygotic Twins","Identical Twins","Visual Search","Visual Scanning","Search Task","Treemap","Functional Tree","Performance Of Trees","Promising Research Direction","Visual Search Task","Linear Profile","Certain Point In Time","Grid Layout","Positional Encoding","Circular Profile","Common Baseline","Circular Layout","Types Of Tasks","Majority Of Studies","Majority Of These Studies","Bar Charts","Common Tasks","Design Guidelines"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2539960","title":"Coping with Volume and Variety in Temporal Event Sequences: Strategies for Sharpening Analytic Focus","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":17,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and the Human-Computer Interaction Lab, University of Maryland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085829363","id":37085829363,"full_name":"Fan Du","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and the Human-Computer Interaction Lab, University of Maryland"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and the Human-Computer Interaction Lab, University of Maryland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283016400","id":37283016400,"full_name":"Ben Shneiderman","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and the Human-Computer Interaction Lab, University of Maryland"]}},{"affiliation":"UMIACS and the Human-Computer Interaction Lab, University of Maryland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283026800","id":37283026800,"full_name":"Catherine Plaisant","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UMIACS and the Human-Computer Interaction Lab, University of Maryland"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and the Human-Computer Interaction Lab, University of Maryland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086060990","id":37086060990,"full_name":"Sana Malik","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and the Human-Computer Interaction Lab, University of Maryland"]}},{"affiliation":"IBM T.J.

Addressing these challenges is needed for big data to provide valuable insights and novel solutions for business, security, social media, and healthcare. In the case of temporal event sequence analytics it is the number of events in the data and variety of temporal sequence patterns that challenges users of visual analytic tools. This paper describes 15 strategies for sharpening analytic focus that analysts can use to reduce the data volume and pattern variety. Four groups of strategies are proposed: (1) extraction strategies, (2) temporal folding, (3) pattern simplification strategies, and (4) iterative strategies. For each strategy, we provide examples of the use and impact of this strategy on volume and/or variety. Examples are selected from 20 case studies gathered from either our own work, the literature, or based on email interviews with individuals who conducted the analyses and developers who observed analysts using the tools. Finally, we discuss how these strategies might be combined and report on the feedback from 10 senior event sequence analysts.","article_number":"7429778","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7429778","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429778/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429778/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7914798,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"1 June 2017","start_page":"1636","end_page":"1649","citing_paper_count":58,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1454,"insert_date":"20160309","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Focusing","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Pattern recognition","Sequences"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Big data","temporal data","temporal event sequences","workflow","visual analytics","visualization","analytic focus"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Sequence Of Events","Focus Of Analysis","Temporal Sequence","Temporal Sequence Of Events","Spatial Patterns","Spatiotemporal Patterns","Temporal Patterns","Patterns Of Variation","Volume Of Data","Intensity Data","Use Of Strategies","Analytical Tools","Event Data","Effective Data","Visual Analysis","Diverse Data","Variety Of Data","Visualization Tool","Iterative Scheme","Iterative Strategy","Extraction Strategy","Extraction Scheme","Email Interviews","Visual Analytics Tool","Reduction In The Number","Percentage Of Patients","Number Of Unique Sequences","Event Categories","Unique Sequences","List Of Strategies","Number Of Patterns","Detailed Case Studies","Goal Of Analysis","Instance Selection","Temporal Window"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2350494","title":"Visual Correlation Analysis of Numerical and Categorical Data on the Correlation Map","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":18,"volume":"21","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Visual Analytics and Imaging Lab at the Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38025124400","id":38025124400,"full_name":"Zhiyuan Zhang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Analytics and Imaging Lab at the Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Dowling College, Oakdale, NY","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37882660300","id":37882660300,"full_name":"Kevin T.

However, as the number of variables grows, it can be difficult to gain a good understanding of the correlation landscape and important intricate relationships might be missed. We previously introduced a technique that arranged the variables into a 2D layout, encoding their pairwise correlations. We then used this layout as a network for the interactive ordering of axes in parallel coordinate displays. Our current work expresses the layout as a correlation map and employs it for visual correlation analysis. In contrast to matrix displays where correlations are indicated at intersections of rows and columns, our map conveys correlations by spatial proximity which is more direct and more focused on the variables in play. We make the following new contributions, some unique to our map: (1) we devise mechanisms that handle both categorical and numerical variables within a unified framework, (2) we achieve scalability for large numbers of variables via a multi-scale semantic zooming approach, (3) we provide interactive techniques for exploring the impact of value bracketing on correlations, and (4) we visualize data relations within the sub-spaces spanned by correlated variables by projecting the data into a corresponding tessellation of the map.","article_number":"6881685","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6881685","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6881685/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6881685/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7000010,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"1 Feb. 2015","start_page":"289","end_page":"303","citing_paper_count":55,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2201,"insert_date":"20140821","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Correlation","Visualization","Layout","Data visualization","Correlation coefficient","Optimization","Numerical models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","visual correlation analysis","categorical data","information visualization","interactive interfaces"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Correlation Analysis","Numerical Data","Interactive","Correlated Variables","Numerical Variables","Parallel Coordinates","Regression Analysis","Pairing","Numerical Values","Class Level","Category Level","Random Assignment","Quasi-random","Correlation Strength","Data Space","Pairs Of Variables","Categories In Order","Classes In Order","Red Edge","File Type","Compression Algorithm","Least-squares Optimization","Visual Interface","Compression Level","US News","Subrange","Multiple Correspondence Analysis","Matrix Of Independent Variables","Independent Variable Matrices","Green Edges","Blue Box","Dependent Variable","Correspondence Analysis","Delaunay Triangulation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2610422","title":"A Survey on Visual Approaches for Analyzing Scientific Literature and Patents","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"9","issn":"2160-9306","rank":19,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Institute of Software Technology and Interactive Systems, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37569322900","id":37569322900,"full_name":"Paolo Federico","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Software Technology and Interactive Systems, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490630000","id":38490630000,"full_name":"Florian Heimerl","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593029700","id":37593029700,"full_name":"Steffen Koch","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Software Technology and Interactive Systems, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282584500","id":37282584500,"full_name":"Silvia Miksch","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Software Technology and Interactive Systems, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The increasingly large number of available writings describing technical and scientific progress, calls for advanced analytic tools for their efficient analysis.

In this survey, we review interactive analysis and visualization approaches of patents and scientific articles, ranging from exploration tools to sophisticated mining methods. In a bottom-up approach, we categorize them according to two aspects: (a) data type (text, citations, authors, metadata, and combinations thereof), and (b) task (finding and comparing single entities, seeking elementary relations, finding complex patterns, and in particular temporal patterns, and investigating connections between multiple behaviours).

With large scale data on mobility patterns, operators can move away from the costly, mostly survey based, transportation planning processes, to a more data-centric view, that places the instrumented user at the center of development. In this framework, using mobile phone data to perform transit analysis and optimization represents a new frontier with significant societal impact, especially in developing countries. In this paper we present AllAboard, an intelligent tool that analyses cellphone data to help city authorities in visually exploring urban mobility and optimizing public transport. This is performed within a self contained tool, as opposed to the current solutions which rely on a combination of several distinct tools for analysis, reporting, optimisation and planning. An interactive user interface allows transit operators to visually explore the travel demand in both space and time, correlate it with the transit network, and evaluate the quality of service that a transit network provides to the citizens at very fine grain. Operators can visually test scenarios for transit network improvements, and compare the expected impact on the travellers' experience. The system has been tested using real telecommunication data for the city of Abidjan, Ivory Coast, and evaluated from a data mining, optimisation and user prospective.","article_number":"7117451","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7117451","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7117451/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7117451/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7368227,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"1 Feb. 2016","start_page":"1036","end_page":"1050","citing_paper_count":53,"citing_patent_count":3,"download_count":1959,"insert_date":"20150603","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Optimization","Urban areas","Data mining","Mobile handsets","Planning","Visualization","Antennas"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Spatio-temporal mining","cellphone data","visual exploration","urban data mobility","transit network"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Public Transport","Mobile Data","Mobile Broadband","Visual Exploration","Time And Space","Spacetime","Mobile Phone","Service Quality","Mobility Patterns","Travel Behaviour","Travel Demand","Ivory Coast","Urban Mobility","Mobile Phone Data","Travel Time","Over Space","Hyperspace","Waiting Time","Key Performance Indicators","Public Network","Walking Time","Amount Of Flow","Flow Quantities","Circle Area","Flow Map","Bus Stop","Bus Routes","Antenna Pair","Pair Of Antennae","Public Transport Network","Cluttering","Bus Lines","Call Detail Records","Struct","Flow Set","Zoom Level","Density Of People"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2505305","title":"PeakVizor: Visual Analytics of Peaks in Video Clickstreams from Massive Open Online Courses","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"10","issn":"2160-9306","rank":21,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085471103","id":37085471103,"full_name":"Qing Chen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085871141","id":37085871141,"full_name":"Yuanzhe Chen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088559342","id":37088559342,"full_name":"Dongyu Liu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"IBM T.J.

To determine complex learning patterns in MOOC video interactions, this paper introduces a comprehensive visualization system called PeakVizor. This system enables course instructors and education experts to analyze the “peaks” or the video segments that generate numerous clickstreams. The system features three views at different levels: the overview with glyphs to display valuable statistics regarding the peaks detected; the flow view to present spatio-temporal information regarding the peaks; and the correlation view to show the correlation between different learner groups and the peaks. Case studies and interviews conducted with domain experts have demonstrated the usefulness and effectiveness of PeakVizor, and new findings about learning behaviors in MOOC platforms have been reported.","article_number":"7346501","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7346501","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7346501/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7346501/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7557097,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"1 Oct. 2016","start_page":"2315","end_page":"2330","citing_paper_count":50,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1720,"insert_date":"20151203","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visual analytics","Correlation","Electronic learning","Aggregates"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["MOOC","online education","visual analytics","clickstream data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Online Courses","Online Classes","Massive Open Online Courses","MOOCs","Open Online Courses","Massive Open Online","Visual System","Learning Behavior","Domain Experts","Group Learning","Peak Detection","Expert Teachers","Education Experts","Learning Patterns","Loyalty","End-users","Analysis Tasks","Interest In Learning","Video Content","Visual Design","Number Of Learners","Choropleth Maps","Parallel Coordinates","Intuitive Design","Peak Detection Algorithm","Peak Duration","Chinese Learners","Visual Encoding","Interview Summaries","Summary Of Each Interview","Pop-up Window"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2392771","title":"An Efficient Framework for Generating Storyline Visualizations from Streaming Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":22,"volume":"21","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"VIDI Research Group, University California, Davis, CA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37843956600","id":37843956600,"full_name":"Yuzuru Tanahashi","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VIDI Research Group, University California, Davis, CA"]}},{"affiliation":"VIDI Research Group, University California, Davis, CA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38236765200","id":38236765200,"full_name":"Chien-Hsin Hsueh","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VIDI Research Group, University California, Davis, CA"]}},{"affiliation":"VIDI Research Group, University California, Davis, CA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275869400","id":37275869400,"full_name":"Kwan-Liu Ma","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VIDI Research Group, University California, Davis, CA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"This paper presents a novel framework for applying storyline visualizations to streaming data.

In a spatial context, these summary displays have the drawback that when uncertainty is encoded via a spatial spread, display glyph area increases in size with prediction uncertainty. This increase can be easily confounded with an increase in the size, strength or other attribute of the phenomenon being presented. We argue that by directly displaying a carefully chosen subset of a prediction ensemble, so that uncertainty is conveyed implicitly, such misinterpretations can be avoided. Since such a display does not require uncertainty annotation, an information channel remains available for encoding additional information about the prediction. We demonstrate these points in the context of hurricane prediction visualizations, showing how we avoid occlusion of selected ensemble elements while preserving the spatial statistics of the original ensemble, and how an explicit encoding of uncertainty can also be constructed from such a selection. We conclude with the results of a cognitive experiment demonstrating that the approach can be used to construct storm prediction displays that significantly reduce the confounding of uncertainty with storm size, and thus improve viewers' ability to estimate potential for storm damage.","article_number":"7563342","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7563342","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7563342/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7563342/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7995103,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"1 Sept. 2017","start_page":"2165","end_page":"2178","citing_paper_count":48,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1895,"insert_date":"20160908","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty","Hurricanes","Storms","Data visualization","Visualization","Predictive models","Numerical models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Implicit uncertainty presentation","ensembles","ensemble visualization","sampling","uncertainty","hurricane prediction"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty Visualization","Prediction Uncertainty","Spatial Spread","Storm Damage","Uniform Distribution","Points In Space","Grid Cells","Subset Of Samples","Selection Algorithm","Radial Basis Function","Relaxation Process","Edge Length","Damage Rate","Evaluation Of Damage","Subset Selection","Ensemble Members","Representative Subset","Subset Of Instances","Inverse Mapping","Ensemble Prediction","Subset Of Points","Target Length","Warping Function","Full Ensemble","Interpolation Error","Type Of Visualization","Levels Of Hierarchy","Hierarchical Regression","Multilevel Analysis","Multilevel Models","Hierarchical Multiple Regression","Production Platform","Oil Platforms","Offshore Platforms","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Cells In Space","Relaxation Step"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2329308","title":"The Impact of Interactivity on Comprehending 2D and 3D Visualizations of Movement Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":24,"volume":"21","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37701811900","id":37701811900,"full_name":"Fereshteh Amini","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"École de technologie supérieure, Montreal, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077522300","id":37077522300,"full_name":"Sébastien Rufiange","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["École de technologie supérieure, Montreal, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37411412300","id":37411412300,"full_name":"Zahid Hossain","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"École de technologie supérieure, Montreal, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085523026","id":37085523026,"full_name":"Quentin Ventura","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["École de technologie supérieure, Montreal, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283481700","id":37283481700,"full_name":"Pourang Irani","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"École de technologie supérieure, Montreal, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38526446600","id":38526446600,"full_name":"Michael J.

Visualizing such spatio-temporal movement data is challenging because each person or object involves three variables (two spatial variables as a function of the time variable), and simply plotting the data on a 2D geographic map can result in overplotting and occlusion that hides details. This also makes it difficult to understand correlations between space and time. Software such as GeoTime can display such data with a three-dimensional visualization, where the 3rd dimension is used for time. This allows for the disambiguation of spatially overlapping trajectories, and in theory, should make the data clearer. However, previous experimental comparisons of 2D and 3D visualizations have so far found little advantage in 3D visualizations, possibly due to the increased complexity of navigating and understanding a 3D view. We present a new controlled experimental comparison of 2D and 3D visualizations, involving commonly performed tasks that have not been tested before, and find advantages in 3D visualizations for more complex tasks. In particular, we tease out the effects of various basic interactions and find that the 2D view relies significantly on “scrubbing” the timeline, whereas the 3D view relies mainly on 3D camera navigation. Our work helps to improve understanding of 2D and 3D visualizations of spatio-temporal data, particularly with respect to interactivity.","article_number":"6826569","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6826569","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6826569/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6826569/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6966852,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"1 Jan. 2015","start_page":"122","end_page":"135","citing_paper_count":48,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2147,"insert_date":"20140605","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Trajectory","Animation","Cameras","Mice","Visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Information visualization","spatio-temporal data","movement data","interactive visualization","evaluation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive","Data Visualization","3D Visualization","2D Visualization","Time And Space","Spacetime","Third Dimension","Spatiotemporal Data","2D Views","Error Rate","Time Interaction","Completion Time","Singular Value","Temporal Information","Types Of Questions","Ground Plane","Floor Plan","Domain Experts","Visualization Techniques","Time Axis","Complex Questions","3D Techniques","2D Techniques","Visual Style","Display Of Information","Effect Of Style","Positions Of Actors","Attitudes Of Actors","Text Labels","User Performance","3D Cube","Question Categories","Question Classification"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2331979","title":"An Approach to Supporting Incremental Visual Data Classification","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":25,"volume":"21","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Faculty of Computer Science, Federal University of Uberlandia-UFU, Uberlandia, Minas Gerais, Brazil","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38287494800","id":38287494800,"full_name":"Jose Gustavo S.

The approach is then well suited for incremental classification, present in many applications with evolving data sets. Data set visualization is accomplished by means of point placement strategies, and we exemplify the method through multidimensional projections and Neighbor Joining trees. The same methodology can be employed by a user who wishes to create his or her own ground truth (or perspective) from a previously unlabeled data set.

In this paper, we present a novel visualization technique called route-zooming that can embed spatio-temporal information into a map seamlessly for occlusion-free visualization of both spatial and temporal data. The proposed technique can broaden a selected route in a map by deforming the overall road network. We formulate the problem of route-zooming as a nonlinear least squares optimization problem by defining an energy function that ensures the route is broadened successfully on demand while the distortion caused to the road network is minimized. The spatio-temporal information can then be embedded into the route to reveal both spatial and temporal patterns without occluding the spatial context information. The route-zooming technique is applied in two instantiations including an interactive metro map for city tourism and illustrative maps to highlight information on the broadened roads to prove its applicability. We demonstrate the usability of our spatio-temporal visualization approach with case studies on real traffic flow data. We also study various design choices in our method, including the encoding of the time direction and choices of temporal display, and conduct a comprehensive user study to validate our embedded visualization design.","article_number":"7420745","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7420745","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7420745/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7420745/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7891682,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"1 May 2017","start_page":"1506","end_page":"1519","citing_paper_count":46,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1852,"insert_date":"20160226","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Roads","Data visualization","Context","Trajectory","Optimization","Spatial databases","Nonlinear distortion"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Spatio-temporal visualization","occlusion-free visualization","least-square optimization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Spatiotemporal Information","Interactive","Spatial Patterns","Spatiotemporal Patterns","Temporal Patterns","Optimization Problem","Spatial Information","Urban Planning","City Planning","Local Planning","User Study","Energy Function","Road Network","Street Network","Nonlinear Least Squares","Design Choices","Traffic Flow","Vehicular Traffic","Traffic Speed","Spatial Context","Temporal Data","Traffic Data","Spatiotemporal Data","Vehicle Trajectory","Least-squares Optimization","Horizontal Plane","Horizontal Direction","Horizontal Distance","Metro Line","Node Positions","Location Of Nodes","Road Segments","Street Segments","One-way Street","One-way Road","Number Of Buildings","Number Of Roads","Number Of Houses","Road Junctions","Street Junctions","Metro Station","Temporal Information","Bounding Box","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2315995","title":"How to Display Group Information on Node-Link Diagrams: An Evaluation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"11","issn":"2160-9306","rank":27,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Computing and Information Sciences, Florida International University, 11200 SW 8th Street, ECS354, Miami, FL","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37887934300","id":37887934300,"full_name":"Radu Jianu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computing and Information Sciences, Florida International University, 11200 SW 8th Street, ECS354, Miami, FL"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Rowan University, 201 Mullica Hill Road, Glassboro, NJ","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37287397400","id":37287397400,"full_name":"Adrian Rusu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Rowan University, 201 Mullica Hill Road, Glassboro, NJ"]}},{"affiliation":"AT&T Labs Research, 180 Park Ave., Florham Park, NJ","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403239700","id":37403239700,"full_name":"Yifan Hu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["AT&T Labs Research, 180 Park Ave., Florham Park, NJ"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Rowan University, 201 Mullica Hill Road, Glassboro, NJ","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37070619900","id":37070619900,"full_name":"Douglas Taggart","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Rowan University, 201 Mullica Hill Road, Glassboro, NJ"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present the results of evaluating four techniques for displaying group or cluster information overlaid on node-link diagrams: node coloring, GMap, BubbleSets, and LineSets. The contributions of the paper are three fold. First, we present quantitative results and statistical analyses of data from an online study in which approximately 800 subjects performed 10 types of group and network tasks in the four evaluated visualizations. Specifically, we show that BubbleSets is the best alternative for tasks involving group membership assessment; that visually encoding group information over basic node-link diagrams incurs an accuracy penalty of about 25 percent in solving network tasks; and that GMap's use of prominent group labels improves memorability. We also show that GMap's visual metaphor can be slightly altered to outperform BubbleSets in group membership assessment.

Many projection techniques have been recently proposed addressing different objectives and application domains. Nonetheless, very little is known about the effectiveness of the generated layouts from a user's perspective, how distinct layouts from the same data compare regarding the typical visualization tasks they support, or how domain-specific issues affect the outcome of the techniques. Learning more about projection usage is an important step towards both consolidating their role in high-dimensional data analysis and taking informed decisions when choosing techniques. This work provides a contribution towards this goal. We describe the results of an investigation on the performance of layouts generated by projection techniques as perceived by their users. We conducted a controlled user study to test against the following hypotheses: (1) projection performance is task-dependent; (2) certain projections perform better on certain types of tasks; (3) projection performance depends on the nature of the data; and (4) subjects prefer projections with good segregation capability. We generated layouts of high-dimensional data with five techniques representative of different projection approaches. As application domains we investigated image and document data. We identified eight typical tasks, three of them related to segregation capability of the projection, three related to projection precision, and two related to incurred visual cluttering. Answers to questions were compared for correctness against `ground truth' computed directly from the data. We also looked at subject confidence and task completion times. Statistical analysis of the collected data resulted in Hypotheses 1 and 3 being confirmed, Hypothesis 2 being confirmed partially and Hypotheses 4 could not be confirmed. We discuss our findings in comparison with some numerical measures of projection layout quality. Our results offer interesting insight on the use of projection layouts in data visualization tasks and provide a departing point for further systematic investigations.","article_number":"6832613","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6832613","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6832613/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6832613/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6966852,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"1 Jan. 2015","start_page":"81","end_page":"94","citing_paper_count":44,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2289,"insert_date":"20140612","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Layout","Data visualization","Image color analysis","Visualization","Principal component analysis","Extraterrestrial measurements"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Projections","dimension reduction","multidimensional data","perception-based evaluation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Visualization","Multidimensional Data","Multidimensional Analysis","Projection Method","Quality Measures","Dimensionality Reduction","User Study","Types Of Tasks","Applicability Domain","Numerous Measures","Project Performance","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Subjective Confidence","Cluttering","Pairwise Comparisons","Imaging Data","Characteristics Of Data","Features Of Data","Scatter Plot","Image Dataset","Subclusters","Friedman Test","Original Space","Study Setup","Significant Pairwise Differences","Task Group","Medical Datasets","Expert Users","Multidimensional Datasets","Real-world Datasets","Silhouette Value","Silhouette Coefficient"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2413786","title":"Learning Visualizations by Analogy: Promoting Visual Literacy through Visualization Morphing","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"9","issn":"2160-9306","rank":29,"volume":"21","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Chulalongkorn Business School, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077393400","id":37077393400,"full_name":"Puripant Ruchikachorn","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Chulalongkorn Business School, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand","Visual Analytics and Imaging Laboratory, Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY"]}},{"affiliation":"Visual Analytics and Imaging Laboratory, Department of Computer Science","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273119700","id":37273119700,"full_name":"Klaus Mueller","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Analytics and Imaging Laboratory, Department of Computer Science","Stony Brook University, SUNY Korea, Incheon, NY, Korea"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We propose the concept of teaching (and learning) unfamiliar visualizations by analogy, that is, demonstrating an unfamiliar visualization method by linking it to another more familiar one, where the in-betweens are designed to bridge the gap of these two visualizations and explain the difference in a gradual manner.

We demonstrate our idea by ways of four visualization pair examples: data table and parallel coordinates, scatterplot matrix and hyperbox, linear chart and spiral chart, and hierarchical pie chart and treemap. The analogy is commutative i.e. any member of the pair can be the unfamiliar visualization. A series of studies showed that this new paradigm can be an effective teaching tool. The participants could understand the unfamiliar visualization methods in all of the four pairs either fully or at least significantly better after they observed or interacted with the transitions from the familiar counterpart. The four examples suggest how helpful visualization pairings be identified and they will hopefully inspire other visualization morphings and associated transition strategies to be identified.","article_number":"7061477","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7061477","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7061477/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7061477/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7169658,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"1 Sept. 2015","start_page":"1028","end_page":"1044","citing_paper_count":43,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1923,"insert_date":"20150316","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Animation","Education","Joining processes","Spirals","Layout"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Animation","Education","Information Visualization","Literacy","Interaction","Multivariate Visualization","Animation","education","information visualization","literacy","interaction","multivariate visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Literacy","Pairing","Visual Methods","Textual Descriptions","Pie Chart","Treemap","Functional Tree","Performance Of Trees","Parallel Coordinates","Scatterplot Matrix","Scatterplot Matrices","Time Series","Data Visualization","Visual Information","Horizontal Axis","Series Of Images","Serial Imaging","Linear Interpolation","Bar Charts","Axis Parallel","Axial Orientation","Axis-aligned","Row Of Table","Interactive Visualization","Visual Understanding","Series Of Pictures","Line Chart","Mixed Configuration","Visual Elements","Polyline","Hierarchical Data","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Layout Changes","Visualization Techniques"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.2297914","title":"Blood Flow Clustering and Applications inVirtual Stenting of Intracranial Aneurysms","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"5","issn":"2160-9306","rank":30,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Simulation and Graphics, University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37424645600","id":37424645600,"full_name":"Steffen Oeltze","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Simulation and Graphics, University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Simulation and Graphics, University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601992200","id":37601992200,"full_name":"Dirk J.

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of blood flow based on patient-individual data are performed to better understand aneurysm initiation and progression and more recently, for predicting treatment success. In virtual stenting, a flow-diverting mesh tube (stent) is modeled inside the reconstructed vasculature and integrated in the simulation. We focus on steady-state simulation and the resulting complex multiparameter data. The blood flow pattern captured therein is assumed to be related to the success of stenting. It is often visualized by a dense and cluttered set of streamlines.We present a fully automatic approach for reducing visual clutter and exposing characteristic flow structures by clustering streamlines and computing cluster representatives. While individual clustering techniques have been applied before to streamlines in 3D flow fields, we contribute a general quantitative and a domain-specific qualitative evaluation of three state-of-the-art techniques. We show that clustering based on streamline geometry as well as on domain-specific streamline attributes contributes to comparing and evaluating different virtual stenting strategies.

To summarize a given dataset, Keshif aggregates records by value within attribute summaries, and visualizes aggregate characteristics using a consistent design based on data types. To reveal data distribution details, Keshif features three complementary linked selections: highlighting, filtering, and comparison. Keshif further increases expressiveness through aggregate metrics, absolute/part-of scale modes, calculated attributes, and saved selections, all working in synchrony. Its automated design approach also simplifies authoring of dashboards composed of summaries and individual records from raw data using fluid interaction.

Low-dimensional representations of the data help, for instance, to explore the class separability and the spatial distribution of the data. Widely-used unsupervised DR methods like PCA do not aim to maximize the class separation, while supervised DR methods like LDA often assume certain spatial distributions and do not take perceptual capabilities of humans into account. These issues make them ineffective for complicated class structures. Towards filling this gap, we present a perception-driven linear dimensionality reduction approach that maximizes the perceived class separation in projections. Our approach builds on recent developments in perception-based separation measures that have achieved good results in imitating human perception. We extend these measures to be density-aware and incorporate them into a customized simulated annealing algorithm, which can rapidly generate a near optimal DR projection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing it to state-of-the-art DR methods on 93 datasets, using both quantitative measure and human judgments. We also provide case studies with class-imbalanced and unlabeled data.","article_number":"7920403","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7920403","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7920403/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7920403/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8326693,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"1 May 2018","start_page":"1828","end_page":"1840","citing_paper_count":40,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1594,"insert_date":"20170505","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Principal component analysis","Data visualization","Density measurement","Simulated annealing","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Dimensionality reduction","supervised","visual class separation","high-dimensional data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Dimensionality Reduction","Linear Discriminant Analysis","Discriminant Function","Discriminant Function Analysis","Class Structure","Unsupervised Methods","Unsupervised Method","Simulated Annealing","Separate Measurements","Class Separation","Unlabeled Data","Dimensionality Reduction Methods","Dimensionality Reduction Method","Linear Reduction","Dimensionality Reduction Approach","Linear Dimensionality Reduction","Objective Function","Scatter Plot","Local Structure","Linear Method","Linear Methods","Time Complexity","Class Labels","Local Optimum","Nonlinear Method","Nonlinear Methods","Maximum Separation","Class Center","Nearest Point","Degree Of Separation","Random Projection","Krippendorff’s Alpha","Nearest Center","Class Boundaries","Silhouette Coefficient","Random Initialization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2666146","title":"Data Flow Analysis and Visualization for Spatiotemporal Statistical Data without Trajectory Information","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"2160-9306","rank":34,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086291897","id":37086291897,"full_name":"Seokyeon Kim","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086284892","id":37086284892,"full_name":"Seongmin Jeong","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Intel Folsom, Folsom, CA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38517641200","id":38517641200,"full_name":"Insoo Woo","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Intel Folsom, Folsom, CA"]}},{"affiliation":"Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37557344300","id":37557344300,"full_name":"Yun Jang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396008400","id":37396008400,"full_name":"Ross Maciejewski","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282598900","id":37282598900,"full_name":"David S.

The goal of those techniques is to enable users to explore events and interactions over space and time in order to facilitate the discovery of patterns, anomalies and relationships within the data. However, it is difficult to extract and visualize data flow patterns over time for non-directional statistical data without trajectory information. In this work, we develop a novel flow analysis technique to extract, represent, and analyze flow maps of non-directional spatiotemporal data unaccompanied by trajectory information. We estimate a continuous distribution of these events over space and time, and extract flow fields for spatial and temporal changes utilizing a gravity model. Then, we visualize the spatiotemporal patterns in the data by employing flow visualization techniques. The user is presented with temporal trends of geo-referenced discrete events on a map. As such, overall spatiotemporal data flow patterns help users analyze geo-referenced temporal events, such as disease outbreaks, crime patterns, etc. To validate our model, we discard the trajectory information in an origin-destination dataset and apply our technique to the data and compare the derived trajectories and the original. Finally, we present spatiotemporal trend analysis for statistical datasets including twitter data, maritime search and rescue events, and syndromic surveillance.","article_number":"7847429","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7847429","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7847429/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7847429/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8272049,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"1 March 2018","start_page":"1287","end_page":"1300","citing_paper_count":40,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":3167,"insert_date":"20170208","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Gravity","Trajectory","Data mining","Market research","Heating"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Spatiotemporal data visualization","kernel density estimation","flow map","gravity model"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Visualization","Flow Data","Flow Analysis","Spatiotemporal Data","Flow Visualization","Trajectory Information","Data-flow Analysis","Data Flow Analysis","Spatial Patterns","Spatiotemporal Patterns","Temporal Patterns","Flow Patterns","Public Health Surveillance","Syndromic Surveillance","Clinical Surveillance","Over Space","Hyperspace","Visualization Techniques","Spatiotemporal Analysis","Gravity Model","Twitter Data","Flow Map","Analysis System","Heatmap","Data Distribution","Time Step","Discrete Data","Discrete Structures","Discrete Units","Vector Field","Spatiotemporal Effects","Spatiotemporal Events","Representation Of Function","High-density Areas","Potential Flow","Web-based Visualization","Visual System","Cartographic","Direct Information"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2511718","title":"The Elicitation Interview Technique: Capturing People's Experiences of Data Representations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":35,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Crawford College of Art and Design, Cork Institute of Technology, Cork, Ireland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085878223","id":37085878223,"full_name":"Trevor Hogan","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Crawford College of Art and Design, Cork Institute of Technology, Cork, Ireland"]}},{"affiliation":"SACHI Group, School of Computer Science, University of St Andrews, Fife, United Kingdom","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869968000","id":37869968000,"full_name":"Uta Hinrichs","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SACHI Group, School of Computer Science, University of St Andrews, Fife, United Kingdom"]}},{"affiliation":"Faculty of Media, Bauhaus-Universität Weimar, Weimar, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37870092400","id":37870092400,"full_name":"Eva Hornecker","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Faculty of Media, Bauhaus-Universität Weimar, Weimar, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Information visualization has become a popular tool to facilitate sense-making, discovery and communication in a large range of professional and casual contexts.

We argue that it can be applied to help understand how people experience and interpret visualizations as part of exploration and data analysis processes. We describe the key characteristics of this interview technique and present a study we conducted to exemplify how it can be applied to evaluate data representations. Our study illustrates the types of insights this technique can bring to the fore, for example, evidence for deep interpretation of visual representations and the formation of interpretations and stories beyond the represented data.

The effectiveness of this approach depends on how the visual variables chosen for representing uncertainty and other attributes interact to influence the user's perception of each variable. We report a user study on the perception of graph edge attributes when uncertainty associated with each edge and the main edge attribute are visualized simultaneously using two separate visual variables. The study covers four visual variables that are commonly used for visualizing uncertainty on line graphical primitives: lightness, grain, fuzziness, and transparency. We select width, hue, and saturation for visualizing the main edge attribute and hypothesize that we can observe interference between the visual variable chosen to encode the main edge attribute and that to encode uncertainty, as suggested by the concept of dimensional integrality. Grouping the seven visual variables as color-based, focus-based, or geometry-based, we further hypothesize that the degree of interference is affected by the groups to which the two visual variables belong. We consider two further factors in the study: discriminability level for each visual variable as a factor intrinsic to the visual variables and graph-task type (visual search versus comparison) as a factor extrinsic to the visual variables. Our results show that the effectiveness of a visual variable in depicting uncertainty is strongly mediated by all the factors examined here. Focus-based visual variables (fuzziness, grain, and transparency) are robust to the choice of visual variables for encoding the main edge attribute, though fuzziness has stronger negative impact on the perception of width and transparency has stronger negative impact on the perception of hue than the other uncertainty visual variables. We found that interference between hue and lightness is much greater than that between saturation and lightness, though all three are color-based visual variables. We also found a compound relationship between discriminability level and the degree of dimensional integrality. We discuss the generalizability and limitation of the results and conclude with design considerations for visualizing graph uncertainty derived from these results, including recommended choices of visual variables when the relative importance of data attributes and graph tasks is known.","article_number":"7089294","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7089294","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7089294/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7089294/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7230337,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"1 Oct. 2015","start_page":"1173","end_page":"1186","citing_paper_count":38,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1326,"insert_date":"20150420","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Uncertainty","Encoding","Data visualization","Image color analysis","Accuracy","Interference"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual variable","perception","uncertainty visualization","graph visualization","Visual variable","perception","uncertainty visualization","graph visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Search","Visual Scanning","Strong Negative Impact","Degree Of Interference","Edge Attributes","Edge Properties","Types Of Tasks","Visual Task","Target Type","Pairs Of Variables","Positive Stimuli","Positive Stimulus","Visibility Graph","High Discrimination","Visual Search Task","Middle Value","Low Discrimination","Effect Of Curvature","Comparison Task","Repeat Trials","Repetition Trials","HSV Color","HSV Color Space","Hue, Saturation, Value","Hue-saturation-value","Color Hue","Edge Strength","Discrete Uniform Distribution","Significant Decrease In Accuracy","Cross Mark","Circle Markers","Visual Properties","Visual Attributes","Consecutive Levels","Target Value","Discriminant Effect","Interaction Effect","Latin Square"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2653106","title":"Line Graph or Scatter Plot?

We also describe misinterpretations of connected scatterplots and propose further research into mitigating these mistakes for viewers unfamiliar with the technique.","article_number":"7332976","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7332976","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7332976/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7332976/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7524660,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"1 Sept. 2016","start_page":"2174","end_page":"2186","citing_paper_count":34,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1238,"insert_date":"20151120","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Time series analysis","Data visualization","Media","Unemployment","Shape","Frequency measurement"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Time Series","News Media","Traditional Forms","College Students","University Students","Horizontal Axis","Journalism","Differences In Use","Visual Features","Visual Characteristics","Line Segment","Flow Time","Consecutive Points","Lack Of Familiarity","Line Chart","Horizontal Meridian","Half Of The Experiment","Halves Of The Experiment","Highlighted Regions","Number Of Troops","Number Of Military Personnel","Unusual Shape","Chart Types","Shape Of The Graph"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2413774","title":"Bridging Theory with Practice: An Exploratory Study of Visualization Use and Design for Climate Model Comparison","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"9","issn":"2160-9306","rank":41,"volume":"21","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"DataONE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593202500","id":37593202500,"full_name":"Aritra Dasgupta","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["DataONE","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, New York University, New York City, NY"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, New York University, Brooklyn, NY","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38548192600","id":38548192600,"full_name":"Jorge Poco","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, New York University, Brooklyn, NY"]}},{"affiliation":"Environmental Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Knoxville, TN","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38184496400","id":38184496400,"full_name":"Yaxing Wei","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Environmental Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Knoxville, TN"]}},{"affiliation":"Environmental Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Knoxville, TN","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37669205100","id":37669205100,"full_name":"Robert Cook","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Environmental Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Knoxville, TN"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, New York University, Brooklyn, NY","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38267713800","id":38267713800,"full_name":"Enrico Bertini","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, New York University, Brooklyn, NY"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, New York University, Brooklyn, NY","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275249200","id":37275249200,"full_name":"Cláudio T.

While this is important in determining the effectiveness of the tools and advancing the state-of-the-art in visualization research, a key area that has mostly been overlooked is how well established visualization theories and principles are instantiated in practice. This is especially relevant when domain experts, and not visualization researchers, design visualizations for analysis of their data or for broader dissemination of scientific knowledge. There is very little research on exploring the synergistic capabilities of cross-domain collaboration between domain experts and visualization researchers. To fill this gap, in this paper we describe the results of an exploratory study of climate data visualizations conducted in tight collaboration with a pool of climate scientists. The study analyzes a large set of static climate data visualizations for identifying their shortcomings in terms of visualization design. The outcome of the study is a classification scheme that categorizes the design problems in the form of a descriptive taxonomy. The taxonomy is a first attempt for systematically categorizing the types, causes, and consequences of design problems in visualizations created by domain experts. We demonstrate the use of the taxonomy for a number of purposes, such as, improving the existing climate data visualizations, reflecting on the impact of the problems for enabling domain experts in designing better visualizations, and also learning about the gaps and opportunities for future visualization research. We demonstrate the applicability of our taxonomy through a number of examples and discuss the lessons learnt and implications of our findings.","article_number":"7061479","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7061479","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7061479/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7061479/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7169658,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"1 Sept. 2015","start_page":"996","end_page":"1014","citing_paper_count":34,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1496,"insert_date":"20150316","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Meteorology","Visualization","Taxonomy","Biological system modeling","Encoding","Data models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["visualization","design principles","climate model","taxonomy","Visualization","design principles","climate model","taxonomy"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Model Comparison","Climate Models","Climate Simulations","Visual Design","Climatological","Climate Research","Climate Science","Design Problem","Vision Research","Domain Experts","Effects Of Problems","Problematic Consequences","Best Practices","Rational Design","Design Principles","Scatter Plot","Visual Representation","Color Map","Visual Search","Visual Scanning","Visual Map","Cause Of Problems","Visual Problems","Multiple Mapping","Use Of Color","Color Manipulation","Line Chart","Lack Of Emphasis","Chart Types","Color Mixing","Qualitative Mapping","Data Distortion","Use Of Plots","Terrestrial Models","Loss Aversion","Similar Model"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2016.101","title":"StatCast Dashboard: Exploration of Spatiotemporal Baseball Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"5","issn":"1558-1756","rank":42,"volume":"36","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Universidade Federal Fluminense","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37721747800","id":37721747800,"full_name":"Marcos Lage","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universidade Federal Fluminense"]}},{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085831490","id":37085831490,"full_name":"Jorge Piazentin Ono","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University"]}},{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085831008","id":37085831008,"full_name":"Daniel Cervone","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University"]}},{"affiliation":"Collegiate School","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085831309","id":37085831309,"full_name":"Justin Chiang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Collegiate School"]}},{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37867422200","id":37867422200,"full_name":"Carlos Dietrich","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University"]}},{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275249200","id":37275249200,"full_name":"Claudio T.

The visual representation of ThemeDelta uses sinuous, variable-width lines to show this evolution on a timeline, utilizing color for categories, and line width for keyword strength. We demonstrate how interaction with ThemeDelta helps capture the rise and fall of topics by analyzing archives of historical newspapers, of U.S. presidential campaign speeches, and of social messages collected through iNeighbors, a web-based social website.

Incremental visualization approaches are a means to address this challenge, as they permit the user to interact with, steer, and change the visualization at intermediate time points and not just after it has been completed. In this paper, we put forward a model for incremental visualizations that is based on the established Data State Reference Model, but extends it in ways to also represent partitioned data and visualization operators to facilitate intermediate visualization updates. In combination, partitioned data and operators can be used independently and in combination to strike tailored compromises between output quality, shown data quantity, and responsiveness-i.e., frame rates. We showcase the new expressive power of this model by discussing the opportunities and challenges of incremental visualization in general and its usage in a real world scenario in particular.","article_number":"7172541","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7172541","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7172541/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7172541/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7478694,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"1 July 2016","start_page":"1830","end_page":"1842","citing_paper_count":30,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1797,"insert_date":"20150729","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Data models","Pipelines","Visualization","Electronic mail","Geometry","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization pipeline","data state reference model","progressive visualization","proactive visualization","Visualization pipeline","data state reference model","progressive visualization","proactive visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Processing","Frame Rate","Yield Quality","Output Quality","Yield Characteristics","Matter Of Course","Intermediate Time Points","Technical Possibilities","Interactive","Processing Steps","Nonlinear Function","Nonlinear Mapping","Parametrized","Number Of Markers","Density Map","Partial Data","Data Streams","Intermediate Results","Intermediate Outcomes","Quality Metrics","Income Data","User Interest","Delta Values","Incremental Process","Data Chunks","Chunk Size","Frames Per Second","Small Chunks","Geometry Data","Incremental Model","User Goals","Iterative Refinement","Break Condition","Disruption Condition","Principal Ways"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2515611","title":"CUBu: Universal Real-Time Bundling for Large Graphs","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":46,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Groningen, The Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085682627","id":37085682627,"full_name":"Matthew van der Zwan","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Groningen, The Netherlands"]}},{"affiliation":"SURFsara, Amsterdam, The Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37992881100","id":37992881100,"full_name":"Valeriu Codreanu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SURFsara, Amsterdam, The Netherlands"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Groningen, The Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268047100","id":37268047100,"full_name":"Alexandru Telea","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Groningen, The Netherlands"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Visualizing very large graphs by edge bundling is a promising method, yet subject to several challenges: speed, clutter, level-of-detail, and parameter control.

RCLens adopts a novel active learning-based algorithm to iteratively identify more accurate rare categories in response to user-provided feedback. The algorithm is tightly integrated with an interactive visualization-based interface which supports a novel and effective workflow for rare category identification. This paper (1) defines RCLens’ underlying active-learning algorithm; (2) describes the visualization and interaction designs, including a discussion of how the designs support user-guided rare category identification; and (3) presents results from an evaluation demonstrating RCLens’ ability to support the rare category identification process.","article_number":"7939996","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7939996","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7939996/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7939996/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8365860,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"1 July 2018","start_page":"2223","end_page":"2237","citing_paper_count":27,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":972,"insert_date":"20170606","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Algorithm design and analysis","Data visualization","Visualization","Prototypes","Detection algorithms"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","information visualization","rare category detection","machine learning"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive","Rare Categories","Active Learning","Rare Entity","Visual Design","Feature Values","Characteristic Values","Feature Space","Exploratory Data","Precision And Recall","Bar Charts","Anomaly Detection","Outlier Detection","Data Instances","Instantaneous Data","Types Of Connections","Nearest Neighbor Search","Nearest Neighbor Method","Nearest Neighbour Method","Size Categories","Random Guessing","Search Range","Expert Users","List Of Categories","Parallel Coordinates","Percentage Of Instances","Unlabeled Instances","Active Learning Techniques","Average Of Recall","High Recall","Feature Subspace","Data Distribution"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2785271","title":"KAVAGait: Knowledge-Assisted Visual Analytics for Clinical Gait Analysis","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"2160-9306","rank":48,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"TU Wien, Wien, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085865698","id":37085865698,"full_name":"Markus Wagner","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Wien, Wien, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Wien, Wien, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086428866","id":37086428866,"full_name":"Djordje Slijepcevic","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Wien, Wien, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"St. Pölten University of Applied Sciences, St. Pölten, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086432974","id":37086432974,"full_name":"Brian Horsak","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["St. Pölten University of Applied Sciences, St. Pölten, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Wien, Wien, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077207200","id":37077207200,"full_name":"Alexander Rind","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Wien, Wien, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Wien, Wien, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38054981200","id":38054981200,"full_name":"Matthias Zeppelzauer","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Wien, Wien, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Wien, Wien, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267339500","id":37267339500,"full_name":"Wolfgang Aigner","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Wien, Wien, Austria"]}}]},"access_type":"CCBY - IEEE is not the copyright holder of this material.

Thus, gait rehabilitation is a crucial part of health care systems. The quantification of human locomotion enables clinicians to describe and analyze a patient's gait performance in detail and allows them to base clinical decisions on objective data. These assessments generate a vast amount of complex data which need to be interpreted in a short time period. We conducted a design study in cooperation with gait analysis experts to develop a novel Knowledge-Assisted Visual Analytics solution for clinical Gait analysis (KAVAGait). KAVAGait allows the clinician to store and inspect complex data derived during clinical gait analysis. The system incorporates innovative and interactive visual interface concepts, which were developed based on the needs of clinicians. Additionally, an explicit knowledge store (EKS) allows externalization and storage of implicit knowledge from clinicians. It makes this information available for others, supporting the process of data inspection and clinical decision making. We validated our system by conducting expert reviews, a user study, and a case study. Results suggest that KAVAGait is able to support a clinician during clinical practice by visualizing complex gait data and providing knowledge of other clinicians.","article_number":"8304678","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8304678","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8304678/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8304678/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8629338,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"1 March 2019","start_page":"1528","end_page":"1542","citing_paper_count":27,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2526,"insert_date":"20180228","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visual analytics","Time series analysis","Decision making","Tools","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Design study","interface design","knowledge generation","knowledge-assisted","visualization","visual analytics","gait analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Gait Analysis","Clinical Gait Analysis","Clinical Practice","Interactive","User Study","Tacit Knowledge","Implicit Knowledge","Embodied Knowledge","Expert Review","Explicit Knowledge","Gait Training","Gait Rehabilitation","Gait Data","Visual Concepts","Patient Data","Focus Group","Classification Of Patients","Categories Of Patients","Multivariate Data","Multivariate Statistics","Analysis Tasks","Domain Experts","Vertical Component","Force Plate","Force Platform","Ground Reaction Force","Visual Metaphors","Visual Design","Discrete Parameters","Graphical Summary","Gait Pattern","National Experts","Multivariate Time Series","Multivariate Time-series","Univariate Time Series","Left Foot","Left Feet","Focus Group Meetings"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2642109","title":"Evaluating Cartogram Effectiveness","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":49,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38342290200","id":38342290200,"full_name":"Sabrina Nusrat","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Irvine, CA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086282990","id":37086282990,"full_name":"Md.

Despite the popularity of cartograms, and the large number of cartogram types, there are few studies evaluating the effectiveness of cartograms in conveying information. Based on a recent task taxonomy for cartograms, we evaluate four major types of cartograms: contiguous, non-contiguous, rectangular, and Dorling cartograms. We first evaluate the effectiveness of these cartogram types by quantitative performance analysis (time and error). Second, we collect qualitative data with an attitude study and by analyzing subjective preferences. Third, we compare the quantitative and qualitative results with the results of a metrics-based cartogram evaluation. Fourth, we analyze the results of our study in the context of cartography, geography, visual perception, and demography. Finally, we consider implications for design and possible improvements.","article_number":"7792176","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7792176","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7792176/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7792176/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8241790,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"1 Feb. 2018","start_page":"1077","end_page":"1090","citing_paper_count":27,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1221,"insert_date":"20161220","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Shape","Sociology","Statistics","Voting","Topology","Data visualization","Geography"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Cartograms","geo-visualization","subjective evaluation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Rectangular","Rectangle","Subjective Preferences","Error Rate","Differences In Performance","Female Participants","Bimodal","Bimodal Distribution","Male Participants","Support For Hypothesis","Change Detection","Completion Time","Visual Task","Effects Of Different Types","Different Types Of Events","Original Shape","Election Results","Electoral Outcomes","Thematic Map","Hamming Distance","Word Pairs","Original Map","Types Of Maps","Partial Evidence","Choropleth Maps","Adjacency Relationship","Regional Mapping","Kinds Of Tasks","Exact Question","Similar Mean","Null Hypothesis","Task Group","Time Difference"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2325043","title":"Interpolation-Based Pathline Tracing in Particle-Based Flow Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":50,"volume":"21","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Institute for Data Analysis and Visualization at the University of California, Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085571207","id":37085571207,"full_name":"Jennifer Chandler","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute for Data Analysis and Visualization at the University of California, Davis"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute for Data Analysis and Visualization at the University of California, Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38228357000","id":38228357000,"full_name":"Harald Obermaier","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute for Data Analysis and Visualization at the University of California, Davis"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute for Data Analysis and Visualization at the University of California, Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267811400","id":37267811400,"full_name":"Kenneth I.

This procedure can become computationally expensive, especially in scattered, particle-based flow fields, which complicate interpolation due to the lack of an explicit neighborhood structure. If such a particle-based flow field allows for the identification of consecutive particle positions, an alternative approach to particle tracing can be employed: we substitute repeated numerical integration of vector data by geometric interpolation in the highly dynamic particle system as defined by the particle-based simulation. To allow for efficient and accurate location and interpolation of changing particle neighborhoods, we develop a modified k-d tree representation that is capable of creating a dynamic partitioning of even highly compressible data sets with strongly varying particle densities. With this representation we are able to efficiently perform pathline computation by identifying, tracking, and updating an enclosing, dynamic particle neighborhood as particles move overtime. We investigate and evaluate the complexity, accuracy, and robustness of this interpolation-based alternative approach to trajectory generation in compressible and incompressible particle systems generated by simulation techniques such as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH).","article_number":"6817592","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6817592","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6817592/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6817592/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6966852,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"1 Jan. 2015","start_page":"68","end_page":"80","citing_paper_count":26,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":871,"insert_date":"20140516","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Interpolation","Data visualization","Smoothing methods","Data models","Trajectory","Data structures","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Pathlines","particle tracing","SPH","interpolation","flow visualization","time-varying flows"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Flow Visualization","Pathlines","Particle-based Flow","Flow Field","Effect Of Particles","Particle System","Tracer Particles","Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics","Time Step","Flow Velocity","Flow Speed","Velocity Field","Distribution Of Particles","Heat Source","Advection","Numerical Techniques","Particle Position","Position Of Each Particle","Middle Section","Child Nodes","Children Nodes","Binary Tree","Particle Trajectories","Velocity Information","Simulated Particle","Numerical Integration Method","Middle Branch","Small Step Size","Position Update","Neighboring Positions","Spatial Structure Of The Data","Particle Weight","Current Time Step","Simulated Fluid","Integration Of Techniques"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2680452","title":"Evaluating Interactive Graphical Encodings for Data Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"2160-9306","rank":51,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085593133","id":37085593133,"full_name":"Bahador Saket","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086239144","id":37086239144,"full_name":"Arjun Srinivasan","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA"]}},{"affiliation":"Texas A&M University, College Station, TX","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681364500","id":37681364500,"full_name":"Eric D.

A recent trend in visualization is directly embedding user interaction into the visual representations. For example, instead of using control panels to adjust visualization parameters, users can directly adjust basic graphical encodings (e.g., changing distances between points in a scatterplot) to perform similar parameterizations. However, enabling embedded interactions for data visualization requires a strong understanding of how user interactions influence the ability to accurately control and perceive graphical encodings. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of these graphical encodings when serving as the method for interaction. Our user study includes 12 interactive graphical encodings.

A call for proposals typically yields around 30 candidate buildings that need to be evaluated with respect to selected viewpoints. Current visibility analysis methods are very time-consuming and limited to a small number of viewpoints. Further, analysts neither have measures to evaluate candidates quantitatively, nor to compare them efficiently. The primary contribution of this work is the design study of Vis-A-Ware, a visualization system to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate, rank, and compare visibility data of candidate buildings with respect to a large number of viewpoints. Vis-A-Ware features a 3D spatial view of an urban scene and non-spatial views of data derived from visibility evaluations, which are tightly integrated by linked interaction. To enable a quantitative evaluation we developed four metrics in accordance with experts from urban planning. We illustrate the applicability of Vis-A-Ware on the basis of a use case scenario and present results from informal feedback sessions with domain experts from urban planning and development. This feedback suggests that Vis-A-Ware is a valuable tool for visibility analysis allowing analysts to answer complex questions more efficiently and objectively.","article_number":"7390069","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7390069","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7390069/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7390069/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7801955,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"1 Feb. 2017","start_page":"1139","end_page":"1151","citing_paper_count":23,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1161,"insert_date":"20160122","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Urban planning","Data visualization","Buildings","Three-dimensional displays","Measurement","Context"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Geographic/geospatial visualization","visual analytics","integrating spatial and non-spatial data visualization","focus + context techniques","coordinated and multiple views"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Urban Planning","City Planning","Local Planning","Urban Development","Case Scenario","Domain Experts","Urban Scenes","Use Case Scenarios","Transposable","High Impact","Geographic Information System","Bar Charts","New Building","Development Of Sites","Website Development","Evolution Of Sites","Problem Space","Multi-criteria Decision-making","Multi-criteria Decision Analysis","Large Coverage","Number Of Alternatives","Single Candidate","Candidate Values","Small Coverage","Stacked Bar","Rank Candidate","Stacked Bar Charts","Impact Metrics","Single Viewpoint","Image-based Approach","Movement Profiles","Interactive","View In Order","Image Pixels","Building Design"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2507595","title":"Visualizing Dynamic Hierarchies in Graph Sequences","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"10","issn":"2160-9306","rank":53,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"VISUS, University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017348600","id":38017348600,"full_name":"Corinna Vehlow","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VISUS, University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"VISUS, University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586060300","id":37586060300,"full_name":"Fabian Beck","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VISUS, University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"VISUS, University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268045000","id":37268045000,"full_name":"Daniel Weiskopf","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VISUS, University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Graphs are used to model relations between objects, where these objects can be grouped hierarchically based on their connectivity.

Each graph of a sequence is visualized by an adjacency matrix, where the hierarchical group structure is encoded within the matrix using indentation and nested contours, complemented by icicle plots attached to the matrices. The density within and between subgroups of the hierarchy is represented within the matrices using a gray scale. To visualize changes, transitions and dissimilarities between the hierarchically structured graphs are shown using a flow metaphor and color coding. The design of our visualization technique allows us to show more than one hierarchical group structure of the same graph by stacking the sequences, where hierarchy comparison is supported not only within but also between sequences.

Munin utilizes a service-based model where each device provides one or more dynamically loaded services for input, display, or computation. Using a peer-to-peer model for communication, it leverages IP multicast to replicate the shared state among the peers. Input is handled through a shared event channel that lets input and output devices be fully decoupled. It also provides a data-driven scene graph to delegate rendering to peers, thus creating a robust, fault-tolerant, decentralized system. In this paper, we describe Munin's general design and architecture, provide several examples of how we are using the framework for ubiquitous analytics and visualization, and present a case study on building a Munin assembly for multidimensional visualization. We also present performance results and anecdotal user feedback for the framework that suggests that combining a service-oriented, data-driven model with middleware support for data sharing and event handling eases the design and execution of high performance distributed visualizations.","article_number":"6851203","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6851203","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6851203/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6851203/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7000010,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"1 Feb. 2015","start_page":"215","end_page":"228","citing_paper_count":22,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":861,"insert_date":"20140709","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Data visualization","Rendering (computer graphics)","Peer-to-peer computing","Buildings","Computers"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Ubiquitous analytics","high-resolution displays","multi-display environments","distributed visualization","framework","Ubiquitous analytics","high-resolution displays","multi-display environments","distributed visualization","framework"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Mobile Devices","Portable Devices","Multiple Inputs","Data-driven Models","Multiple Outputs","Decentralized System","Multicast","Scene Graph","Visual Representation","Physical Space","Virtual World","Virtual Space","Online World","Multiple Users","Multiple Use","Part Of Surface","Data Sharing","Configuration Space","Multiple Devices","Visual Space","Management Of Events","Event Planning","Services In Order","Scribble","Doodle","2D Surface","Service Layer","Shared Object","Shared Library","Ubiquitous Computing","Android Devices","Android Apps","Network Devices","Mobile Tablets","Physical Setup","Physical Apparatus","Physical Surroundings","Shared Layers"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2371858","title":"Comparing Color and Leader Line Highlighting Strategies in Coordinated View Geovisualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"2160-9306","rank":56,"volume":"21","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Physical, Environmental, and Mathematical Sciences, UNSW, Canberra, Australia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085491978","id":37085491978,"full_name":"Amy L.

Most current geovisualization and information visualization systems use colored outlines or fills to highlight observations, but there remain a wide range of alternative visual strategies that can also be implemented and compared to color highlighting to evaluate user performance. This paper describes the results of an experiment designed to compare user performance with two highlighting methods; color and leader lines. Our study methodology uses eye-tracking to capture participant eye fixations while they answer questions that require attention to highlighted observations in multiple views. Our results show that participants extract information as efficiently from coordinated view displays that use leader line highlighting to link information as they do from those that use a specific color to highlight items. We also found no significant differences when changing the color of the highlighting effect from red to black. We conclude that leader lines show significant potential for use as an alternative highlighting method in coordinated multiple view visualizations, allowing color to be reserved for representing thematic attributes of data.","article_number":"6965627","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6965627","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6965627/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6965627/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7024234,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"1 March 2015","start_page":"339","end_page":"349","citing_paper_count":21,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":807,"insert_date":"20141124","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Image color analysis","Data visualization","Lighting","Color","Educational institutions","Transient analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Evaluation/methodology","Graphical user interfaces","Interaction styles","Information visualization","Evaluation/methodology","graphical user interfaces","interaction styles","information visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Color Line","Leader Lines","Visual Information","Visual Effects","Visual Events","Range Of Strategies","Visual Fixation","Eye Fixation","Fixational Eye Movements","Visual Strategies","User Performance","Wide Range Of Strategies","Interactive","Observed Values","Short-term Memory","Immediate Memory","Early Work","Experimental Task","Simple Task","Perceptual Processing","Simple Effects","Types Of Representations","Regional Mapping","Task Accuracy","Highlighted Regions","Main Experiment","Participant Gender","Visual Hierarchy","Depth Of Field","Visual Interface","Use Of Color","Color Manipulation","Block Of Trials","Trials In Each Block","Visual Design"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2637333","title":"A Statistical Direct Volume Rendering Framework for Visualization of Uncertain Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":57,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer and Information Science and Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38236477800","id":38236477800,"full_name":"Elham Sakhaee","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science and Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer and Information Science and Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268675600","id":37268675600,"full_name":"Alireza Entezari","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science and Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"With uncertainty present in almost all modalities of data acquisition, reduction, transformation, and representation, there is a growing demand for mathematical analysis of uncertainty propagation in data processing pipelines.

Recent work has generalized them to bivariate volumetric fields with fiber surfaces, the pre-image of polygons in range space. However, the existing algorithm for their computation is approximate, and is limited to closed polygons. Moreover, its runtime performance does not allow instantaneous updates of the fiber surfaces upon user edits of the polygons. Overall, these limitations prevent a reliable and interactive exploration of the space of fiber surfaces. This paper introduces the first algorithm for the exact computation of fiber surfaces in tetrahedral meshes. It assumes no restriction on the topology of the input polygon, handles degenerate cases and better captures sharp features induced by polygon bends. The algorithm also allows visualization of individual fibers on the output surface, better illustrating their relationship with data features in range space. To enable truly interactive exploration sessions, we further improve the runtime performance of this algorithm. In particular, we show that it is trivially parallelizable and that it scales nearly linearly with the number of cores. Further, we study acceleration data-structures both in geometrical domain and range space and we show how to generalize interval trees used in isosurface extraction to fiber surface extraction. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over previous work, both in terms of accuracy and running time, with up to two orders of magnitude speedups. This improvement enables interactive edits of range polygons with instantaneous updates of the fiber surface for exploration purpose. A VTK-based reference implementation is provided as additional material to reproduce our results.","article_number":"7471499","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7471499","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7471499/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7471499/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7934157,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"1 July 2017","start_page":"1782","end_page":"1795","citing_paper_count":21,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":654,"insert_date":"20160518","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Isosurfaces","Acceleration","Topology","Feature extraction","Chemicals","Robustness"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Bivariate data","data segmentation","data analysis","isosurfaces","continuous scatterplot"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Fiber Surface","Tetrahedral Mesh","Parallelization","Parallel Computing","Isosurface","Interactive Exploration","Preimage","Inverse Image","Degenerate Case","Surface Extraction","Interpolation","Range Of Functions","Linear Interpolation","Bounding Box","Top Row","Lookup Table","Original Algorithm","Extraction Algorithm","Distance Map","Distance Transform","Distance Field","Middle Row","Range Of Lines","Triangular Mesh","Triangle Mesh","Resolution Raster","Parallel Algorithm","Signed Distance Function","Signed Distance Field","Mesh Cell","Range Cell","Hausdorff Distance","Gradient Magnitude","Fast Query","Minimum Bounding Box","Axis-aligned Bounding Box","Child Nodes","Children Nodes"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2811488","title":"Lineage: Visualizing Multivariate Clinical Data in Genealogy Graphs","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"2160-9306","rank":59,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399400500","id":37399400500,"full_name":"Carolina Nobre","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37972937500","id":37972937500,"full_name":"Nils Gehlenborg","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086607693","id":37086607693,"full_name":"Hilary Coon","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37395933400","id":37395933400,"full_name":"Alexander Lex","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The majority of diseases that are a significant challenge for public and individual heath are caused by a combination of hereditary and environmental factors.

In many situations, users find them a flexible method to analyze and interact with data. Unfortunately, using PCPs becomes challenging as the number of data items grows large or multiple trends within the data mix in the visualization. The resulting overdraw can obscure important features. A number of modifications to PCPs have been proposed, including using color, opacity, smooth curves, frequency, density, and animation to mitigate this problem. However, these modified PCPs tend to have their own limitations in the kinds of relationships they emphasize. We propose a new data scalable design for representing and exploring data relationships in PCPs. The approach exploits the point/line duality property of PCPs and a local linear assumption of data to extract and represent relationship summarizations. This approach simultaneously shows relationships in the data and the consistency of those relationships. Our approach supports various visualization tasks, including mixed linear and nonlinear pattern identification, noise detection, and outlier detection, all in large data.

Simplification of trajectories can improve the visibility of relevant information by reducing less relevant details while maintaining important movement patterns. We propose a systematic stepwise methodology for simplifying and thematically enhancing trajectories in order to support their visual analysis. The methodology is applied iteratively and is composed of: (a) a simplification step applied to reduce the morphological complexity of the trajectories, (b) a thematic enhancement step which aims at accentuating patterns of movement, and (c) the representation and interactive exploration of the results in order to make interpretations of the findings and further refinement to the simplification and enhancement process.

Recent advances in the (topological) analysis of 3D symmetric tensor fields focus on degenerate tensors which form curves. In this paper, we introduce a number of feature surfaces, such as neutral surfaces and traceless surfaces, into tensor field analysis, based on the notion of eigenvalue manifold. Neutral surfaces are the boundary between linear tensors and planar tensors, and the traceless surfaces are the boundary between tensors of positive traces and those of negative traces. Degenerate curves, neutral surfaces, and traceless surfaces together form a partition of the eigenvalue manifold, which provides a more complete tensor field analysis than degenerate curves alone. We also extract and visualize the isosurfaces of tensor modes, tensor isotropy, and tensor magnitude, which we have found useful for domain applications in fluid and solid mechanics. Extracting neutral and traceless surfaces using the Marching Tetrahedra method can cause the loss of geometric and topological details, which can lead to false physical interpretation. To robustly extract neutral surfaces and traceless surfaces, we develop a polynomial description of them which enables us to borrow techniques from algebraic surface extraction, a topic well-researched by the computer-aided design (CAD) community as well as the algebraic geometry community. In addition, we adapt the surface extraction technique, called A-patches, to improve the speed of finding degenerate curves. Finally, we apply our analysis to data from solid and fluid mechanics as well as scalar field analysis.","article_number":"7286850","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7286850","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7286850/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7286850/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7393931,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"1 March 2016","start_page":"1248","end_page":"1260","citing_paper_count":19,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":779,"insert_date":"20151001","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Tensile stress","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Manifolds","Three-dimensional displays","Feature extraction","Indexes","Topology"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Tensor field visualization","feature-based visualization","tensor field topology","traceless tensors","A-patches","scalar fields","Tensor field visualization","feature-based visualization","tensor field topology","traceless tensors","A-patches","scalar fields"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Symmetric Tensor","Symmetric Field","Symmetric Tensor Field","Wide Range Of Applications","Field Of Analysis","Topological Analysis","Fluid Mechanics","Solid Mechanics","Hardening Mechanism","Curing Mechanism","Traceless","Neutral Surface","Surface Extraction","Positive Mode","Negative Mode","Fluid Dynamics","Control Points","Types Of Regions","Vector Field","Stress Tensor","Deviatoric Stress","Differential Stress","Incompressible Flow","Incompressible Fluids","Bernstein Polynomials","Planar Type","Convex Shape","Degenerate Points","Von Mises Stress","Shear Deformation","Pure Shear","Invariant Theory","Invariant Tensor","Cutting-plane","Cutting Plane Method","Fundamental Group"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2535340","title":"Analyzing Eye-Tracking Information in Visualization and Data Space: From Where on the Screen to What on the Screen","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"5","issn":"2160-9306","rank":64,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Computing and Information Sciences, Florida International University, Miami, FL","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086137303","id":37086137303,"full_name":"Sayeed Safayet Alam","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computing and Information Sciences, Florida International University, Miami, FL"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computing and Information Sciences, Florida International University, Miami, FL","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37887934300","id":37887934300,"full_name":"Radu Jianu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computing and Information Sciences, Florida International University, Miami, FL"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Eye-tracking data is currently analyzed in the image space that gaze-coordinates were recorded in, generally with the help of overlays such as heatmaps or scanpaths, or with the help of manually defined areas of interest (AOI).

Alternatively, we show that it is feasible to collect and analyze eye-tracking information in data space. Specifically, the visual layout of visualizations with open source code that can be instrumented is known at rendering time, and thus can be used to relate gaze-coordinates to visualization and data objects that users view, in real time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by showing that data collected using this methodology from nine users working with an interactive visualization, was well aligned with the tasks that those users were asked to solve, and similar to annotation data produced by five human coders. Moreover, we introduce an algorithm that, given our instrumented visualization, could translate gaze-coordinates into viewed objects with greater accuracy than simply binning gazes into dynamically defined AOIs. Finally, we discuss the challenges, opportunities, and benefits of analyzing eye-tracking in visualization and data space.","article_number":"7420740","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7420740","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7420740/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7420740/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7891682,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"1 May 2017","start_page":"1492","end_page":"1505","citing_paper_count":17,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1834,"insert_date":"20160226","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Instruments","Layout","Rendering (computer graphics)","Real-time systems","Computers"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Eye-tracking","area of interest analysis","usability analysis","evaluation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Space","Visual Space","Instrumentation","Backtracking","Open-source Software","Open Software","Open Coding","Source Code","Data Compression","Interactive Visualization","Eye-tracking Data","Human Coding","User Views","Semantic","Data Visualization","Protein-protein Interaction Network","Protein Interaction Network","Object Detection","Prediction Algorithms","Transition Probabilities","Visual Network","Network Diagram","Space Model","Prediction Approach","Multiple Objects","Visual Object","Visual Content","High Granularity","Screen Space","Output Of Algorithm","Visual Environment","Absolute Certainty","Visual Items","Think-aloud Protocols","Interactive Data Visualization","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2513389","title":"ThermalPlot: Visualizing Multi-Attribute Time-Series Data Using a Thermal Metaphor","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":65,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Johannes Kepler University Linz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085497544","id":37085497544,"full_name":"Holger Stitz","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Johannes Kepler University Linz"]}},{"affiliation":"Johannes Kepler University Linz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077342300","id":37077342300,"full_name":"Samuel Gratzl","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Johannes Kepler University Linz"]}},{"affiliation":"St. Poelten University of Applied Sciences","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267339500","id":37267339500,"full_name":"Wolfgang Aigner","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["St. Poelten University of Applied Sciences"]}},{"affiliation":"Johannes Kepler University Linz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403918900","id":37403918900,"full_name":"Marc Streit","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Johannes Kepler University Linz"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Multi-attribute time-series data plays a vital role in many different domains, such as economics, sensor networks, and biology. An important task when making sense of such data is to provide users with an overview to identify items that show an interesting development over time, including both absolute and relative changes in multiple attributes simultaneously. However, this is not well supported by existing visualization techniques. To address this issue, we present ThermalPlot, a visualization technique that summarizes combinations of multiple attributes over time using an items position, the most salient visual variable. More precisely, the x-position in the  ThermalPlot is based on a user-defined degree-of-interest (DoI) function that combines multiple attributes over time. The y-position is determined by the relative change in the DoI value ( $\\Delta$ DoI) within a user-specified time window. Animating this mapping via a moving time window gives rise to circular movements of items over time—as in thermal systems. To help the user to identify important items that match user-defined temporal patterns and to increase the technique's scalability, we adapt the level of detail of the items’ representation based on the DoI value. Furthermore, we present an interactive exploration environment for multi-attribute time-series data that ties together a carefully chosen set of visualizations, designed to support analysts in interacting with the ThermalPlot technique. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique by means of two usage scenarios that address the visual analysis of economic development data and of stock market data.","article_number":"7369992","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7369992","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7369992/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7369992/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7707444,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"1 Dec. 2016","start_page":"2594","end_page":"2607","citing_paper_count":17,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":883,"insert_date":"20151231","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Trajectory","Time series analysis","Animation","Context modeling","Encoding","Market research","Semantics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Time-dependent data","multi-attribute data","focus+context","semantic zooming"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Time Series Data","Interactive","Scalable","Time Window","Changes In Properties","Multiple Dimensions","Multiple Attributes","Multiple Properties","Stock Market","Sensor Networks","Visualization Techniques","Usage Scenarios","Stock Market Data","Section For Details","Interest Rate","Deposition Rate","Large Collection","Evolution Of Properties","Property Development","Energy Sector","Detailed View","Weight Components","Treemap","Functional Tree","Performance Of Trees","Line Chart","Selected Time Window","Exponential Smoothing","Short-term Interest Rate","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Item Development","Dividend Yield","Dividend-price Ratio","Price-dividend Ratio","Plot Position","Attribute Values","Earnings Per Share","Item Locations","Item Position"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2750689","title":"A Vector Field Design Approach to Animated Transitions","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"9","issn":"2160-9306","rank":66,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085635207","id":37085635207,"full_name":"Yong Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"Swansea University, Swansea, United Kingdom","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396011500","id":37396011500,"full_name":"Daniel Archambault","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Swansea University, Swansea, United Kingdom"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550809300","id":37550809300,"full_name":"Carlos E.

In this paper, we introduce animated transition design, a technique to build smooth, non-linear transitions for clustered data with either minimal or no user involvement. The technique is flexible and simple to implement, and has the additional advantage that it explicitly enhances coordinated motion and can avoid crowding, which are both important factors to support object tracking in a scene.

Relying on multidimensional projection and mixed integer optimization, our approach arranges geometric objects in the visual space so as to generate well structured layouts that preserve the semantic relation among objects while still making an efficient use of display area. Moreover, scalability is handled through a hierarchical representation scheme combined with navigation tools.

Traditional parallel coordinates are well prepared to show negative correlations between two attributes by distinct visual patterns. However, it is difficult to recognize positive correlations in parallel coordinates. Furthermore, there is no support to highlight multivariate correlations in parallel coordinates. In this paper, we exploit the indexed point representation of p -flats (planes in multidimensional data) to visualize local multivariate correlations in parallel coordinates. Our method yields clear visual signatures for negative and positive correlations alike, and it supports large datasets. All information is shown in a unified parallel coordinates framework, which leads to easy and familiar user interactions for analysts who have experience with traditional parallel coordinates. The usefulness of our method is demonstrated through examples of typical multidimensional datasets.","article_number":"7911335","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7911335","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7911335/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7911335/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8352603,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"1 June 2018","start_page":"1997","end_page":"2010","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1083,"insert_date":"20170425","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Correlation","Visualization","Two dimensional displays","Geometry","Brushes","Shape"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Multidimensional data visualization","multivariate correlations","parallel coordinates"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Multivariate Correlation","Parallel Coordinates","Visualization Of Correlations","Positive Correlation","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Multidimensional Data","Multidimensional Analysis","Visual Patterns","Representative Points","Local Correlation","Negatively Correlated","Eigenvectors","Visual Analysis","Dimensional Data","Dependent And Independent Variables","3D Space","3-dimensional Space","Multivariate Data","Multivariate Statistics","Dimensional Structure","Visual Methods","Visual Method","Line Segment","Coordinate Origin","High-dimensional Datasets","High-dimensional Data Sets","Scatterplot Matrix","Scatter Plot Matrix","Scatterplot Matrices","Visual Analysis Of Data","Local Fitting","Polyline","Inselbergs","Isolated Hills","Kopje","2D Image Plane","Nonlinear Correlation","Tangent Vector"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2414454","title":"VisDock: A Toolkit for Cross-Cutting Interactions in Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"9","issn":"2160-9306","rank":69,"volume":"21","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085504378","id":37085504378,"full_name":"Jungu Choi","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Information Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, MD","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085506226","id":37085506226,"full_name":"Deok Gun Park","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Information Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, MD"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085419236","id":37085419236,"full_name":"Yuet Ling Wong","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085372000","id":37085372000,"full_name":"Eli Fisher","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Information Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, MD","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295438200","id":37295438200,"full_name":"Niklas Elmqvist","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Information Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, MD"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Standard user applications provide a range of cross-cutting interaction techniques that are common to virtually all such tools: selection, filtering, navigation, layer management, and cut-and-paste.

However, such comparative evaluation is not supported well by current methods. We present a novel system for assessing and comparing segmentation quality in a dataset with multiple 3D images. The data is analyzed and visualized in several views. We detect and show regions with systematic segmentation quality characteristics. For this purpose, we extended a hierarchical clustering algorithm with a connectivity criterion. We combine quality values across the dataset for determining regions with characteristic segmentation quality across instances. Using our system, the experts can also identify 3D segmentations with extraordinary quality characteristics. While we focus on algorithms based on statistical shape models, our approach can also be applied to cases, where landmark correspondences among instances can be established. We applied our approach to three real datasets: liver, cochlea and facial nerve. The segmentation experts were able to identify organ regions with systematic segmentation characteristics as well as to detect outlier instances.","article_number":"7331662","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7331662","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7331662/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7331662/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7707444,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"1 Dec. 2016","start_page":"2537","end_page":"2549","citing_paper_count":12,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":744,"insert_date":"20151119","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image segmentation","Three-dimensional displays","Biomedical monitoring","Visual analytics","Medical diagnostic imaging","Systematics","Statistical analysis","Clustering"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","3D medical image segmentation quality","comparison","clustering","statistical shape models"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["3D Images","Image Segmentation","Local Quality","Local Character","3D Segmentation","Medical Image Segmentation","Hierarchical Clustering","Hierarchical Cluster Analysis","Clustering Algorithm","Multiple Images","Quality Characteristics","Quality Features","Quality Value","Segmentation Algorithm","Cochlea","Automatic Segmentation","Facial Nerve","Segmentation Quality","Organizer Regions","Statistical Shape Model","Statistical Shape Analysis","Shape Statistics","High-quality","Similar Characteristics","Similar Quality","Similar Features","Segmentation Results","Ground Truth Segmentation","Segmentation Evaluation","Set Of Segments","Good Segmentation","Detailed View","Neighbor Clustering","Neighborhood Clustering","Agglomerative Clustering","Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering","3D Mesh","Surface Mesh","Similar Segments","Triangular Mesh","Triangle Mesh"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2810919","title":"Exploring Variability within Ensembles of Decadal Climate Predictions","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"2160-9306","rank":72,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, TU Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085701367","id":37085701367,"full_name":"Christopher P.

As the shape of a streamline is often related to some underlying property of the field, it is important to identify streamlines (or their parts) with unique geometric features. In this paper, we introduce a metric, called the box counting ratio, which measures the geometric complexity of streamlines by measuring their space-filling capacity at different scales. We propose a novel interactive visualization framework which utilizes this metric to extract, organize and visualize features of varying density and complexity hidden in large numbers of streamlines. The proposed framework extracts complex regions of varying density from the streamlines, and organizes and presents them on an interactive 2D information space, allowing user selection and visualization of streamlines.

We introduce semantic flow graph (SFG), a novel graph representation and interaction framework that enables users to explore the relationships among key objects (i.e., field lines, features, and spatiotemporal regions) of both steady and unsteady flow fields. The objects and their relationships are organized as a heterogeneous graph. We assign each object a set of attributes, based on which a semantic abstraction of the heterogeneous graph is generated. This semantic abstraction is SFG. We design a suite of operations to explore the underlying flow fields based on this graph representation and abstraction mechanism. Users can flexibly reconfigure SFG to examine the relationships among groups of objects at different abstraction levels. Three linked views are developed to display SFG, its node split criteria and history, and the objects in the spatial volume. For simplicity, we introduce SFG construction and exploration for steady flow fields with critical points being the only features. Then we demonstrate that SFG can be naturally extended to deal with unsteady flow fields and multiple types of features. We experiment with multiple data sets and conduct an expert evaluation to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","article_number":"8118164","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8118164","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8118164/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8118164/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8511004,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"1 Dec. 2018","start_page":"3200","end_page":"3213","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":753,"insert_date":"20171122","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Semantics","Visualization","History","Two dimensional displays","Clutter","Three-dimensional displays","Aerodynamics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Flow visualization","heterogeneous graph","semantic abstraction","critical points","vortex cores","FTLE","field lines"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Flow Field","Semantic Graph","Critical Point","Graphical Representation","Steady Flow","Unsteady Flow","Field Lines","Flux Lines","Heterogeneous Graph","Time Step","Streamline","Flow Patterns","Vector Field","Types Of Nodes","Types Of Points","Set Of Data Points","Points In The Dataset","Spatial Regions","Red Rectangle","Kinds Of Objects","Types Of Edges","Node Splitting","Vortex Core","Supercurrent","Different Types Of Objects","High PM10","Pathlines","Operator Splitting","Cloud Fraction","Child Nodes","Children Nodes","Original Space","Different Types Of Nodes"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2818701","title":"Robust Tracing and Visualization of Heterogeneous Microvascular Networks","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"4","issn":"2160-9306","rank":76,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of Houston, Houston, TX","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086695381","id":37086695381,"full_name":"Pavel A.

In this work, we present a new data representation which combines both reference frames into a joint Eulerian-Lagrangian format. By reorganizing Lagrangian information according to the Eulerian simulation grid into a “unit cell” based approach, we can provide an efficient out-of-core means of sampling, querying, and operating with both representations simultaneously. We also extend this design to generate multi-resolution subsets of the full data to suit the viewer's needs and provide a fast flow-aware trajectory construction scheme.

In the physical world, lightness constancy allows people to accurately perceive shadowed colors; however, its effectiveness in complex synthetic environments such as surface visualizations is not well understood. We report a series of crowdsourced and laboratory studies that confirm the existence of lightness constancy effects for molecular surface visualizations using ambient occlusion. We provide empirical evidence of how common visualization design decisions can impact viewers' abilities to accurately identify encoded surface colors. These findings suggest that lightness constancy aids in understanding color encodings in surface visualization and reveal a correlation between visualization techniques that improve color interpretation in shadow and those that enhance perceptions of surface depth.

The velocity of a particle on the screen is typically linearly scaled by the velocities in the data. However, the perception of velocity magnitude in animated particles is not necessarily linear. We present a study on how different parameters affect relative motion perception. We have investigated the impact of four parameters. The parameters consist of speed multiplier, direction, contrast type and the global velocity scale. In addition, we investigated if multiple motion cues, and point distribution, affect the speed estimation. Several studies were executed to investigate the impact of each parameter. In the initial results, we noticed trends in scale and multiplier. Using the trends for the significant parameters, we designed a compensation model, which adjusts the particle speed to compensate for the effect of the parameters. We then performed a second study to investigate the performance of the compensation model. From the second study we detected a constant estimation error, which we adjusted for in the last study. In addition, we connect our work to established theories in psychophysics by comparing our model to a model based on Stevens' Power Law.","article_number":"6811168","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6811168","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6811168/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6811168/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6909091,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"1 Nov. 2014","start_page":"1542","end_page":"1554","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":938,"insert_date":"20140507","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Image color analysis","Brain modeling","Data visualization","Motion detection","Particle measurements"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Motion visualization","motion perception","animation","evaluation","perceptual model"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Uniform Spacing","Perceptually Uniform","Estimation Error","Error Of Approximation","Global Scale","Effect Of Parameters","Power-law","Scaling Law","Flow Field","Particle Velocity","Psychophysics","Multiple Cues","Speed Estimation","Compensation Model","Particle Speed","Analysis Of Variance Test","Flow Direction","Average Error","Visual Cues","Error Distribution","Direction Of Motion","Motion Detection","Motion Sensors","Round Of The Study","Change In Error","Just Noticeable Difference","Average Estimation Error","Human Visual System","CIELAB Color Space","Comet Tail","Luminance Contrast","Test Particle","LCD Screen"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2327977","title":"Direct Isosurface Ray Casting of NURBS-Based Isogeometric Analysis","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"9","issn":"2160-9306","rank":81,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Virtual Reality Systems Group at the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38131871600","id":38131871600,"full_name":"Andre Schollmeyer","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virtual Reality Systems Group at the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar"]}},{"affiliation":"Virtual Reality Systems Group at the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282977500","id":37282977500,"full_name":"Bernd Froehlich","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virtual Reality Systems Group at the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In NURBS-based isogeometric analysis, the basis functions of a 3D model's geometric description also form the basis for the solution space of variational formulations of partial differential equations. In order to visualize the results of a NURBS-based isogeometric analysis, we developed a novel GPU-based multi-pass isosurface visualization technique which performs directly on an equivalent rational Bézier representation without the need for discretization or approximation. Our approach utilizes rasterization to generate a list of intervals along the ray that each potentially contain boundary or isosurface intersections. Depth-sorting this list for each ray allows us to proceed in front-to-back order and enables early ray termination. We detect multiple intersections of a ray with the higher-order surface of the model using a sampling-based root-isolation method. The model's surfaces and the isosurfaces always appear smooth, independent of the zoom level due to our pixel-precise processing scheme. Our adaptive sampling strategy minimizes costs for point evaluations and intersection computations. The implementation shows that the proposed approach interactively visualizes volume meshes containing hundreds of thousands of Bézier elements on current graphics hardware. A comparison to a GPU-based ray casting implementation using spatial data structures indicates that our approach generally performs significantly faster while being more accurate.","article_number":"6846294","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6846294","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6846294/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6846294/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6863724,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"1 Sept. 2014","start_page":"1227","end_page":"1240","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":439,"insert_date":"20140630","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Isosurfaces","Splines (mathematics)","Surface topography","Surface reconstruction","Solid modeling","Casting"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Computer graphics","data visualization","isosurfaces","NURBS","ray casting"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Ray Casting","Ray Shooting","Isogeometric Analysis","Data Structure","Linear Representation","Equivalent Representation","Adaptive Sampling","Current Hardware","Multiple Intersections","Spatial Structure Of The Data","Volume Mesh","Finite Element","Entry Point","Grid Cells","Control Points","Regular Grid","Cartesian Grid","Grid Structure","Rectangular Grid","Direct Visualization","Newton Method","Newton Iteration","Newton Raphson","Raphson Method","Convex Hull","Computer-aided Design","Polynomial Of Degree","Interactive Visualization","Exit Point","Relevant Interval","Relevant Time Intervals","B-spline Basis Functions","Parallelepiped","Space Domain","Sorting Algorithm","Local Extrema","Points In Cells","First Pass"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2362543","title":"VectorLens: Angular Selection of Curves within 2D Dense Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"2160-9306","rank":82,"volume":"21","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Croesus Finansoft, Laval, QC, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38528902900","id":38528902900,"full_name":"Maxime Dumas","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Croesus Finansoft, Laval, QC, Canada","Ecole de Technologie Superieure of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"Ecole de Technologie Superieure of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38526446600","id":38526446600,"full_name":"Michael J.

Integral histograms (IH) greatly accelerate the calculation in the case of rectangular regions, but come at a large extra storage cost. Based on the tensor train decomposition model, we propose a new compression and approximate retrieval algorithm to reduce the overall IH memory usage by several orders of magnitude at a user-defined accuracy. To this end we propose an incremental tensor decomposition algorithm that allows us to compress integral histograms of hundreds of gigabytes. We then encode the borders of any desired rectangular ROI in the IH tensor-compressed domain and reconstruct the target histogram at a high speed which is independent of the region size. We furthermore generalize the algorithm to support regions of arbitrary shape rather than only rectangles, as well as histogram field computation, i.e., recovering many histograms at once. We test our method with several multidimensional data sets and demonstrate that it radically speeds up costly histogram queries while avoiding storing massive, uncompressed IHs.","article_number":"8281540","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8281540","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8281540/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8281540/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8594686,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"1 Feb. 2019","start_page":"1435","end_page":"1446","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":441,"insert_date":"20180205","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Histograms","Tensile stress","Data visualization","Tools","Data structures","Approximation algorithms","Two dimensional displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Integral histograms","tensor decomposition","multidimensional compression"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Tensor Decomposition","Integral Histogram","Multidimensional Data","Multidimensional Analysis","Rectangular Region","Compression Algorithm","Multidimensional Datasets","Multidimensional Data Sets","Large Regions Of Interest","Incremental Algorithm","Rectangular Region Of Interest","High-dimensional","High-dimensional Space","Time Constant","Singular Value","Singular Value Decomposition","GB Memory","Vector Field","Dot Product","Peak Signal-to-noise Ratio","Peak Signal To Noise Ratio","PSNR","Cumulative Sum","Vision Applications","Computer Graphics","2D Case","Spatial Axis","Query Time","Normalized Cross-correlation","Normalized Cross-correlation Coefficient","Histogram Bins","Tensor Approximation","Tensor Estimation","Bin Counts","Counts In Each Bin","Target Region Of Interest","Target Region-of-interest","Compression Rate","Hurricane","Tropical Cyclones"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2824822","title":"Visualizing a Thinker's Life","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"4","issn":"2160-9306","rank":84,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Virtual Reality and Visualization Research Group, Bauhaus-Universität Weimar, Weimar, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38262580000","id":38262580000,"full_name":"Patrick Riehmann","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virtual Reality and Visualization Research Group, Bauhaus-Universität Weimar, Weimar, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Virtual Reality and Visualization Research Group, Bauhaus-Universität Weimar, Weimar, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086696433","id":37086696433,"full_name":"Dora Kiesel","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virtual Reality and Visualization Research Group, Bauhaus-Universität Weimar, Weimar, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Kohlhaas & Kohlhaas Agency in Weimar, Weimar, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086697152","id":37086697152,"full_name":"Martin Kohlhaas","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Kohlhaas & Kohlhaas Agency in Weimar, Weimar, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Virtual Reality and Visualization Research Group, Bauhaus-Universität Weimar, Weimar, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282977500","id":37282977500,"full_name":"Bernd Froehlich","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virtual Reality and Visualization Research Group, Bauhaus-Universität Weimar, Weimar, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"This paper presents a visualization framework that aids readers in understanding and analyzing the contents of medium-sized text collections that are typical for the opus of a single or few authors.

Analysis of these data requires tacit knowledge to fill `gaps' so that predictions can be made for incomplete data. Through discussions with 30 industry and academic specialists, we identified three analysis use cases that exemplified the limitations of current petrophysics analysis tools. We used those use cases to develop nine core requirements for PETMiner, which is innovative because of its ability to display detailed images of the samples as data points, directly plot multiple sample properties and derived measures for comparison, and substantially reduce interaction cost. An 11-month evaluation demonstrated benefits across all three use cases by allowing a consultant to: (1) generate more accurate reservoir flow models, (2) discover a previously unknown relationship between one easy-to-measure property and another that is costly, and (3) make a 100-fold reduction in the time required to produce plots for a report.","article_number":"7879300","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7879300","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7879300/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7879300/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8326693,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"1 May 2018","start_page":"1728","end_page":"1741","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":587,"insert_date":"20170315","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Mathematical model","Reservoirs","Data visualization","Rocks","Data analysis","Permeability","Visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization systems and software","information visualization","design study"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visualization Tool","Core Samples","Visual Analytics Tool","Petrophysical Properties","Interactive","Scanning Electron Microscopy Images","Properties Of Samples","Use Of Imaging","Image Manipulation","Main Data","Contextual Data","Rock Types","Depositional Environment","Sedimentary Environment","Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Data","Individual Data Points","Log Files","Deep Relationships","Plot Points","Points In Each Plot","Commercial Tools","Creation Time","Spotfire","Multiple Plots","4K Resolution","4K UHD","4K Camera","None Of The Tools","None Of These Tools","Column Plots","Visual Encoding","Additional Column","Industry Partners","Industrial Partners","User Requirements","Scanning Electron Microscopy","Relative Permeability","Magnetic Permeability","Permeability Of Space"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.279","title":"Empirical Studies in Information Visualization: Seven Scenarios","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"9","issn":"2160-9306","rank":86,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Google, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37873130000","id":37873130000,"full_name":"Heidi Lam","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Google, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38267713800","id":38267713800,"full_name":"Enrico Bertini","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Team Aviz, INRIA, Université Paris-Sud, Orsay, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591317800","id":37591317800,"full_name":"Petra Isenberg","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Team Aviz, INRIA, Université Paris-Sud, Orsay, France"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283026800","id":37283026800,"full_name":"Catherine Plaisant","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37285000100","id":37285000100,"full_name":"Sheelagh Carpendale","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We take a new, scenario-based look at evaluation in information visualization.

Going beyond the standard representations of search-centric and grid-based interfaces, a multitude of approaches has recently started to enable visual access to cultural collections, and to explore them as complex and comprehensive information spaces by the means of interactive visualizations. In contrast to conventional web interfaces, we witness a widening spectrum of innovative visualization types specially designed for rich collections from the cultural heritage sector. This new class of information visualizations gives rise to a notable diversity of interaction and representation techniques while lending currency and urgency to a discussion about principles such as serendipity, generosity, and criticality in connection with visualization design. With this survey, we review information visualization approaches to digital cultural heritage collections and reflect on the state of the art in techniques and design choices. We contextualize our survey with humanist perspectives on the field and point out opportunities for future research.","article_number":"8352050","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8352050","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8352050/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8352050/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8703191,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"1 June 2019","start_page":"2311","end_page":"2330","citing_paper_count":88,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":14806,"insert_date":"20180427","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Cultural differences","Data visualization","Libraries","Visualization","Art","Prototypes","Tools"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Information visualization","introductory and survey","digital libraries","arts and humanities"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Cultural Heritage","Cultural Significance","Cultural Knowledge","State Of The Art","State-of-the-art","Interactive","Visual Information","Large Collection","Serendipitous","Serendipity","Information In Space","Visual Design","Digital Collection","User Groups","Spatial Dimensions","Spatial Attributes","Image Object","Multiple Perspectives","Visual Methods","Visual Method","Critical Discourse","Critical Discussion","Cloud Data","Word Cloud","Word Clouds","Textual Descriptions","Visualization Techniques","Temporal Aspects","Visual Perspective","Linear Perspective","Perspective View","Perspective Projection","Digital Humanities","Digital Humanitarianism","Cultural Artefacts","Cultural Artifacts","Prominent Methods","Prominent Method","Cultural Objects","Cultural Goods","Visual Literacy","Accidental Discovery","Accidental Finding","Visual Interface","Digital Interface","Visual Encoding","Source Text"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2014.82","title":"Visualization beyond the Desktop--the Next Big Thing","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"1558-1756","rank":89,"volume":"34","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Bangor University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37278794800","id":37278794800,"full_name":"Jonathan C.

Based on their analysis of 30 quantified self-presentations, they characterized eight insight types (detail, self-reflection, trend, comparison, correlation, data summary, distribution, and outlier) and mapped the visual annotations used to communicate them. They further discussed four areas for the design of personal visualization systems, including support for encouraging self-reflection, gaining valid insight, communicating insight, and using visual annotations.","article_number":"7106391","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7106391","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7106391/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7106391/","publication_title":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","publication_number":38,"is_number":7160864,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"July-Aug. 2015","start_page":"28","end_page":"37","citing_paper_count":64,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2908,"insert_date":"20150513","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Context modeling","Taxonomy","Encoding","Market research"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["computer graphics","visualization insights","personal information visualization","quantified self","quantified selfers","personal informatics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Personal Data","Data Visualization","Visual System","Exploratory Data","Vision Research","Statistical Evidence","Gain Insight","Personal Context","Challenging Part","Line Chart","Personal Insights","User Function","People Gain","Visualization Tool","Bar Charts","Domain Experts","Time Segments","Visual Evidence","External Context","Type Of Visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.240","title":"An Evaluation of Depth Enhancing Perceptual Cues for Vascular Volume Visualization in Neurosurgery","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"2160-9306","rank":91,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Montreal Neurological Institute, Montreal, QC, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086636258","id":37086636258,"full_name":"Marta Kersten-Oertel","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Montreal Neurological Institute, Montreal, QC, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Montreal Neurological Institute, Montreal, QC, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085475605","id":37085475605,"full_name":"Sean Jy-Shyang Chen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Montreal Neurological Institute, Montreal, QC, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Montreal Neurological Institute, Montreal, QC, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38556148200","id":38556148200,"full_name":"D.

Two experiments with novices and one experiment with experts were performed. The results with novices showed that the pseudo-chromadepth and fog cues were stronger cues than that of stereopsis. Furthermore, the addition of the stereopsis cue to the other cues did not improve relative depth perception in cerebral vascular volumes. In contrast to novices, the experts also performed well with the edge cue. In terms of both novice and expert subjects, pseudo-chromadepth and fog allow for the best relative depth perception. By using such cues to improve depth perception of cerebral vasculature, we may improve diagnosis, surgical planning, and intraoperative guidance.","article_number":"6620865","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6620865","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6620865/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6620865/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6777146,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"March 2014","start_page":"391","end_page":"403","citing_paper_count":62,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1212,"insert_date":"20131004","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Angiography","Three-dimensional displays","Surgery","Stereo image processing","Kinetic theory"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Depth cues","stereo","chromadepth","fog","volume rendering","vascular data","vessels","angiography"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Perceptual Cues","Vascular Volume","Cerebral Vessels","Cerebral Blood Vessels","Regional Cerebral Blood Flow","Cerebral Circulation","Cerebral Vasculature","Effects Of Cues","Surgical Planning","Relative Depth","Stereopsis","Stereovision","Stereoscopic Vision","Depth Perception","Depth Cues","Spatial Layout","Furcation","Surgeons","Response Time","Interaction Patterns","Effect Of Distance","Object Shape","Median Distance","Intuitive Understanding","Intuitive Knowledge","Intuitive Reasoning","Significant Three-way Interaction","Significant Two-way Interaction","Spatial Understanding","Cerebral Angiography","Cerebral Angiogram","Cue Interaction","Single Cue","Cues In Experiment","Image-guided Surgery","Angiographic Data","Spatial Depth","3D Glasses","Volumetric Data"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2509990","title":"Online Visual Analytics of Text Streams","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"11","issn":"2160-9306","rank":92,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Software, Tsinghua University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406039100","id":37406039100,"full_name":"Shixia Liu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Software, Tsinghua University"]}},{"affiliation":"Tsinghua University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085841726","id":37085841726,"full_name":"Jialun Yin","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tsinghua University"]}},{"affiliation":"Tsinghua University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085460249","id":37085460249,"full_name":"Xiting Wang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tsinghua University"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37391623900","id":37391623900,"full_name":"Weiwei Cui","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Tsinghua University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085845125","id":37085845125,"full_name":"Kelei Cao","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tsinghua University"]}},{"affiliation":"Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37276034900","id":37276034900,"full_name":"Jian Pei","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present an online visual analytics approach to helping users explore and understand hierarchical topic evolution in high-volume text streams.

A dynamic Bayesian network model has been developed to derive the tree cuts in the incoming topic trees to balance the fitness of each tree cut and the smoothness between adjacent tree cuts. By connecting the corresponding topics at different times, we are able to provide an overview of the evolving hierarchical topics.

We show that these sensitivities are good indicators of the distribution of centrality in the network, and how changes are expected to be propagated if we introduce changes to the network. These metrics also help us simplify a complex network in a way that retains the main structural properties and that results in trustworthy, readable diagrams. Sensitivity is also a key concept for uncertainty analysis of social networks, and we show how our approach may help analysts gain insight on the robustness of key network metrics.

Our approach facilitates tasks for volume analysis that are challenging to achieve using existing rendering techniques such as ray casting or texture-based methods. We show how to guide the user in transfer function editing by quantifying expected change in the output image. Additionally, the generative model transforms transfer functions into a view-invariant latent space specifically designed to synthesize volume-rendered images. We use this space directly for rendering, enabling the user to explore the space of volume-rendered images. As our model is independent of the choice of volume rendering process, we show how to analyze volume-rendered images produced by direct and global illumination lighting, for a variety of volume datasets.","article_number":"8316963","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8316963","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8316963/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8316963/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8653248,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"1 April 2019","start_page":"1636","end_page":"1650","citing_paper_count":54,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1716,"insert_date":"20180315","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Transfer functions","Solid modeling","Gallium nitride","Image color analysis","Computational modeling","Sensitivity"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Volume rendering","generative models","deep learning","generative adversarial networks"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Volume Rendering","Volumetric Rendering","Volume-rendering","Transfer Function","Generative Adversarial Networks","Adversarial Learning","Latent Space","Embedding Space","Image Space","Image Change","Output Image","Direct Illumination","Ray Casting","Ray Shooting","Root Mean Square Error","Root-mean-square Deviation","Root-mean-square Error","RMSD","RMSE","Deep Neural Network","Convolutional Layers","Image Pixels","Color Images","Colour Images","Fully-connected Layer","Fully Connected Layer","Color Map","Colour Map","Colormap","Scalar Value","Volumetric Data","Series Of Layers","Visual Parameters","Earth Mover’s Distance","Feature Volume","Characteristic Volume","Volumetric Features","Volumetric Characteristics","1D Convolutional Layers","Image Inpainting","Plot Of Sensitivity","Generative Adversarial Networks Training","Small Resolution","User Selection","Gaussian Mixture Model"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2834341","title":"Bridging Text Visualization and Mining: A Task-Driven Survey","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"7","issn":"2160-9306","rank":96,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Tsinghua University, Beijing, P.

Each textual snippet shows a content summary of the referred document (or webpage) and a link to it. This display has many advantages, for example, it affords easy navigation and is straightforward to interpret. Nonetheless, any user of search engines could possibly report some experience of disappointment with this metaphor. Indeed, it has limitations in particular situations, as it fails to provide an overview of the document collection retrieved. Moreover, depending on the nature of the query for example, it may be too general, or ambiguous, or ill expressed the desired information may be poorly ranked, or results may contemplate varied topics. Several search tasks would be easier if users were shown an overview of the returned documents, organized so as to reflect how related they are, content wise. We propose a visualization technique to display the results of web queries aimed at overcoming such limitations. It combines the neighborhood preservation capability of multidimensional projections with the familiar snippet-based representation by employing a multidimensional projection to derive two-dimensional layouts of the query search results that preserve text similarity relations, or neighborhoods. Similarity is computed by applying the cosine similarity over a \"bag-of-wordsâ' vector representation of collection built from the snippets. If the snippets are displayed directly according to the derived layout, they will overlap considerably, producing a poor visualization. We overcome this problem by defining an energy functional that considers both the overlapping among snippets and the preservation of the neighborhood structure as given in the projected layout. Minimizing this energy functional provides a neighborhood preserving two-dimensional arrangement of the textual snippets with minimum overlap. The resulting visualization conveys both a global view of the query results and visual groupings that reflect related results, as illustrated in several examples shown.","article_number":"6629989","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6629989","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6629989/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6629989/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6777146,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"March 2014","start_page":"457","end_page":"470","citing_paper_count":53,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":1649,"insert_date":"20131011","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Layout","Search engines","Vectors","Optimization","Web pages","Navigation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Multidimensional projection","web search visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Search Engine","Searchable","Web Search","Search Results","Web Search Results","Navigation","Energy Function","Visualization Techniques","Ranked List","Search Task","Neighborhood Structure","Neighboring Structures","Query Results","Search For Sites","Search Engine Queries","Web Queries","Web Search Queries","View Of The Results","View Of Outcomes","Rectangular","Rectangle","Data Pre-processing","Video Games","Computer Games","Left Corner","Cloud Data","Word Cloud","Low Computational Cost","Term Frequency","Visual Space","Text Query","Nearest Neighbor Graph","Visual Resources","Game Consoles","Video Game Consoles","Neighborhood Relationship","Neighbourhood Relations","Neighbourly Relations","Neighbor Relationship","Usability Evaluation","Usability Ratings","Mathematical Terms","Query Terms","Lower Cut","Graph Layout","Graph Drawing"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.150","title":"Similarity Measures for Enhancing Interactive Streamline Seeding","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"8","issn":"2160-9306","rank":98,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Visual Computing Group, Department of Computer Science, Swansea University, Swansea, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37062012800","id":37062012800,"full_name":"Tony McLoughlin","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Computing Group, Department of Computer Science, Swansea University, Swansea, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Visual Computing Group, Department of Computer Science, Swansea University, Swansea, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37335785800","id":37335785800,"full_name":"Mark W.

We present new approaches for calculating similarity between integral curves (streamlines and pathlines). While others have used similarity distance measures, the computational expense involved with existing techniques is relatively high due to the vast number of euclidean distance tests, restricting interactivity and their use for streamline seeding rakes. We introduce the novel idea of computing streamline signatures based on a set of curve-based attributes. A signature produces a compact representation for describing a streamline. Similarity comparisons are performed by using a popular statistical measure on the derived signatures. We demonstrate that this novel scheme, including a hierarchical variant, produces good clustering results and is computed over two orders of magnitude faster than previous methods. Similarity-based clustering enables filtering of the streamlines to provide a nonuniform seeding distribution along the seeding object. We show that this method preserves the overall flow behavior while using only a small subset of the original streamline set. We apply focus + context rendering using the clusters which allows for faster and easier analysis in cases of high visual complexity and occlusion. The method provides a high level of interactivity and allows the user to easily fine tune the clustering results at runtime while avoiding any time-consuming recomputation. Our method maintains interactive rates even when hundreds of streamlines are used.","article_number":"6231627","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6231627","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6231627/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6231627/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6530578,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Aug. 2013","start_page":"1342","end_page":"1353","citing_paper_count":49,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1024,"insert_date":"20120703","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Measurement","Visualization","Streaming media","Clustering algorithms","Vectors","Data visualization","Context"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Flow visualization","clustering","similarity measures","focus+context","streamlines"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive","Similarity Measure","Similarity Metrics","Distancing Measures","Number Of Tests","Clustering Results","Vector Field","Flow Behavior","Surface Integrity","Solution Curve","Integral Curves","Computational Expense","Expensive Calculations","Visual Complexity","Pathlines","Set Of Values","Parameter Space","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Similarity Matrix","Similarity Matrices","Domain Experts","Levels Of Hierarchy","Steady Flow","Unsteady Flow","Tortuosity","Hierarchical Approach","Number Of Streamlines","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Agglomerative Clustering","Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering","Large Aspect Ratio","Tidal Energy","Hydrokinetic","Tidal Power","Tidal Turbine","Power-of-two","Weather Research And Forecasting","Examples In This Paper","Distance Metrics","Visual Aids"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.259","title":"Streamline Integration Using MPI-Hybrid Parallelism on a Large Multicore Architecture","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"11","issn":"2160-9306","rank":99,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604571800","id":37604571800,"full_name":"David Camp","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282573700","id":37282573700,"full_name":"Christoph Garth","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37411882800","id":37411882800,"full_name":"Hank Childs","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37394779900","id":37394779900,"full_name":"David Pugmire","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267811400","id":37267811400,"full_name":"Kenneth Joy","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Streamline computation in a very large vector field data set represents a significant challenge due to the nonlocal and data-dependent nature of streamline integration.

To achieve this aim, we propose a new information-theoretic approach that automatically selects the most informative voxels from two volume data sets. Our fusion criteria are based on the information channel created between the two input data sets that permit us to quantify the information associated with each intensity value. This specific information is obtained from three different ways of decomposing the mutual information of the channel. In addition, an assessment criterion based on the information content of the fused data set can be used to analyze and modify the initial selection of the voxels by weighting the contribution of each data set to the final result. The proposed approach has been integrated in a general framework that allows for the exploration of volumetric data models and the interactive change of some parameters of the fused data set. The proposed approach has been evaluated on different medical data sets with very promising results.","article_number":"6095545","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6095545","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6095545/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6095545/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6238449,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Sept. 2012","start_page":"1574","end_page":"1587","citing_paper_count":45,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":2569,"insert_date":"20111206","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Transfer functions","Data visualization","Rendering (computer graphics)","Mutual information","Biomedical imaging","Image color analysis","Data models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Multimodal visualization","image fusion","information theory","mutual information."]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Mutual Information","Data Fusion","Intensity Values","Volume Values","Information Theory","Information-theoretic","Assessment Criteria","Medical Datasets","Volume Dataset","Volume Data Sets","Results Of Method","Transfer Function","Model Input","Input Values","Computed Tomography Images","Information Model","Supplementary Material Online","Positron Emission Tomography Imaging","Pairs Of Values","Fusion Method","Fusion Technology","Multimodal Imaging","3D Visualization","T1 Images","T2 Images","Ray Casting","Ray Shooting","Fusion Strategy","Fusion Scheme","Volume Rendering","Volumetric Rendering","Image X","Extraocular Muscles","Eye Muscle","Multidimensional Function","Multidimensional Map","Model Resolution","Measurement Values","Computer Graphics"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2014.62","title":"From Data to Insight: Work Practices of Analysts in the Enterprise","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"5","issn":"1558-1756","rank":102,"volume":"34","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"IBM Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37269701600","id":37269701600,"full_name":"Eser Kandogan","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IBM Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Google","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085457832","id":37085457832,"full_name":"Aruna Balakrishnan","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Google"]}},{"affiliation":"IBM Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37388973300","id":37388973300,"full_name":"Eben M.

The main challenge for effective streamline visualization lies in seed placement, i.e., where to drop seeds and how many seeds should be placed. Seeding too many or too few streamlines may not reveal flow features and patterns either because it easily leads to visual clutter in rendering or it conveys little information about the flow field. Not only does the number of streamlines placed matter, their spatial relationships also play a key role in understanding the flow field. Therefore, effective flow visualization requires the streamlines to be placed in the right place and in the right amount. This paper introduces hierarchical streamline bundles, a novel approach to simplifying and visualizing 3D flow fields defined on regular grids. By placing seeds and generating streamlines according to flow saliency, we produce a set of streamlines that captures important flow features near critical points without enforcing the dense seeding condition. We group spatially neighboring and geometrically similar streamlines to construct a hierarchy from which we extract streamline bundles at different levels of detail. Streamline bundles highlight multiscale flow features and patterns through clustered yet not cluttered display. This selective visualization strategy effectively reduces visual clutter while accentuating visual foci, and therefore is able to convey the desired insight into the flow data.","article_number":"6025348","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6025348","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6025348/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6025348/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6214949,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Aug. 2012","start_page":"1353","end_page":"1367","citing_paper_count":39,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1083,"insert_date":"20110923","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three dimensional displays","Streaming media","Feature extraction","Data visualization","Clustering algorithms","Visualization","Diffusion tensor imaging"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Streamline bundles","flow saliency","seed placement","hierarchical clustering","level-of-detail","flow visualization."]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Critical Point","Flow Patterns","Flow Field","Flow Characteristics","Flow Features","Flow Visualization","3D Flow","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Number Of Streamlines","Hierarchical Clustering","Hierarchical Cluster Analysis","Diffusion Tensor Imaging","Diffusion-weighted Imaging","Diffusion Tensor","Grid Cells","Mean Distance","Clustering Results","Vector Field","Flow Structure","Agglomerative Clustering","Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering","Clustering Tree","Hierarchical Algorithm","Binary Tree","Map Points","Saliency Map","Field Curves","Salient Regions","Closest Distance","Van Wijk","Balance Method","Flow Dataset","Flow Data Sets","Original Field","Cluster Boundaries","Complex Flow"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2859973","title":"Commercial Visual Analytics Systems–Advances in the Big Data Analytics Field","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"10","issn":"2160-9306","rank":104,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38551542600","id":38551542600,"full_name":"Michael Behrisch","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085610904","id":37085610904,"full_name":"Dirk Streeb","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233603600","id":38233603600,"full_name":"Florian Stoffel","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085831457","id":37085831457,"full_name":"Daniel Seebacher","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085684511","id":37085684511,"full_name":"Brian Matejek","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Siemens AG, Corporate Research Germany, Munich, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086725010","id":37086725010,"full_name":"Stefan Hagen Weber","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Siemens AG, Corporate Research Germany, Munich, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Siemens AG, Corporate Research Germany, Munich, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38579710900","id":38579710900,"full_name":"Sebastian Mittelstädt","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Siemens AG, Corporate Research Germany, Munich, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275698100","id":37275698100,"full_name":"Hanspeter Pfister","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","id":37283138700,"full_name":"Daniel Keim","author_order":9,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Five years after the first state-of-the-art report on Commercial Visual Analytics Systems we present a reevaluation of the Big Data Analytics field.

We evaluate new product versions on established evaluation criteria, such as available features, performance, and usability, to extend on and assure comparability with the previous survey. We also investigate previously unavailable products to paint a more complete picture of the commercial VA landscape. Furthermore, we introduce novel measures, like suitability for specific user groups and the ability to handle complex data types, and undertake a new case study to highlight innovative features.

Two orthogonal axes are used: one for all nodes of the displayed graph, the other for the corresponding links. Colors and labels are employed to identify the nodes. The usage of color allows us to scale the visualization to single pixel level for large graphs. In contrast to other techniques, we employ an asymmetric mapping that results in an aligned and compact representation of links. Our approach is independent of the specific properties of the graph to be visualized, but certain graphs and tasks benefit from the asymmetry. As we show in our results, the strength of our technique is the visualization of dynamic graphs. In particular, sparse graphs benefit from the compact representation. Furthermore, our approach uses visual encoding by size to represent weights and therefore allows easy quantification and comparison. We evaluate our approach in a quantitative user study that confirms the suitability for dynamic and weighted graphs. Finally, we demonstrate our approach for two examples of dynamic graphs.","article_number":"6812198","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6812198","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6812198/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6812198/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6909091,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"1 Nov. 2014","start_page":"1590","end_page":"1603","citing_paper_count":33,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1428,"insert_date":"20140508","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Graph theory","Image color analysis","Encoding","Data visualization","Scalability"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Graph visualization","weighted graphs","dynamic graphs","adjacency lists"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Dynamic Graph","Adjacency List","Visual Representation","User Study","Visibility Graph","Compact Representation","Large Graphs","Sparse Graph","Visual Encoding","Time Step","Time Span","Migration Rate","Color Code","Visualization Techniques","Weak Connections","Connectivity Graph","Source Node","Target Node","Graph Size","Light Box","Temporal Clustering","Incoming Links","Backlink","Inbound Links","Small Graphs","Weight Map","Interaction Techniques","Link Weights","Static Graph","Link Density","Visual Metaphors","Part Of Future Work","Color Map"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2790961","title":"Graph Thumbnails: Identifying and Comparing Multiple Graphs at a Glance","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":107,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085607171","id":37085607171,"full_name":"Vahan Yoghourdjian","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37326161000","id":37326161000,"full_name":"Tim Dwyer","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085462754","id":37085462754,"full_name":"Karsten Klein","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37354163600","id":37354163600,"full_name":"Kim Marriott","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37867777700","id":37867777700,"full_name":"Michael Wybrow","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We propose Graph Thumbnails, small icon-like visualisations of the high-level structure of network data.

In this paper, we describe the computational challenges in building a real-time visual exploratory tool for finding top-ranked objects; build on the recent work involving in-memory and rank-aware data cubes to propose TopKube: a data structure that answers top-k queries up to one order of magnitude faster than the previous state of the art; demonstrate the usefulness of our methods using a set of real-world, publicly available datasets; and provide a new set of benchmarks for other researchers to validate their methods and compare to our own.","article_number":"7858782","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7858782","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7858782/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7858782/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8272049,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"1 March 2018","start_page":"1394","end_page":"1407","citing_paper_count":32,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1183,"insert_date":"20170217","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Data structures","Proposals","Real-time systems","Benchmark testing","Urban areas"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Interactive visualization","data cube","top-K queries","rank merging"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Exploratory Data","Data Cube","Datacube","Data Structure","State Of The Art","State-of-the-art","Specific Properties","Specific Attributes","Specific Dimensions","Additional Measures","Key Properties","Key Attributes","Key Dimensions","Left Corner","Measures Of Interest","Threshold Algorithm","Multidimensional Model","Hybrid Algorithm","Interactive Exploration","Binary Search","Number Of Keywords","Query Time","Input List","Number Of Keys","Naive Algorithm","Set Of Bins","Ranking Information","Percentage Of Instances","User-generated Data","Spatial Bins","Low Latency","Problem Instances","Temporal Dimension","Time Dimension","Temporal Properties","GitHub Projects","Slow Down","Problems In Group"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.315","title":"Perceptually Driven Visibility Optimization for Categorical Data Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"10","issn":"2160-9306","rank":109,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073205000","id":37073205000,"full_name":"Sungkil Lee","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Sektion 1.5, Geoinformatik Telegrafenberg, Helmholtz Centre Potsdam, German Research Centre for GeoScience GFZ, Potsdam, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37827860500","id":37827860500,"full_name":"Mike Sips","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sektion 1.5, Geoinformatik Telegrafenberg, Helmholtz Centre Potsdam, German Research Centre for GeoScience GFZ, Potsdam, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Max-Planck-Institut für Informatik, Saarbrucken, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271851300","id":37271851300,"full_name":"Hans-Peter Seidel","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Max-Planck-Institut für Informatik, Saarbrucken, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Visualization techniques often use color to present categorical differences to a user.

We present a color optimization algorithm based on our class visibility metric to make categorical differences clearly visible to the user.

Although these methods improve spatial perception of individual lines or related sets of lines, they do not solve the problem for complex spatial relations between dense bundles of lines.

Furthermore, we propose an importance measure that combines the spatial persistence of a critical point with its temporal evolution. This leads to a time-aware feature hierarchy, which allows us to discriminate important from spurious features. Our method requires only a single, easy-to-tune computational parameter and is naturally formulated in an out-of-core fashion, which enables the analysis of large data sets.

However, streamgraph as well as ThemeRiver suffer from scalability problems when dealing with several time series. To solve this problem, multiple time series can be organized into a hierarchical structure where individual time series are grouped hierarchically according to their proximity.

However, some practical issues--such as ambiguity, lack of detailed distribution information, and a large number of false positives--affect the application of entropy-based traffic anomaly detection. In this work, we introduce a visual analytic tool called ENTVis to help users understand entropy-based traffic metrics and achieve accurate traffic anomaly detection. ENTVis provides three coordinated views and rich interactions to support a coherent visual analysis on multiple perspectives: the timeline group view for perceiving situations and finding hints of anomalies, the Radviz view for clustering similar anomalies in a period, and the matrix view for understanding traffic distributions and diagnosing anomalies in detail. Several case studies have been performed to verify the usability and effectiveness of our method. A further evaluation was conducted via expert review.","article_number":"7274260","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7274260","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7274260/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7274260/","publication_title":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","publication_number":38,"is_number":7331155,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2015","start_page":"42","end_page":"50","citing_paper_count":26,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":1370,"insert_date":"20150923","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Ports (Computers)","Entropy","IP networks","Human computer interaction","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Telecommunication traffic"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["computer graphics","visual analytics","cybersecurity","entropy","anomaly detection"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visualization Tool","Anomaly Detection","Urban Network","Traffic Network","Visual Analytics Tool","Traffic Anomaly","Traffic Anomaly Detection","Time Series","Expert Review","Detailed Distribution","Traffic Volume","Traffic Intensity","Out-degree","Denial Of Service","Denial-of-service Attacks","Attack Detection","Onset Detection","Traffic Patterns","Traffic Information","Candidate Detection","Traffic Characteristics","Traffic Features","Distributed Denial Of Service","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Time Span","Around A Circle","Circumference Of A Circle","Perimeter Of A Circle","Discrete Random Variable","Enterprise Network","Cluster A","Cluster C","Traffic Flow","Vehicular Traffic","Traffic Speed","Clustering Visualization","Web Server","Subclusters"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2498554","title":"Visual Analysis of Multi-Run Spatio-Temporal Simulations Using Isocontour Similarity for Projected Views","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"8","issn":"2160-9306","rank":117,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Jacobs University, Bremen, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085793690","id":37085793690,"full_name":"Alexey Fofonov","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Jacobs University, Bremen, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Jacobs University, Bremen, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085799395","id":37085799395,"full_name":"Vladimir Molchanov","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Jacobs University, Bremen, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Jacobs University, Bremen, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266826500","id":37266826500,"full_name":"Lars Linsen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Jacobs University, Bremen, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Multi-run simulations are widely used to investigate how simulated processes evolve depending on varying initial conditions. Frequently, such simulations model the change of spatial phenomena over time. Isocontours have proven to be effective for the visual representation and analysis of 2D and 3D spatial scalar fields. We propose a novel visualization approach for multi-run simulation data based on isocontours. By introducing a distance function for isocontours, we generate a distance matrix used for a multidimensional scaling projection. Multiple simulation runs are represented by polylines in the projected view displaying change over time. We propose a fast calculation of isocontour differences based on a quasi-Monte Carlo approach. For interactive visual analysis, we support filtering and selection mechanisms on the multi-run plot and on linked views to physical space visualizations. Our approach can be effectively used for the visual representation of ensembles, for pattern and outlier detection, for the investigation of the influence of simulation parameters, and for a detailed analysis of the features detected. The proposed method is applicable to data of any spatial dimensionality and any spatial representation (gridded or unstructured). We validate our approach by performing a user study on synthetic data and applying it to different types of multi-run spatio-temporal simulation data.","article_number":"7321821","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7321821","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7321821/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7321821/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7501980,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"1 Aug. 2016","start_page":"2037","end_page":"2050","citing_paper_count":26,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1017,"insert_date":"20151106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Computational modeling","Visualization","Data visualization","Data models","Analytical models","Shape","Three-dimensional displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Ensemble visualization","multi-run data visualization","spatio-temporal data visualization","isocontours"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Simulation Analysis","Visual Analysis","Interaction Analysis","Distance Matrix","Distance Matrices","Distance Function","Influence Of Parameters","Visual Representation","User Study","Spatial Dimensions","Spatial Attributes","Simulation Run","Visual Approach","Spatiotemporal Data","Polyline","Time Step","Mutual Information","Central Domain","Domain Experts","Distance Calculation","Distance Computation","Random Points","Isosurface","Distance Matrix Calculation","Calculated Distance Matrices","Distance Matrix Computation","Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics","Similar Plots","Spatial Visualization","Unstructured Data","Unstructured Information","3D Plots","Distance Plot","Different Fields Of Science","Similarity Map","Conical Tip"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.128","title":"Coherent Time-Varying Graph Drawing with Multifocus+Context Interaction","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"8","issn":"2160-9306","rank":118,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics Group/Visual System Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38247399600","id":38247399600,"full_name":"Kun-Chuan Feng","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics Group/Visual System Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37405886900","id":37405886900,"full_name":"Chaoli Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279493500","id":37279493500,"full_name":"Han-Wei Shen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics Group/Visual System Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37277268400","id":37277268400,"full_name":"Tong-Yee Lee","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics Group/Visual System Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present a new approach for time-varying graph drawing that achieves both spatiotemporal coherence and multifocus+context visualization in a single framework.

We adopt the concept of the super graph to maintain spatiotemporal coherence and further balance the needs for aesthetic quality and dynamic stability when interacting with time-varying graphs through focus+context visualization. Our method is particularly useful for multifocus+context visualization of time-varying graphs where we can preserve the mental map by preventing nodes in the focus from undergoing abrupt changes in size and location in the time sequence.

Similarly, users are faster and more accurate in selecting bundles using the 2D path representation than the 2D point representation.

We achieve this abstraction by analyzing the local similarity of tract segment directions at different scales using a stepwise increase of the search range. Next, locally similar tract segments are moved toward each other in an iterative process, resulting in a local contraction of tracts perpendicular to the local tract direction at a given scale. This not only leads to the abstraction of the global structure of the white matter as represented by the tracts, but also creates volumetric voids. This increase of empty space decreases the mutual occlusion of tracts and, consequently, results in a better understanding of the brain's three-dimensional fiber tract structure. Our implementation supports an interactive and continuous transition between the original and the abstracted representations via various scale levels of similarity. We also support the selection of groups of tracts, which are highlighted and rendered with the abstracted visualization as context.","article_number":"7042344","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042344","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042344/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042344/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7112593,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"1 July 2015","start_page":"808","end_page":"821","citing_paper_count":22,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":575,"insert_date":"20150213","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Diffusion tensor imaging","Visualization","Data visualization","Tensile stress","Vectors","Nerve fibers","Abstracts"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)","fiber tracts","visual abstraction","multi-scale representation","illustrative visualization","Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)","fiber tracts","visual abstraction","multi-scale representation","illustrative visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["White Matter","Fiber Tracts","Fiber Pathways","White Matter Structures","Visual Abstract","Interactive","Iterative Process","Structural Materials","Similar Position","Local Similarity","Diffusion Tensor Imaging","Diffusion-weighted Imaging","Diffusion Tensor","Scale Level","Abstract Representations","Pathways In Group","Tract Group","Diffusion Tensor Imaging Data","Focus Group","Corpus Callosum","Callose","Original Position","Original Location","Infographic","Graphical Display","Fiber Bundles","Displacement Vector","Contracted State","Number Of Tracts","Contraction Process","Muscle Contraction Processes","Similarity Graph","Fiber Contraction","Graph Generation","Years Of Professional Experience","Tractography","Tract Length","Pathway Length","Vertex Position","Positions Of Vertices"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2808489","title":"ColorMapND: A Data-Driven Approach and Tool for Mapping Multivariate Data to Color","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"2160-9306","rank":125,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085387617","id":37085387617,"full_name":"Shenghui Cheng","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085905011","id":37085905011,"full_name":"Wei Xu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273119700","id":37273119700,"full_name":"Klaus Mueller","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"A wide variety of color schemes have been devised for mapping scalar data to color. We address the challenge of color-mapping multivariate data. While a number of methods can map low-dimensional data to color, for example, using bilinear or barycentric interpolation for two or three variables, these methods do not scale to higher data dimensions. Likewise, schemes that take a more artistic approach through color mixing and the like also face limits when it comes to the number of variables they can encode. Our approach does not have these limitations. It is data driven in that it determines a proper and consistent color map from first embedding the data samples into a circular interactive multivariate color mapping display (ICD) and then fusing this display with a convex (CIE HCL) color space. The variables (data attributes) are arranged in terms of their similarity and mapped to the ICD's boundary to control the embedding. Using this layout, the color of a multivariate data sample is then obtained via modified generalized barycentric coordinate interpolation of the map. The system we devised has facilities for contrast and feature enhancement, supports both regular and irregular grids, can deal with multi-field as well as multispectral data, and can produce heat maps, choropleth maps, and diagrams such as scatterplots.","article_number":"8302605","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8302605","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8302605/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8302605/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8594686,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"1 Feb. 2019","start_page":"1361","end_page":"1377","citing_paper_count":22,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1149,"insert_date":"20180226","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image color analysis","Interpolation","Data visualization","Tools","Aerospace electronics","Principal component analysis","Hyperspectral imaging"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Multivariate data","color mapping","color space","high dimensional data","pseudo coloring"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Multivariate Data","Multivariate Statistics","Interactive","Contrast Agent","Contrast Enhancement","Contrast Medium","Regular Grid","Cartesian Grid","Grid Structure","Rectangular Grid","Color Space","Colour Space","Color Components","Color Map","Colour Map","Colormap","Color Scheme","Colour Scheme","Multispectral Data","Choropleth Maps","Color Images","Colour Images","Extraversion","Extroversion","Vector Of Length","RGB Images","Multispectral Images","Multispectral Imagery","Channel Images","Group Of Scientists","Image Domain","Interior Point","Interior-point","Distinct Color","Distinct Colour","Local Enhancement","HSV Color","HSV Color Space","Hue, Saturation, Value","Hue-saturation-value","Color Palette","Colour Palette","Primary Colors","Primary Colours","White Point","Circular Boundary","Color Enhancement","Colour Enhancement","Data Embedding","Locally Linear Embedding","Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction","Image Pixels"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.265","title":"Glyph-Based Video Visualization for Semen Analysis","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"8","issn":"2160-9306","rank":126,"volume":"21","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Oxford eResearch Center (OeRC), University of Oxford, Oxford, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37428381900","id":37428381900,"full_name":"Brian Duffy","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oxford eResearch Center (OeRC), University of Oxford, Oxford, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom"]}},{"affiliation":"Oxford eResearch Center (OeRC), University of Oxford, Oxford, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37828989700","id":37828989700,"full_name":"Jeyarajan Thiyagalingam","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oxford eResearch Center (OeRC), University of Oxford, Oxford, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom"]}},{"affiliation":"Oxford eResearch Center (OeRC), University of Oxford, Oxford, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085549160","id":37085549160,"full_name":"Simon Walton","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oxford eResearch Center (OeRC), University of Oxford, Oxford, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom"]}},{"affiliation":"Watson Building, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, United Kingdom","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086209257","id":37086209257,"full_name":"David J.

This results in a large amount of data, and it is extremely challenging for both clinical scientists and researchers to interpret, compare and correlate the multidimensional and time-varying measurements captured from video data. In this work, we use glyphs to encode a collection of numerical measurements taken at a regular interval and to summarize spatio-temporal motion characteristics using static visual representations. The design of the glyphs addresses the needs for (a) encoding some 20 variables using separable visual channels, (b) supporting scientific observation of the interrelationships between different measurements and comparison between different sperm cells and their flagella, and (c) facilitating the learning of the encoding scheme by making use of appropriate visual abstractions and metaphors. As a case study, we focus this work on video visualization for computer-aided semen analysis, which has a broad impact on both biological sciences and medical healthcare. We demonstrate that glyph-based visualization can serve as a means of external memorization of video data as well as an overview of a large set of spatiotemporal measurements. It enables domain scientists to make scientific observation in a cost-effective manner by reducing the burden of viewing videos repeatedly, while providing them with a new visual representation for conveying semen statistics.","article_number":"6684146","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6684146","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6684146/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6684146/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7138666,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"Aug. 2015","start_page":"980","end_page":"993","citing_paper_count":22,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1184,"insert_date":"20131213","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Context","Head","Educational institutions","Electronic mail"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Video visualization","glyph visualization","multivariate data","semen analysis","flagellum locomotion"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Semen Analysis","Sperm Analysis","Image Analysis","Metaphor","Visual Representation","Video Data","Collection Of Measures","Motion Features","Motion Characteristics","Visual Channels","Specific Domains","Multivariate Data","Multivariate Statistics","Domain Experts","Spatial Context","Color Map","Pendulum","Visualization Techniques","Arc Length","Curve Length","Acrosome","Sperm Head","Instantaneous Velocity","Semen Samples","Visual Design","Kinematic Measures","Time Series Plots","Total Torque","Sperm Whales","Swimming Patterns","Sperm Tail","Sperm Flagella","Parallel Coordinates","Design Options","Multivariate Measure","Number Of Challenges"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2015.69","title":"Design Challenges and Opportunities for Eco-Feedback in the Home","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"4","issn":"1558-1756","rank":127,"volume":"35","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Simon Fraser University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37353447100","id":37353447100,"full_name":"Lyn Bartram","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Simon Fraser University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Magazines","abstract":"Domestic energy conservation is critical to reducing energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions.

However, users may want to focus on important nodes and their connections to groups of other nodes for some applications. For this purpose, it is effective to separately visualize the key nodes detected based on adjacency and attributes of the nodes. This article presents a graph visualization technique for attribute-embedded graphs that applies a graph-clustering algorithm that accounts for the combination of connections and attributes. The graph clustering step divides the nodes according to the commonality of connected nodes and similarity of feature value vectors. It then calculates the distances between arbitrary pairs of clusters according to the number of connecting edges and the similarity of feature value vectors and finally places the clusters based on the distances. Consequently, the technique separates important nodes that have connections to multiple large clusters and improves the visibility of such nodes' connections. To test this technique, this article presents examples with human relationship graph datasets, including a coauthorship and Twitter communication network dataset.","article_number":"7274247","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7274247","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7274247/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7274247/","publication_title":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","publication_number":38,"is_number":7331155,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2015","start_page":"30","end_page":"40","citing_paper_count":17,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":802,"insert_date":"20150923","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Clustering algorithms","Human computer interaction","Data visualization","Image color analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Graphical user interfaces"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["computer graphics","graph clustering","graph layout","human relationship graph"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visibility Graph","Graph Layout","Graph Drawing","Pair Of Nodes","Nodes In The Graph","Node Positions","Location Of Nodes","Key Nodes","Tight Connection","Node Attributes","Nodal Properties","Cluster Position","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Subset Of People","Social Networks Of People","First Author","Lead Author","Large Clusters","Largest Value","Small Clusters","Shortest Path","Red Circles","Graph Structure","Important Nodes","Cluster Nodes","Blue Nodes","Red Nodes","Node Color","Vertex Position","Positions Of Vertices","Twitter Users","Use Of Twitter","Pair Of Clusters","Title Of The Paper","Typical Distance","Agglomerative Clustering Algorithm"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2016.49","title":"VisAdapt: A Visualization Tool to Support Climate Change Adaptation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"1558-1756","rank":131,"volume":"37","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Linköping University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273045500","id":37273045500,"full_name":"Jimmy Johansson","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Linköping University"]}},{"affiliation":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085399103","id":37085399103,"full_name":"Tomasz Opach","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Norwegian University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Linköping University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085392843","id":37085392843,"full_name":"Erik Glaas","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Linköping University"]}},{"affiliation":"Linköping University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546931700","id":37546931700,"full_name":"Tina-Simone Neset","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Linköping University"]}},{"affiliation":"Linköping University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085397322","id":37085397322,"full_name":"Carlo Navarra","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Linköping University"]}},{"affiliation":"Linköping University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546932100","id":37546932100,"full_name":"Björn-Ola Linnér","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Linköping University"]}},{"affiliation":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology, University of Agder","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086116707","id":37086116707,"full_name":"Jan Ketil Rød","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Norwegian University of Science and Technology, University of Agder"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Magazines","abstract":"The web-based visualization VisAdapt tool was developed to help laypeople in the Nordic countries assess how anticipated climate change will impact their homes.

For example, a movie may be associated with multiple genres with different levels of confidence. Despite their ubiquity, the problem of visualizing probabilistic labels has not been adequately addressed. Existing approaches often either discard the probabilistic information, or map the data to a low-dimensional subspace where their associations with original labels are obscured. In this paper, we propose a novel visual technique, UnTangle Map, for visualizing probabilistic multi-labels. In our proposed visualization, data items are placed inside a web of connected triangles, with labels assigned to the triangle vertices such that nearby labels are more relevant to each other. The positions of the data items are determined based on the probabilistic associations between items and labels. UnTangle Map provides both (a) an automatic label placement algorithm, and (b) adaptive interactions that allow users to control the label positioning for different information needs. Our work makes a unique contribution by providing an effective way to investigate the relationship between data items and their probabilistic labels, as well as the relationships among labels. Our user study suggests that the visualization effectively helps users discover emergent patterns and compare the nuances of probabilistic information in the data labels.","article_number":"7091015","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7091015","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7091015/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7091015/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7368227,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"1 Feb. 2016","start_page":"1149","end_page":"1163","citing_paper_count":16,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":1277,"insert_date":"20150421","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Probabilistic logic","Visualization","Layout","Distributed databases","Motion pictures","Data models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Multidimensional Visualization","Probability Vector","Visualization","multidimensional visualization","probability vector"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Probability Of Data","User Study","Labeled Data","Visualization Techniques","Multiple Labels","Label Probability","Pairwise Correlations","Pairwise Correlation Coefficients","Multidimensional Data","Multidimensional Analysis","Real-world Datasets","Low-dimensional Space","Lower-dimensional Space","Topic Modeling","Level Of Granularity","Number Of Labels","Field Of Machine Learning","Labeled Data Set","Labels In Dataset","Triangular Mesh","Triangle Mesh","Latent Dirichlet Allocation","Visual Design","Fuzzy Clustering","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Ternary Plot","Scatterplot Matrix","Scatterplot Matrices","Item Probabilities","Parallel Coordinates","Different Levels Of Granularity","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Objective Function","Position Of Point","Probability Vector","Stochastic Vector","Interactive"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2834923","title":"Classification of Blood Flow Patterns in Cerebral Aneurysms","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"7","issn":"2160-9306","rank":133,"volume":"25","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Simulation and Graphics, University of Magdeburg, and Research Campus STIMULATE, Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085898826","id":37085898826,"full_name":"Monique Meuschke","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Simulation and Graphics, University of Magdeburg, and Research Campus STIMULATE, Magdeburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085591751","id":37085591751,"full_name":"Steffen Oeltze-Jafra","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University Hospital of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017002900","id":38017002900,"full_name":"Oliver Beuing","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University Hospital of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Simulation and Graphics, University of Magdeburg, and Research Campus STIMULATE, Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37424645300","id":37424645300,"full_name":"Bernhard Preim","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Simulation and Graphics, University of Magdeburg, and Research Campus STIMULATE, Magdeburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Koblenz-Landau, Mainz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085527253","id":37085527253,"full_name":"Kai Lawonn","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Koblenz-Landau, Mainz, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present a Cerebral Aneurysm Vortex Classification (CAVOCLA) that allows to classify blood flow in cerebral aneurysms. Medical studies assume a strong relation between the progression and rupture of aneurysms and flow patterns. To understand how flow patterns impact the vessel morphology, they are manually classified according to predefined classes. However, manual classifications are time-consuming and exhibit a high inter-observer variability. In contrast, our approach is more objective and faster than manual methods. The classification of integral lines, representing steady or unsteady blood flow, is based on a mapping of the aneurysm surface to a hemisphere by calculating polar-based coordinates. The lines are clustered and for each cluster a representative is calculated. Then, the polar-based coordinates are transformed to the representative as basis for the classification. Classes are based on the flow complexity. The classification results are presented by a detail-on-demand approach using a visual transition from the representative over an enclosing surface to the associated lines. Based on seven representative datasets, we conduct an informal interview with five domain experts to evaluate the system. They confirmed that CAVOCLA allows for a robust classification of intra-aneurysmal flow patterns. The detail-on-demand visualization enables an efficient exploration and interpretation of flow patterns.","article_number":"8359417","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8359417","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8359417/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8359417/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8723245,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"1 July 2019","start_page":"2404","end_page":"2418","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":741,"insert_date":"20180515","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Aneurysm","Blood","Visualization","Surface morphology","Data visualization","Hemodynamics","Two dimensional displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Medical visualizations","aneurysms","blood flow","parametrization","classification"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Blood Flow","Hemodynamic","Haemodynamic","Flow Patterns","Pattern Classification","Cerebral Aneurysms","Classification Results","Domain Experts","Steady Flow","Unsteady Flow","Manual Classification","Manual Categorization","High Inter-observer Variability","Streamline","Similar Types","Flow Data","Shortest Distance","Cardiac Cycle","Quantitative Parameters","Flow Behavior","Flow Behaviour","Typical Flow","Agglomerative Clustering","Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering","Cluster Representatives","Wall Shear Stress","Pathlines","Zoom Level","Iterative Closest Point","Geodesic Distance","Impact Zone","Impingement Zone","Fusiform Aneurysms","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Aneurysm Growth","Hitting The Wall"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2015.25","title":"Knowledge-Assisted Ranking: A Visual Analytic Application for Sports Event Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"1558-1756","rank":134,"volume":"36","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Swansea University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38022083900","id":38022083900,"full_name":"David H.S.

Automated methods can be useful to some extent but bringing the data analyst into the loop via interactive visual tools can help the discovery process tremendously. An inherent problem in this effort is that humans lack the mental capacity to truly understand spaces exceeding three spatial dimensions. To keep within this limitation, we describe a framework that decomposes a high-dimensional data space into a continuum of generalized 3D subspaces. Analysts can then explore these 3D subspaces individually via the familiar trackball interface while using additional facilities to smoothly transition to adjacent subspaces for expanded space comprehension. Since the number of such subspaces suffers from combinatorial explosion, we provide a set of data-driven subspace selection and navigation tools which can guide users to interesting subspaces and views. A subspace trail map allows users to manage the explored subspaces, keep their bearings, and return to interesting subspaces and views. Both trackball and trail map are each embedded into a word cloud of attribute labels which aid in navigation. We demonstrate our system via several use cases in a diverse set of application areas-cluster analysis and refinement, information discovery, and supervised training of classifiers. We also report on a user study that evaluates the usability of the various interactions our system provides.","article_number":"7862917","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7862917","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7862917/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7862917/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8241790,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"1 Feb. 2018","start_page":"1204","end_page":"1222","citing_paper_count":14,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":826,"insert_date":"20170223","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three-dimensional displays","Visualization","Space exploration","Two dimensional displays","Navigation","Cognition","Layout"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["High-dimensional data","subspace navigation","trackball","PCA","ant colony optimization1"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["3D Subspace","User Study","Interactive Tool","Scatter Plot","Dimensional Data","Dimensional Vector","Vector-based","Basis Vectors","Point Cloud","Point Clouds","Pheromone","Interesting Patterns","Pattern Of Involvement","Influence Of Properties","Influence Of Attributes","Influence Of Dimensions","Ant Colony Optimization","Projection Point","Orthogonal Basis","Control Panel","Higher Revenue","Higher Tax Revenues","Orthogonal Vectors","Principal Component Axes","Mouse Button","Basic Project","Subspace Clustering","Schmidt Orthogonalization","Gram-Schmidt Process","Gram-Schmidt Method","Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization","Left Mouse Button","Projection Matrix","Matrix Operations","Projection Matrices","Quality Metrics","Bottom Left","Vertical Bars","Vertical Pipe","Vert"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2017.21","title":"Visualizing Rank Time Series of Wikipedia Top-Viewed Pages","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"2","issn":"1558-1756","rank":136,"volume":"37","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085405113","id":37085405113,"full_name":"Jing Xia","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086043190","id":37086043190,"full_name":"Yumeng Hou","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38241087200","id":38241087200,"full_name":"Yingjie Victor Chen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38238364000","id":38238364000,"full_name":"Zhenyu Cheryl Qian","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282598900","id":37282598900,"full_name":"David S.

The authors believe this study will help guide future developers regarding the design of personal visualizations.","article_number":"7160902","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7160902","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7160902/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7160902/","publication_title":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","publication_number":38,"is_number":7160864,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"July-Aug. 2015","start_page":"82","end_page":"93","citing_paper_count":12,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1002,"insert_date":"20150716","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Facebook","Image color analysis","Visual analytics","Context modeling","Social network services"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["computer graphics","personal visualization","design study","Facebook data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Visualization","Personal Data","User Data","User Study","Visual Design","User Content","Subjective Point Of View","Design Style","Participant Data","Active Users","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Types Of Users","Online Activities","Use Of Different Types","Different Types Of Users","Angular Position","Angular Direction","User Engagement","Customer Engagement","Visual Properties","Visual Attributes","Think-aloud Protocols","Visual Metaphors"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2618797","title":"An Exploratory Study of Word-Scale Graphics in Data-Rich Text Documents","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"10","issn":"2160-9306","rank":138,"volume":"23","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Inria, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085438672","id":37085438672,"full_name":"Pascal Goffin","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Inria, France"]}},{"affiliation":"UN Global Pulse, New York, NY","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085379303","id":37085379303,"full_name":"Jeremy Boy","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UN Global Pulse, New York, NY"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945380800","id":37945380800,"full_name":"Wesley Willett","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"Inria, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591317800","id":37591317800,"full_name":"Petra Isenberg","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Inria, France"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We contribute an investigation of the design and function of word-scale graphics and visualizations embedded in text documents.

In the medical field, diagnoses of medical images have been studied with gaze tracking technology to understand how radiologists read medical images. While prior work were mainly based on diagnosis with a single image, recent work focused on diagnosis with consecutive cross-sectional medical images acquired from preoperative computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the diagnosis, radiologists scroll through a stack of images to get a 3D cognition of organs and lesions. Thus, it is important to understand radiologists' gaze patterns three dimensionally across such contiguous cross-sectional images. However, little has been done to visualize more complicated gaze patterns from the contiguous cross-sectional medical images. To address this problem, we present an interactive 3D gaze visualization tool, GazeVis, where InfoVis and SciVis techniques are harmonized to show the abstract gaze data along with a realistic 3D rendering of the visual stimuli (i.e., organs and lesions). We present case studies with 12 radiologists who use GazeVis to investigate gaze patterns of their colleagues with different levels of expertise, providing empirical evidences about the competence of our gaze visualization system.","article_number":"6687159","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6687159","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6687159/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6687159/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6774500,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"May 2014","start_page":"726","end_page":"739","citing_paper_count":11,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":1035,"insert_date":"20131218","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three-dimensional displays","Data visualization","Medical diagnostic imaging","Rendering (computer graphics)","Visualization","Computed tomography"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Eye tracking","gaze visualization","volume rendering","medical images","interaction technique"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Medical Imaging","Clinical Imaging","Diagnostic Imaging","Cross-sectional Images","Interactive Visualization","Contiguous Images","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Computed Tomography","Computed Tomography Scan","CT Scan","Visual Stimuli","Visual Stimulus","Single Image","Eye-tracking","Level Of Expertise","Consecutive Images","Gaze Patterns","Gaze Data","Interactive Visualization Tool","Transfer Function","Number Of Images","Series Of Images","Serial Imaging","3D Space","3-dimensional Space","Gaussian Filter","3D Visualization","Gaze Points","Abdominal Radiology","2D Views","Temporal Filtering","Axial View","Window Settings","Expert Radiologists","Volume Rendering","Volumetric Rendering","Peripheral Vision","Multiplanar Reconstruction"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.174","title":"Physics-Based Deformable Tongue Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"5","issn":"2160-9306","rank":140,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37599955300","id":37599955300,"full_name":"Yin Yang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37280352300","id":37280352300,"full_name":"Xiaohu Guo","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Psychological Sciences, Case Western Reserve University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38575775500","id":38575775500,"full_name":"Jennell Vick","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Psychological Sciences, Case Western Reserve University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38230915800","id":38230915800,"full_name":"Luis G.

The tongue is modeled with the Finite Element Method (FEM) and driven by the motion capture data gathered during speech production. Several novel deformation visualization techniques are presented for in-depth data analysis and exploration. To reveal the hidden semantic information of the tongue deformation, we present a novel physics-based volume segmentation algorithm. This is accomplished by decomposing the tongue model into segments based on its deformation pattern with the computation of deformation subspaces and fitting the target deformation locally at each segment. In addition, the strain energy is utilized to provide an intuitive low-dimensional visualization for the high-dimensional sequential motion. Energy-interpolation-based morphing is also equipped to effectively highlight the subtle differences of the 3D deformed shapes without any visual occlusion. Our experimental results and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework. The proposed methods, though originally designed for the exploration of the tongue deformation, are also valid for general deformation analysis of other shapes.","article_number":"6280549","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6280549","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6280549/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6280549/","publication_title":"IEEE

important characteristic of many real networks, which shows high concentrations of edges within special groups of vertices and low concentrations between these groups. Community related graph analysis, such as discovering relationships among communities, identifying attribute-structure relationships, and selecting a large number of vertices with desired structural features and attributes, are common tasks in knowledge discovery in such networks. The clutter and the lack of interactivity often hinder efforts to apply traditional graph visualization techniques in these tasks. In this paper, we propose PIWI, a novel graph visual analytics approach to these tasks. Instead of using Node-Link Diagrams (NLDs), PIWI provides coordinated, uncluttered visualizations, and novel interactions based on graph community structure. The novel features, applicability, and limitations of this new technique have been discussed in detail. A set of case studies and preliminary user studies have been conducted with real graphs containing thousands of vertices, which provide supportive evidence about the usefulness of PIWI in community related tasks.","article_number":"6269876","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6269876","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6269876/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6269876/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6494559,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"June 2013","start_page":"1034","end_page":"1047","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":827,"insert_date":"20120816","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Communities","Tag clouds","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Color","Measurement"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Information visualization","visual analytics","graph visualization","community structure"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Community Structure","Visual Exploration","User Study","Visual Analysis","Graphical Analysis","Graphon","Related Tasks","Visibility Graph","Knowledge Discovery","Set Of Case Studies","Semantic","Cloud Data","Word Cloud","Analysis Tasks","Visual Presentation","Visual Demonstration","Community Detection","Context-aware","Excel 2007","Multiple Communities","Interactive Exploration","News Events","Effects Of News","Types Of Graphs","Large Graphs","Vertex Labels","Graph Labels","Visual Metaphors","Visual Reasoning","Complex Graph","Neighboring Vertices","Neighborhood Of A Vertex","Neighbors Of Vertex"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2015.52","title":"Understanding Digital Note-Taking Practice for Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"4","issn":"1558-1756","rank":142,"volume":"35","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Calgary and Inria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945380800","id":37945380800,"full_name":"Wesley Willett","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary and Inria"]}},{"affiliation":"Inria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085438672","id":37085438672,"full_name":"Pascal Goffin","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Inria"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, CA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591317800","id":37591317800,"full_name":"Petra Isenberg","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, CA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Magazines","abstract":"As digital notebooks become common forms of external memory, keeping track of these volumes of content is also becoming increasingly difficult.

While techniques focusing on high-quality global illumination have been extensively studied, few works handle the interaction of light with materials in the volume. Existing techniques for light-material interaction are limited in their ability to handle high-frequency real-world material data, and the current treatment of volume data poorly supports the correct integration of surface materials. In this paper, we introduce an alternative definition for the transfer function which supports surface-like behavior at the boundaries between volume components and volume-like behavior within. We show that this definition enables multi-material rendering with high-quality, real-world material data.

The simple techniques used to display them, including juxtaposing, swapping and monolithic blending, often fail to convey the underlying phenomenon in a meaningful manner. We introduce Baia, a framework to create advanced animated transitions, called animation plans, between before-and-after images. Baia relies on a pixel-based transition model that gives authors much expressive power, while keeping animations for common types of changes easy to create thanks to predefined animation primitives. We describe our model, the associated animation editor, and report on two user studies. In the first study, advanced transitions enabled by Baia were compared to monolithic blending, and perceived as more realistic and better at focusing viewer's attention on a region of interest than the latter. The second study aimed at gathering feedback about the usability of Baia's animation editor.","article_number":"8267097","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8267097","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8267097/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8267097/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8594686,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"1 Feb. 2019","start_page":"1347","end_page":"1360","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":434,"insert_date":"20180123","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Animation","Visualization","Satellite broadcasting","Remote sensing","Focusing","Lakes","NASA"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Animation","blending","staging","remote sensing images"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Satellite Images","User Study","Image Pairs","Meaningful Manner","Effects Of Change","Pairing","ANOVA Test","Types Of Changes","Changing Nature","Image Area","Digital Elevation Model","Digital Terrain Model","Digital Surface Model","Sea Level Rise","Colorblind","Color Blindness","Colour-blind","Color Vision Deficiency","Time Stamp","Interesting Changes","Involvement Of Changes","Morphological Operations","Elements Of Interest","Rest Of The Image","Dark Pixels","Color Histogram","Colour Histogram","Audience Attention","Contour Shape","Simple Transition","Geographic Phenomena","Geographic Phenomenon","Video Editing","Image Change","Visual Comparison","Starting Values","Pixel Distance","Distance Of Each Pixel"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2719684","title":"Towards High-Quality Visualization of Superfluid Vortices","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"8","issn":"2160-9306","rank":148,"volume":"24","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086089439","id":37086089439,"full_name":"Yulong Guo","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086091876","id":37086091876,"full_name":"Xiaopei Liu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Advanced Studies, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086403580","id":37086403580,"full_name":"Chi Xiong","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Advanced Studies, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086091701","id":37086091701,"full_name":"Xuemiao Xu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37336329800","id":37336329800,"full_name":"Chi-Wing Fu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Superfluidity is a special state of matter exhibiting macroscopic quantum phenomena and acting like a fluid with zero viscosity. In such a state, superfluid vortices exist as phase singularities of the model equation with unique distributions. This paper presents novel techniques to aid the visual understanding of superfluid vortices based on the state-of-the-art non-linear Klein-Gordon equation, which evolves a complex scalar field, giving rise to special vortex lattice/ring structures with dynamic vortex formation, reconnection, and Kelvin waves, etc. By formulating a numerical model with theoretical physicists in superfluid research, we obtain high-quality superfluid flow data sets without noise-like waves, suitable for vortex visualization. By further exploring superfluid vortex properties, we develop a new vortex identification and visualization method: a novel mechanism with velocity circulation to overcome phase singularity and an orthogonal-plane strategy to avoid ambiguity. Hence, our visualizations can help reveal various superfluid vortex structures and enable domain experts for related visual analysis, such as the steady vortex lattice/ring structures, dynamic vortex string interactions with reconnections and energy radiations, where the famous Kelvin waves and decaying vortex tangle were clearly observed. These visualizations have assisted physicists to verify the superfluid model, and further explore its dynamic behavior more intuitively.","article_number":"7959130","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7959130","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7959130/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7959130/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8400450,"publication_year":2018,"publication_date":"1 Aug. 2018","start_page":"2440","end_page":"2455","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":627,"insert_date":"20170626","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Mathematical model","Data visualization","Visualization","Numerical models","Data models","Physics","Three-dimensional displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Superfluid dynamics","vortex structure","visual analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["High-quality Visualization","High Quality Visualization","Superfluid Vortices","Equation Modeling","Identification Method","Identification Methods","Visual Analysis","Visual Methods","Visual Method","Domain Experts","State Of Matter","Vortical Structures","Vortex Structures","Vortex Formation","Formation Of Vortices","Kelvin Waves","Macroscopic Phenomena","Macroscopic Phenomenon","Phase Singularities","Simulation Results","Second Derivative","Second-order Derivatives","Grid Cells","Grid Points","Parallel Lines","Plane Parallel","Local Dynamics","Group Of Scientists","Vortex Ring","Vortex Core","Vortex Lines","Vortex Tubes","3D Simulation","Bose-Einstein Condensates","Bose Einstein Condensate","2D Simulations","Grid Resolution","High-order Scheme","Higher-order Schemes","Spatial Derivatives","Radial Dimension"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2016.90","title":"Sports Tournament Predictions Using Direct Manipulation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"5","issn":"1558-1756","rank":149,"volume":"36","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Université de Lyon","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681739300","id":37681739300,"full_name":"Romain Vuillemot","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Université de Lyon"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077505300","id":37077505300,"full_name":"Charles Perin","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Magazines","abstract":"An advanced interface for sports tournament predictions uses direct manipulation to allow users to make nonlinear predictions.

Visualization of statistical results can help identify clusters and anomalies as well as analyze deviation, distribution, and correlation. Furthermore, they can provide visual abstractions and symbolism for categorized data. In this paper, we begin our study of visualization of image statistics by considering visual representations of power spectra, which are commonly used to visualize different categories of images. We show that they convey a limited amount of statistical information about image categories and their support for analytical tasks is ineffective. We then introduce several new visual representations, which convey different or more information about image statistics.

Our approach is based on two observations. The first observation is that the trajectory of some nodes can be approximated well without recording the position of the node for every state. The second observation is that there are groups of nodes whose motion from one state to the next can be approximated well with a single transformation. We present data set simplification techniques that take advantage of this node data redundancy. Our techniques are general, supporting many types of simulations, they achieve good compression factors, and they allow rigorous control of the maximum node position approximation error. We demonstrate our approach in the context of finite element analysis data, of liquid flow simulation data, and of fusion simulation data.","article_number":"6060816","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6060816","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6060816/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6060816/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6238449,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Sept. 2012","start_page":"1537","end_page":"1548","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":483,"insert_date":"20111025","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Trajectory","Data models","Data visualization","Clustering algorithms","Encoding","Approximation methods","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Simplification of node positions","trajectory simplification","trajectory clustering","rigid body decomposition","interactive visualization","simulation data compression."]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Node Positions","Location Of Nodes","Interactive Visualization","Visualization Of Datasets","Simulated Data","Finite Element","Simple Technique","Finite Element Analysis","Maximum Position","Group Of Nodes","Compression Factor","Time-varying Data","Triangular","Triangle","Decoding","Decryption","Running Time","Average Error","Rigid Body","Point Cloud","Single Cluster","Individual Trajectories","Intermediate Position","Intermediate Locations","Trajectory Clustering","Error Threshold","Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics","Rigid Body Transformation","Storage Cost","Connectivity Information","Information In Conjunction","Simple Trajectory","Single Trajectory","Simple Datasets","Simple Data Set","Euler Angles"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/MCG.2016.62","title":"WarpIV: In Situ Visualization and Analysis of Ion Accelerator Simulations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"1558-1756","rank":153,"volume":"36","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38549423900","id":38549423900,"full_name":"Oliver Rübel","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085457420","id":37085457420,"full_name":"Burlen Loring","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267917700","id":37267917700,"full_name":"Jean-Luc Vay","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37319209900","id":37319209900,"full_name":"David P.

To enable the efficient analysis of large-scale, high-fidelity particle accelerator simulations using the Warp simulation suite, the authors introduce the Warp In situ Visualization Toolkit (WarpIV). WarpIV integrates state-of-the-art in situ visualization and analysis using VisIt with Warp, supports management and control of complex in situ visualization and analysis workflows, and implements integrated analytics to facilitate query- and feature-based data analytics and efficient large-scale data analysis. WarpIV enables for the first time distributed parallel, in situ visualization of the full simulation data using high-performance compute resources as the data is being generated by Warp. The authors describe the application of WarpIV to study and compare large 2D and 3D ion accelerator simulations, demonstrating significant differences in the acceleration process in 2D and 3D simulations.

One key contribution of this paper is a parametrization technique for volumetric data sets, which takes into account material boundaries and volumetric regions. Using this technique, the resulting parametrizations of volumetric data sets enable texturing effects which create a higher degree of realism in volume rendered images.

In many disciplines, data and model scenarios are becoming multifaceted: data are often spatiotemporal and multivariate; they stem from different data sources (multimodal data), from multiple simulation runs (multirun/ensemble data), or from multiphysics simulations of interacting phenomena (multimodel data resulting from coupled simulation models). Also, data can be of different dimensionality or structured on various types of grids that need to be related or fused in the visualization. This heterogeneity of data characteristics presents new opportunities as well as technical challenges for visualization research. Visualization and interaction techniques are thus often combined with computational analysis. In this survey, we study existing methods for visualization and interactive visual analysis of multifaceted scientific data. Based on a thorough literature review, a categorization of approaches is proposed. We cover a wide range of fields and discuss to which degree the different challenges are matched with existing solutions for visualization and visual analysis.

Their advantage is a highly space-efficient graphical representation that does not require explicit drawing of edges. In this paper, we survey the design space for this class of visualization techniques. We establish the design space along the four axes of dimensionality, edge representation, node representation, and layout by examining existing implicit hierarchy visualization techniques. The survey is completed by casting some light into regions of the design space that have not yet been explored. Our design space is not a mere theoretical construct, but a practically usable tool for rapid visualization development. To that end, we discuss a software implementation of the introduced design space.","article_number":"5473227","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5473227","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5473227/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5473227/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5714210,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"April 2011","start_page":"393","end_page":"411","citing_paper_count":107,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":3081,"insert_date":"20100527","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Tree graphs","Prototypes","Solids","Layout","Casting","Space exploration","Software prototyping","Encoding","Computer graphics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Information visualization","hierarchy visualization","Treemaps","visualization design space","rapid visualization prototyping."]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Design Space","Regions Of Space","Visualization Techniques","Treemap","Functional Tree","Performance Of Trees","Node Representations","Aspect Ratio","Stock Market","Design Choices","Levels Of Hierarchy","Third Dimension","Design Decisions","Design Properties","Design Attributes","Design Dimensions","Common Principles","Common Rationale","3D Techniques","Node Attributes","Nodal Properties","Software Quality","Code Quality","Visual Design","3D Graph","3D Computer Graphics","2D Representation","Perception Of Structure","2D Visualization","Inner Nodes","Interior Nodes","Original 2D","Categorical Attributes","Classification Properties","Attribute Classification","Geometric Primitives","Graphical Primitives","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Subtree","Hierarchical Structure","Hierarchical Organization","Spatial Relationship","Bird’s Eye"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.65","title":"Splatterplots: Overcoming Overdraw in Scatter Plots","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"9","issn":"2160-9306","rank":161,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37071401300","id":37071401300,"full_name":"Adrian Mayorga","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282585700","id":37282585700,"full_name":"Michael Gleicher","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We introduce Splatterplots, a novel presentation of scattered data that enables visualizations that scale beyond standard scatter plots. Traditional scatter plots suffer from overdraw (overlapping glyphs) as the number of points per unit area increases. Overdraw obscures outliers, hides data distributions, and makes the relationship among subgroups of the data difficult to discern. To address these issues, Splatterplots abstract away information such that the density of data shown in any unit of screen space is bounded, while allowing continuous zoom to reveal abstracted details. Abstraction automatically groups dense data points into contours and samples remaining points. We combine techniques for abstraction with perceptually based color blending to reveal the relationship between data subgroups. The resulting visualizations represent the dense regions of each subgroup of the data set as smooth closed shapes and show representative outliers explicitly. We present techniques that leverage the GPU for Splatterplot computation and rendering, enabling interaction with massive data sets. We show how Splatterplots can be an effective alternative to traditional methods of displaying scatter data communicating data trends, outliers, and data set relationships much like traditional scatter plots, but scaling to data sets of higher density and up to millions of points on the screen.","article_number":"6484064","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6484064","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6484064/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6484064/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6558748,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Sept. 2013","start_page":"1526","end_page":"1538","citing_paper_count":104,"citing_patent_count":2,"download_count":3282,"insert_date":"20130321","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Image color analysis","Data visualization","Encoding","Shape","Clutter"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Scalability issues","visual design","perception theory","statistical graphics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Scatter Plot","Dense Regions","Density Data","Storage Density","Trends Data","Massive Datasets","Screen Space","Isothermal","Contour Plots","Amount Of Information","Density Estimation","Vector Field","Color Space","Color Components","Data Space","Points In Region","Standard Datasets","Number Of Scales","Distance Map","Distance Transform","Distance Field","Density Field","Visual Complexity","Close Points","Zariski Closure","Sparse Regions","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","CIE Lab","Amount Of Smoothing","Cottonwood","Smooth Contour","Hydrological","Cover Types","Regeneration Buffer","Framebuffer","Display Memory","Smooth Shape"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.76","title":"KelpFusion: A Hybrid Set Visualization Technique","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"11","issn":"2160-9306","rank":162,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Technische Universitat Eindhoven, Eindhoven, Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073861100","id":37073861100,"full_name":"Wouter Meulemans","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technische Universitat Eindhoven, Eindhoven, Netherlands"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590950700","id":37590950700,"full_name":"Nathalie Henry Riche","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Technische Universitat Eindhoven, Eindhoven, Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591266000","id":37591266000,"full_name":"Bettina Speckmann","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technische Universitat Eindhoven, Eindhoven, Netherlands"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38030020400","id":38030020400,"full_name":"Basak Alper","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University, Caulfield East, VIC, Australia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37326161000","id":37326161000,"full_name":"Tim Dwyer","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University, Caulfield East, VIC, Australia"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present KelpFusion: a method for depicting set membership of items on a map or other visualization using continuous boundaries.

Visualization of the global and local patterns within this data stream is a complex and challenging problem. Recurrence plots are an information visualization technique that can reveal trends and features in complex time series data. The recurrence plot technique works by measuring the similarity of points in a time series to all other points in the same time series and plotting the results in two dimensions. Previous studies have applied recurrence plotting techniques to textual data; however, these approaches plot recurrence using term-based similarity rather than conceptual similarity of the text. We introduce conceptual recurrence plots, which use a model of language to measure similarity between pairs of text utterances, and the similarity of all utterances is measured and displayed. In this paper, we explore how the descriptive power of the recurrence plotting technique can be used to discover patterns of interaction across a series of conversation transcripts. The results suggest that the conceptual recurrence plotting technique is a useful tool for exploring the structure of human discourse.","article_number":"5887327","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5887327","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5887327/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5887327/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6180049,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"June 2012","start_page":"988","end_page":"997","citing_paper_count":66,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1770,"insert_date":"20110616","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Semantics","Humans","Image color analysis","Pain","Surgery","Time series analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Concept map","recurrence","concept","plotting","conversation analysis","text analysis."]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Recurrence Plot","Interaction Patterns","Text Data","Text Corpus","Similar Concepts","Visualization Techniques","Conceptual Information","Diagonal","Solid Line","Horizontal Line","Basis Functions","Horizontal Plane","Horizontal Direction","Horizontal Distance","Visual System","Vertical Line","Key Concepts","Personal Life","Similarity Matrix","Similarity Matrices","Semantic Similarity","Semantic Relatedness","Concept Of System","Audience Members","List Of Terms","Recurrent Patterns","Semantic Model","White Space","Single Utterance","Complex Dynamic Systems","Color Gradient","Set Of Concepts","Term Co-occurrence","Entire Transcript","Pairwise Similarity","Number Of Utterances","Number Of Vocalizations"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.82","title":"Forecasting Hotspots—A Predictive Analytics Approach","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"4","issn":"2160-9306","rank":164,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396008400","id":37396008400,"full_name":"Ross Maciejewski","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38512951900","id":38512951900,"full_name":"Ryan Hafen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396006000","id":37396006000,"full_name":"Stephen Rudolph","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396005900","id":37396005900,"full_name":"Stephen G.

Linked views and interactive displays provide insight into correlations among people, events, and places in space and time. Analysts search for events of interest through statistical tools linked to visual displays, drill down into the data, and form hypotheses based upon the available information. However, current systems stop short of predicting events. In spatiotemporal data, analysts are searching for regions of space and time with unusually high incidences of events (hotspots). In the cases where hotspots are found, analysts would like to predict how these regions may grow in order to plan resource allocation and preventative measures. Furthermore, analysts would also like to predict where future hotspots may occur. To facilitate such forecasting, we have created a predictive visual analytics toolkit that provides analysts with linked spatiotemporal and statistical analytic views. Our system models spatiotemporal events through the combination of kernel density estimation for event distribution and seasonal trend decomposition by loess smoothing for temporal predictions. We provide analysts with estimates of error in our modeling, along with spatial and temporal alerts to indicate the occurrence of statistically significant hotspots. Spatial data are distributed based on a modeling of previous event locations, thereby maintaining a temporal coherence with past events. Such tools allow analysts to perform real-time hypothesis testing, plan intervention strategies, and allocate resources to correspond to perceived threats.","article_number":"5473230","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5473230","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5473230/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5473230/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5714210,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"April 2011","start_page":"440","end_page":"453","citing_paper_count":63,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":2968,"insert_date":"20100527","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Spatiotemporal phenomena","Resource management","Data analysis","Visual analytics","Predictive models","Kernel","Smoothing methods","Coherence","Performance analysis","Performance evaluation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Predictive analytics","visual analytics","syndromic surveillance."]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Prediction Analysis","Predictive Analytics Approaches","Analysis System","Time And Space","Spacetime","Hypothesis Testing","Visual System","Density Estimation","Visual Analysis","Past Events","Spatiotemporal Data","Temporal Prediction","Temporal Anticipation","Spatiotemporal Effects","Spatiotemporal Events","Seasonal Decomposition","Number Of Patients","Time Series","Magnitude Of Change","Exploratory Data","Spatial Model","Event Detection","Map Of Area","Time Series Prediction","Time-series Forecasting","Spatial Scan Statistic","Public Health Surveillance","Syndromic Surveillance","Clinical Surveillance","Prediction Of Events","Predictable Consequences","Current Events","Montgomery County","Seasonal Component","Events In Areas","Time Series Models","Time-series Regression","Color Map"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.89","title":"The Five Ws for Information Visualization with Application to Healthcare Informatics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"11","issn":"2160-9306","rank":165,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Visual Analytics and Imaging Laboratory at the Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38025124400","id":38025124400,"full_name":"Zhiyuan Zhang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Analytics and Imaging Laboratory at the Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Visual Analytics and Imaging Laboratory at the Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073902300","id":37073902300,"full_name":"Bing Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Analytics and Imaging Laboratory at the Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Applied Logic Laboratory at the Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073918600","id":37073918600,"full_name":"Faisal Ahmed","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Applied Logic Laboratory at the Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Applied Logic Laboratory at the Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284911300","id":37284911300,"full_name":"I.V.

Then standard clustering methods applied to the point sets in IRn yield a segmentation of the original vector field. Our approach provides a global analysis of 3D vector fields which incorporates the topological segmentation but yields additional information. In addition to a pure segmentation, the established map provides a natural \"parametrization” visualized by the manifolds. We test our approach on a number of synthetic and real-world data sets.","article_number":"5753894","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5753894","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5753894/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5753894/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6129449,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"March 2012","start_page":"407","end_page":"420","citing_paper_count":50,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1083,"insert_date":"20110421","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Manifolds","Three dimensional displays","Silicon","Streaming media","Measurement","Topology","Visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Vector fields","streamline embedding","clustering."]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Vector Field","3D Vector Field","Manifold","Real-world Datasets","Geometry And Topology","Critical Point","Distancing Measures","Dimensional Space","Multidimensional Space","Eigenvectors","Distance Matrix","Distance Matrices","Diagonal Matrix","Diagonal Matrices","Alternative Measures","Surrogate Measure","Diffusion Tensor Imaging","Diffusion-weighted Imaging","Diffusion Tensor","Dimensional Data","Symmetric Matrix","Symmetric Matrices","Surface Reconstruction","Spectral Clustering","Hausdorff Distance","Objective Dimensions","Number Of Streamlines","Multidimensional Scaling Method","Least-squares Sense","Magnitude Of Eigenvalues","Dimensional Manifold","Similarity Matrix","Similarity Matrices","Minimum Distance","Regular Grid","Cartesian Grid","Grid Structure","Rectangular Grid","Separate Curves","Multiscale Method"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.133","title":"A Survey of Visualization Pipelines","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"2160-9306","rank":167,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284250900","id":37284250900,"full_name":"Kenneth Moreland","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The most common abstraction used by visualization libraries and applications today is what is known as the visualization pipeline.

The benefits for the analysis session go well beyond the pure selection of appropriate data sets and range from providing orientation or even guidance along a preferred analysis path to a potential overall speedup, allowing data to be fetched ahead of time. We illustrate the design process for a biomedical use case that aims at determining a treatment plan for cancer patients from the visual analysis of a large, heterogeneous clinical data pool.

This is not so foreign to us since we, when traveling, also experience the world in a serial fashion. But we typically have access to a map to help with positioning, orientation, navigation, and trip planning. Here, we propose a multivariate data exploration tool that compares high-dimensional space navigation with a sightseeing trip. It decomposes this activity into five major tasks: 1) Identify the sights: use a map to identify the sights of interest and their location; 2) Plan the trip: connect the sights of interest along a specifyable path; 3) Go on the trip: travel along the route; 4) Hop off the bus: experience the location, look around, zoom into detail; and 5) Orient and localize: regain bearings in the map. We describe intuitive and interactive tools for all of these tasks, both global navigation within the map and local exploration of the data distributions. For the latter, we describe a polygonal touchpad interface which enables users to smoothly tilt the projection plane in high-dimensional space to produce multivariate scatterplots that best convey the data relationships under investigation. Motion parallax and illustrative motion trails aid in the perception of these transient patterns. We describe the use of our system within two applications: 1) the exploratory discovery of data configurations that best fit a personal preference in the presence of tradeoffs and 2) interactive cluster analysis via cluster sculpting in N-D.","article_number":"6155716","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6155716","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6155716/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6155716/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6376574,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Feb. 2013","start_page":"291","end_page":"305","citing_paper_count":37,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1665,"insert_date":"20120221","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Vectors","Principal component analysis","Navigation","Three dimensional displays","Data visualization","Space exploration","Measurement"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["High-dimensional data","coordinated and multiple views","zooming and navigation techniques","data transformation and representation","data clustering","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Space Exploration","Space Missions","Exploratory Data","Serialized","Subclusters","Bar Charts","Data Space","Negative Direction","Single Vector","Selection Task","Major Vector","Control Panel","Hypersphere","Unit Hypersphere","Usage Scenarios","Multivariate Relationships","US News","Projection Views","Preferred Configuration","Orientation Configuration","Color Labels","Ordering Of The Vertices","Vertex Order","Subspace Clustering","Grand Tour","Content-based Image Retrieval","Parallel Coordinates","Scatterplot Matrix","Scatterplot Matrices","Dot Product","Dimensional Data","Depth Perception","Depth Cues","Means Algorithm","Interfacial Interaction"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.101","title":"A Structure-Based Distance Metric for High-Dimensional Space Exploration with Multidimensional Scaling","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"2160-9306","rank":172,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Center for Visual Computing, Stony Brook, NY","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086630009","id":37086630009,"full_name":"Jenny Hyunjung Lee","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Center for Visual Computing, Stony Brook, NY"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Dowling College, Oakdale, NY","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37882660300","id":37882660300,"full_name":"Kevin T.

We were inspired by the perceptual processes evoked in the method of parallel coordinates which enables users to visually aggregate the data by the patterns the polylines exhibit across the dimension axes. We call the path of such a polyline its structure and suggest a metric that captures this structure directly in high-dimensional space. This allows us to better gauge the distances of spatially distant data constellations and so achieve data aggregations in MDS plots that are more cognizant of existing high-dimensional structure similarities.

The algorithm proceeds by dividing the input into a set of subvolumes that have loop-free Reeb graphs using the join tree of the scalar function and computes the Reeb graph by combining the contour trees of all the subvolumes. Since the key ingredient of this method is a series of union-find operations, the algorithm is fast in practice.

The present paper extends this concept to 3D vector fields. In traditional 3D vector field topology separatrices can be obtained by integrating stream lines from 0D seeds corresponding to critical points. We show that in our new concept, in contrast, 1D seeding constructs are required for computing streak-based separatrices. In analogy to the 2D generalization we show that invariant manifolds can be obtained by seeding streak surfaces along distinguished path surfaces emanating from intersection curves between codimension-1 ridges in the forward and reverse finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) fields. These path surfaces represent a time-dependent generalization of critical points and convey further structure in time-dependent topology of vector fields. Compared to the traditional approach based on FTLE ridges, the resulting streak manifolds ease the analysis of Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) with respect to visual quality and computational cost, especially when time series of LCS are computed. We exemplify validity and utility of the new approach using both synthetic examples and computational fluid dynamics results.","article_number":"6203503","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6203503","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6203503/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6203503/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6407462,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"March 2013","start_page":"379","end_page":"392","citing_paper_count":31,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":514,"insert_date":"20120522","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Vectors","Manifolds","Topology","Three dimensional displays","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Trajectory","Surface reconstruction"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Vector field topology","Lagrangian coherent structures","streak lines","time-dependent vector fields"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Vector Field","Time-dependent Field","Time-dependent Vector","Time-dependent Vector Field","Time Series","Streamline","Critical Point","Static Field","Lyapunov Exponent","Traditional Field","Intersection Of Curves","Traditional Vector","Invariant Manifold","Time Interval","Graphics Processing Unit","GPUs","Flow Field","Advection","Adaptive Technique","Periodic Orbits","Points In Period","Periodic Points","Uniform Grid","Pathlines","Sparse Grid","Refinement Level","Sharp Ridge","Hyperbolic Geometry","Hyperbolic Plane","Hyperbolic Surface","Time-dependent Flow","Flow Map","Anisotropic Case","Isotropic Case","Opposite Field","Field Reversal"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.93","title":"Using Patterns to Encode Color Information for Dichromats","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":175,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of California Berkeley, Irvine, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38523589500","id":38523589500,"full_name":"Behzad Sajadi","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California Berkeley, Irvine, CA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of California Berkeley, Irvine, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37408075400","id":37408075400,"full_name":"Aditi Majumder","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California Berkeley, Irvine, CA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Instituto de Informática, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37554064200","id":37554064200,"full_name":"Manuel M.

Color vision deficiency (CVD) affects approximately 200 million individuals worldwide and considerably degrades their performance in understanding such contents by creating red-green or blue-yellow ambiguities. While several content-specific methods have been proposed to resolve these ambiguities, they cannot achieve this effectively in many situations for contents with a large variety of colors. More importantly, they cannot facilitate color identification. We propose a technique for using patterns to encode color information for individuals with CVD, in particular for dichromats. We present the first content-independent method to overlay patterns on colored visualization contents that not only minimizes ambiguities but also allows color identification. Further, since overlaying patterns does not compromise the underlying original colors, it does not hamper the perception of normal trichromats. We validated our method with two user studies: one including 11 subjects with CVD and 19 normal trichromats, and focused on images that use colors to represent multiple categories; and another one including 16 subjects with CVD and 22 normal trichromats, which considered a broader set of images. Our results show that overlaying patterns significantly improves the performance of dichromats in several color-based visualization tasks, making their performance almost similar to normal trichromats'. More interestingly, the patterns augment color information in a positive manner, allowing normal trichromats to perform with greater accuracy.","article_number":"6175893","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6175893","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6175893/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6175893/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6363448,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Jan. 2013","start_page":"118","end_page":"129","citing_paper_count":30,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1414,"insert_date":"20120403","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image color analysis","Visualization","Three dimensional displays","Color","Computed tomography","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["image colour analysis","colour vision","data visualisation","image coding","color-based visualization tasks","color information encoding","dichromats","visualization applications","color vision deficiency","CVD","red-green ambiguity","blue-yellow ambiguity","content-specific methods","color identification","content-independent method","colored visualization contents","normal trichromats","Image color analysis","Visualization","Three dimensional displays","Color","Computed tomography","Data visualization","color visualization","Color vision deficiency","visual aids","patterns in visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Color Information","Dichromatism","User Study","Visual Task","Color Vision","Color Perception","Colorblind","Color Vision Deficiency","Original Color","Trichromatic","Subjects In Group","Classification Task","Categorization Task","Vertical Line","Slope Of Line","Patterns Of Use","Color Images","3D Space","3-dimensional Space","Color Space","Color Components","Line Segment","Local Image","Color Map","Preference Patterns","Orientation Patterns","Contrasting Patterns","Yellow Shading","Photopigment","Color Gamut","Simple Metrics","Uniform Color","Interpretation Of Patterns","RGB Space","Consistent Answers","Scale Dependence"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.109","title":"A Modular Degree-of-Interest Specification for the Visual Analysis of Large Dynamic Networks","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"2160-9306","rank":176,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37662339600","id":37662339600,"full_name":"James Abello","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Rostock, Rostock, Mecklenburg Vorpommern, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396082800","id":37396082800,"full_name":"Steffen Hadlak","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Rostock, Rostock, Mecklenburg Vorpommern, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Rostock, Rostock, Mecklenburg Vorpommern, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283240400","id":37283240400,"full_name":"Heidrun Schumann","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Rostock, Rostock, Mecklenburg Vorpommern, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Rostock, Rostock, Mecklenburg Vorpommern, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37408482600","id":37408482600,"full_name":"Hans-Jörg Schulz","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Rostock, Rostock, Mecklenburg Vorpommern, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Large dynamic networks are targets of analysis in many fields. Tracking temporal changes at scale in these networks is challenging due in part to the fact that small changes can be missed or drowned-out by the rest of the network. For static networks, current approaches allow the identification of specific network elements within their context. However, in the case of dynamic networks, the user is left alone with finding salient local network elements and tracking them over time. In this work, we introduce a modular DoI specification to flexibly define what salient changes are and to assign them a measure of their importance in a time-varying setting. The specification takes into account neighborhood structure information, numerical attributes of nodes/edges, and their temporal evolution. A tailored visualization of the DoI specification complements our approach. Alongside a traditional node-link view of the dynamic network, it serves as an interface for the interactive definition of a DoI function. By using it to successively refine and investigate the captured details, it supports the analysis of dynamic networks from an initial view until pinpointing a user's analysis goal. We report on applying our approach to scientific coauthorship networks and give concrete results for the DBLP data set.","article_number":"6574858","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6574858","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6574858/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6574858/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6777146,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"March 2014","start_page":"337","end_page":"350","citing_paper_count":29,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1695,"insert_date":"20130805","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Context","Data visualization","Radiation detectors","Educational institutions","Electronic mail","Navigation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Time-varying graphs","dynamic graph visualization","degree-of-interest"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Dynamic Network","Visual Analysis","Dynamic Network Analysis","Analysis Of Large Networks","Interactive","Numerous Properties","Numerous Attributes","Numerous Dimensions","Network View","Co-authorship Network","High Values","Global Level","Local Changes","Specific Components","Root Node","Parent Node","Color Map","Sum Of Weights","Visibility Graph","Number Of Time Points","Individual Terms","Functional Blocks","Elements Of Interest","Edge Attributes","Edge Properties","Dynamic Graph","Multiple Foci","Multiple Focus","Lower Clustering Coefficient","User Interest","Geodesic Distance","Consecutive Time Points","Decay Factor","Clustering Coefficient","Functional Components"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.35","title":"Efficient Visibility Encoding for Dynamic Illumination in Direct Volume Rendering","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"2160-9306","rank":177,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Science and Technology (ITN), C-Research, Media and Information Technology (MIT), Linköping University, Norrkoping, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38230927900","id":38230927900,"full_name":"Joel Kronander","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Science and Technology (ITN), C-Research, Media and Information Technology (MIT), Linköping University, Norrkoping, Sweden"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Science and Technology (ITN), C-Research, Media and Information Technology (MIT), Linköping University, Norrkoping, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38228659100","id":38228659100,"full_name":"Daniel Jonsson","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Science and Technology (ITN), C-Research, Media and Information Technology (MIT), Linköping University, Norrkoping, Sweden"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Science and Technology (ITN), C-Research, Media and Information Technology (MIT), Linköping University, Norrkoping, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38241309500","id":38241309500,"full_name":"Joakim Low","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Science and Technology (ITN), C-Research, Media and Information Technology (MIT), Linköping University, Norrkoping, Sweden"]}},{"affiliation":"Siemens AG Corporate Research and Development, Princeton, NJ, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284208400","id":37284208400,"full_name":"Patric Ljung","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Siemens AG Corporate Research and Development, Princeton, NJ, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Science and Technology (ITN), C-Research, Media and Information Technology (MIT), Linköping University, Norrkoping, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284192000","id":37284192000,"full_name":"Anders Ynnerman","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Science and Technology (ITN), C-Research, Media and Information Technology (MIT), Linköping University, Norrkoping, Sweden"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Science and Technology (ITN), C-Research, Media and Information Technology (MIT), Linköping University, Norrkoping, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38229574900","id":38229574900,"full_name":"Jonas Unger","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Science and Technology (ITN), C-Research, Media and Information Technology (MIT), Linköping University, Norrkoping, Sweden"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present an algorithm that enables real-time dynamic shading in direct volume rendering using general lighting, including directional lights, point lights, and environment maps. Real-time performance is achieved by encoding local and global volumetric visibility using spherical harmonic (SH) basis functions stored in an efficient multiresolution grid over the extent of the volume. Our method enables high-frequency shadows in the spatial domain, but is limited to a low-frequency approximation of visibility and illumination in the angular domain. In a first pass, level of detail (LOD) selection in the grid is based on the current transfer function setting. This enables rapid online computation and SH projection of the local spherical distribution of visibility information. Using a piecewise integration of the SH coefficients over the local regions, the global visibility within the volume is then computed. By representing the light sources using their SH projections, the integral over lighting, visibility, and isotropic phase functions can be efficiently computed during rendering. The utility of our method is demonstrated in several examples showing the generality and interactive performance of the approach.","article_number":"5710905","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5710905","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5710905/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5710905/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6129449,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"March 2012","start_page":"447","end_page":"462","citing_paper_count":29,"citing_patent_count":2,"download_count":1069,"insert_date":"20110210","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Lighting","Rendering (computer graphics)","Light sources","Harmonic analysis","Scattering","Real time systems","Approximation methods"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Volumetric illumination","precomputed radiance transfer","volume rendering."]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Volume Rendering","Volumetric Rendering","Efficient Encoding","Dynamic Illumination","Interactive","Light Source","Visual Information","Transfer Function","Direct Light","Phase Function","Spherical Harmonics","Environment Map","Global Vision","Fringe Visibility","Interference Visibility","Visibility Function","Angular Domain","Spherical Harmonic Coefficients","Local Effects","Local Events","Local Data","Grid Points","Rate Efficiency","Evaluation Of Efficiency","Radial Basis Function","Number Of Rays","Spherical Harmonic Expansion","Global Resolution","Light Environment","Point Light Source","Local Radius","Localization Radii","Global Grid","Ray Casting","Ray Shooting","Ring Artifact","Update Time"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.108","title":"Enhanced Spatial Stability with Hilbert and Moore Treemaps","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":178,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38519705000","id":38519705000,"full_name":"Susanne Tak","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37330497800","id":37330497800,"full_name":"Andy Cockburn","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Treemaps are a well known and powerful space-filling visualisation method for displaying hierarchical data.

In this paper, we demonstrate that spatial stability is not fully captured by the commonly used \"distance change” (DC) metric, and we introduce a new \"location drift” (LD) metric to more fully capture spatial stability. An empirical study examines the validity and usefulness of the location drift metric, showing that it explains some effects on user performance that distance change does not. Next, we introduce \"Hilbert” and \"Moore” treemap algorithms, which are designed to achieve high spatial stability. We assess their performance in comparison to other treemaps, showing that Hilbert and Moore treemaps perform well across all stability metrics.","article_number":"6185545","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6185545","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6185545/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6185545/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6363448,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Jan. 2013","start_page":"141","end_page":"148","citing_paper_count":28,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":881,"insert_date":"20120417","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Layout","Measurement","Stability criteria","Algorithm design and analysis","Gravity","Monitoring"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["trees (mathematics)","data visualisation","LD","enhanced spatial stability","Hilbert treemaps","Moore treemaps","space-filling visualisation method","hierarchical data","distance change metric","DC","location drift metric","Layout","Measurement","Stability criteria","Algorithm design and analysis","Gravity","Monitoring","spatial stability","Treemap","space-filling curve"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Spatial Stability","Change In Distance","User Performance","Hierarchical Data","Stability Metrics","Cardinality","Set Size","Center Of Mass","Center Of Gravity","Internal Validity","Aspect Ratio","Random Order","Measure Of Stability","Items In Order","Crumpled","Stability Score","Fewer Items","Retrieval Performance","Item Locations","Item Position","Low Aspect Ratio","Screening In Areas","Low Drift","Dynamic Update","Zipf Distribution","Retrieval Of Items","High Drift","Impact Of Drift"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.111","title":"Interactive Visual Analysis of Heterogeneous Scientific Data across an Interface","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"7","issn":"2160-9306","rank":179,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546620000","id":37546620000,"full_name":"Johannes Kehrer","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546620600","id":37546620600,"full_name":"Philipp Muigg","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"SimVis GmbH, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546620400","id":37546620400,"full_name":"Helmut Doleisch","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SimVis GmbH, Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274158800","id":37274158800,"full_name":"Helwig Hauser","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present a systematic approach to the interactive visual analysis of heterogeneous scientific data.

This visualization technique supports the display of multidimensional data by providing users with a multiparameter encoding scheme within a single visual encoding paradigm. Given a set of geographically located spatiotemporal events, we approximate the data as a continuous function using kernel density estimation. The density estimation encodes the probability that an event will occur within the space over a given temporal aggregation. These probability values, for one or more set of events, are then encoded into a bristle map. A bristle map consists of a series of straight lines that extend from, and are connected to, linear map elements such as roads, train, subway lines, and so on. These lines vary in length, density, color, orientation, and transparencyâcreating the multivariate attribute encoding scheme where event magnitude, change, and uncertainty can be mapped as various bristle parameters. This approach increases the amount of information displayed in a single plot and allows for unique designs for various information schemes. We show the application of our bristle map encoding scheme using categorical spatiotemporal police reports. Our examples demonstrate the use of our technique for visualizing data magnitude, variable comparisons, and a variety of multivariate attribute combinations. To evaluate the effectiveness of our bristle map, we have conducted quantitative and qualitative evaluations in which we compare our bristle map to conventional geovisualization techniques.

The basic idea is to convert the input vector field to a piecewise constant (PC) vector field, whose trajectories can be computed using simple geometric rules. To overcome the intrinsic difficulty in PC vector fields (in particular, discontinuity along mesh edges), we borrow results from the theory of differential inclusions. The input vector field and its PC variant have similar Morse decompositions. We introduce a robust and efficient algorithm to compute Morse decompositions of a PC vector field. Our approach provides subtriangle precision for Morse sets. In addition, we describe a Morse set classification framework which we use to color code the Morse sets in order to enhance the visualization. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach with three well-known simulation data sets, for which our method has produced Morse decompositions that are similar to or finer than those obtained using existing techniques, and is over an order of magnitude faster.","article_number":"6143903","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6143903","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6143903/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6143903/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6180049,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"June 2012","start_page":"938","end_page":"951","citing_paper_count":26,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":450,"insert_date":"20120131","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Vectors","Trajectory","Orbits","Support vector machine classification","Topology","Spirals","Indexes"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Morse decomposition","vector field topology."]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Vector Field","Piecewise Constant Vector","Morse Decomposition","Simulated Datasets","Differential Inclusion","Maximum And Minimum","Stationary Point","Extreme Values","Extremal","Running Time","Flow Direction","Precise Results","Precision Of Results","Directed Graph","Directed Edge","Linear Time","Iterative Refinement","Periodic Orbits","Points In Period","Periodic Points","Zero Vector","Null Vector","Nonzero Vector","Triangular Mesh","Triangle Mesh","Goal Of This Section","Graph Size","Chaotic Attractor","Strange Attractor","Mesh Vertices","Mesh Vertex","Trajectory Segments","Components Of The Graph","Incident Edges","Adaptive Refinement"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.20","title":"The Generalized Sensitivity Scatterplot","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"10","issn":"2160-9306","rank":182,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593323300","id":37593323300,"full_name":"Yu-Hsuan Chan","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282925900","id":37282925900,"full_name":"Carlos D.

However, accurately understanding the shape of multidimensional points from 2D projections remains challenging due to overlap. Consequently, there are a lot of variations on the scatterplot as a visual metaphor for this limitation. An important aspect often overlooked in scatterplots is the issue of sensitivity or local trend, which may help in identifying the type of relationship between two variables. However, it is not well known how or what factors influence the perception of trends from 2D scatterplots. To shed light on this aspect, we conducted an experiment where we asked people to directly draw the perceived trends on a 2D scatterplot. We found that augmenting scatterplots with local sensitivity helps to fill the gaps in visual perception while retaining the simplicity and readability of a 2D scatterplot. We call this augmentation the generalized sensitivity scatterplot (GSS). In a GSS, sensitivity coefficients are visually depicted as flow lines, which give a sense of continuity and orientation of the data that provide cues about the way data points are scattered in a higher dimensional space. We introduce a series of glyphs and operations that facilitate the analysis of multidimensional data sets using GSS, and validate with a number of well-known data sets for both regression and classification tasks.","article_number":"6464263","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6464263","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6464263/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6464263/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6579618,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Oct. 2013","start_page":"1768","end_page":"1781","citing_paper_count":26,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1018,"insert_date":"20130218","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Market research","Data visualization","Sensitivity analysis","Noise","Image color analysis","Interpolation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Sensitivity analysis","data transformations","model fitting","multidimensional data visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["High-dimensional","High-dimensional Space","Dimensional Space","Multidimensional Space","Multidimensional Data","Multidimensional Analysis","Line Balancing","Flow Lines","2D Projection","Sensitivity Coefficient","Local Trends","Local Sensitivity","Interactive","Streamline","Partial Differential","Partial Derivatives","Visualization Tool","Uncertainty Analysis","Third Dimension","Points In Region","Sensitive Lines","Extra Dimension","Extra-dimensional","Interpolation Function","Local Fitting","Projective Transformation","Magnitude Of Sensitivity","Multiple Sensitivity","Hidden Dimension","Orthogonal Regression","Visual Analytics Tool","Vector Lines","Identity Transformation","Parallel Coordinates","Automatic Clustering","Line Segment"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.144","title":"Perceptually-Based Depth-Ordering Enhancement for Direct Volume Rendering","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"2160-9306","rank":183,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, CA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085525962","id":37085525962,"full_name":"Lin Zheng","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, CA"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, P.R.

This paper presents a new approach to enhancing depth-ordering perception of volume rendered images without using additional visual cues. We set up an energy function based on quantitative perception models to measure the quality of the images in terms of the effectiveness of depth-ordering and transparency perception as well as the faithfulness of the information revealed. Guided by the function, we use a conjugate gradient method to iteratively and judiciously enhance the results. Our method can complement existing systems for enhancing volume rendering results.

However, Morse decomposition is not unique, and its granularity directly impacts its computational cost. In this paper, we propose an automatic refinement scheme to construct the Morse Connection Graph (MCG) of a given vector field in a hierarchical fashion. Our framework allows a Morse set to be refined through a local update of the flow combinatorialization graph, as well as the connection regions between Morse sets. The computation is fast because the most expensive computation is concentrated on a small portion of the domain. Furthermore, the present work allows the generation of a topologically consistent hierarchy of MCGs, which cannot be obtained using a global method. The classification of the extracted Morse sets is a crucial step for the construction of the MCG, for which the Poincaré index is inadequate. We make use of an upper bound for the Conley index, provided by the Betti numbers of an index pair for a translation along the flow, to classify the Morse sets. This upper bound is sufficiently accurate for Morse set classification and provides supportive information for the automatic refinement process. An improved visualization technique for MCG is developed to incorporate the Conley indices. Finally, we apply the proposed techniques to a number of synthetic and real-world simulation data to demonstrate their utility.","article_number":"5928334","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928334","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5928334/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5928334/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6168453,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"May 2012","start_page":"767","end_page":"782","citing_paper_count":22,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":438,"insert_date":"20110623","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Indexes","Topology","Orbits","Approximation methods","Upper bound","Trajectory","Electrocardiography"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Morse decomposition","vector field topology","upper bound of Conley index","topology refinement","hierarchical refinement."]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Hierarchical Refinement","Conley Index","Conley Indices","Upper Bound","Simulated Data","Vector Field","Refinement Process","Local Updates","Hierarchical Fashion","Refinement Strategy","Refinement Scheme","Betti Numbers","Triangular","Triangle","Large Values","Dynamical","Fixed Point","Mapping Approach","Functional Approach","Directed Graph","Directed Edge","Flow Dynamics","Periodic Orbits","Points In Period","Periodic Points","Hierarchical Framework","Diesel Engine","Topological Metrics","Time-dependent Flow","Simulation Engine","Priority Queue","2D Flow","Simple Topology","Flow Map","Outer Approximation","Regular Flow","Topological Indices","Topological Index","Topological Descriptors"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.105","title":"Abstracting Attribute Space for Transfer Function Exploration and Design","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":186,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396008400","id":37396008400,"full_name":"Ross Maciejewski","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37557344300","id":37557344300,"full_name":"Yun Jang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38517641200","id":38517641200,"full_name":"Insoo Woo","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Heidelberg University, Heidelberg","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37393638200","id":37393638200,"full_name":"Heike Jänicke","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Heidelberg University, Heidelberg"]}},{"affiliation":"Texas Advanced Computing Center, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282571800","id":37282571800,"full_name":"Kelly P.

The attribute space is visualized as a function of the number of voxels, allowing the user to explore the data in terms of the attribute size/magnitude. However, such visualizations provide the user with no information on the relationship between various attribute spaces (e.g., density, temperature, pressure, x, y, z) within the multivariate data. In this work, we propose a modification to the attribute space visualization in which the user is no longer presented with the magnitude of the attribute; instead, the user is presented with an information metric detailing the relationship between attributes of the multivariate volumetric data. In this way, the user can guide their exploration based on the relationship between the attribute magnitude and user selected attribute information as opposed to being constrained by only visualizing the magnitude of the attribute. We refer to this modification to the traditional histogram widget as an abstract attribute space representation. Our system utilizes common one and two-dimensional histogram widgets where the bins of the abstract attribute space now correspond to an attribute relationship in terms of the mean, standard deviation, entropy, or skewness. In this manner, we exploit the relationships and correlations present in the underlying data with respect to the dimension(s) under examination. These relationships are often times key to insight and allow us to guide attribute discovery as opposed to automatic extraction schemes which try to calculate and extract distinct attributes a priori. In this way, our system aids in the knowledge discovery of the interaction of properties within volumetric data.","article_number":"6185542","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6185542","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6185542/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6185542/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6363448,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Jan. 2013","start_page":"94","end_page":"107","citing_paper_count":21,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1000,"insert_date":"20120417","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Histograms","Transfer functions","Rendering (computer graphics)","Measurement","Data visualization","Entropy","Image color analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["user centred design","data mining","data visualisation","transfer functions","knowledge discovery","volumetric attribute space abstraction","transfer function exploration","user centered transfer function design","one-dimensional histogram","two-dimensional histogram","attribute space visualization","information metric","multivariate volumetric data","attribute magnitude","attribute information","histogram widget","abstract attribute space representation","mean","standard deviation","entropy","skewness","attribute discovery","automatic extraction schemes","Histograms","Transfer functions","Rendering (computer graphics)","Measurement","Data visualization","Entropy","Image color analysis","information theory","Transfer function design","volume rendering"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Transfer Function","Transfer Function Design","Multivariate Data","Multivariate Statistics","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Knowledge Discovery","Volumetric Data","Interactive","Water Vapor","Water Evaporation","Spatial Dimensions","Spatial Attributes","Statistical Properties","Noisy Data","Domain Experts","High Entropy","Scalar Value","CT Data","Histogram Bins","Volume Properties","Intensive Properties","Abstract Space","Vortex Core","Uniform Random Distribution","Information Metrics","2D Histogram","View Direction","Volume Rendering","Volumetric Rendering","Time-varying Data","High Skewness","Approximate Entropy","Entropy Calculation","Entropy Estimation","Volumetric Features","Volumetric Characteristics","Turbulent Flow","Multidimensional Function","Multidimensional Map"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.117","title":"Activity Detection in Scientific Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"3","issn":"2160-9306","rank":187,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Vizlab, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38012786400","id":38012786400,"full_name":"Sedat Ozer","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Vizlab, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ"]}},{"affiliation":"Vizlab, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274132700","id":37274132700,"full_name":"Deborah Silver","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Vizlab, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Marine & Coastal Sciences, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282733100","id":37282733100,"full_name":"Karen Bemis","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Marine & Coastal Sciences, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Aerospace Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38238798500","id":38238798500,"full_name":"Pino Martin","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Aerospace Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"For large-scale simulations, the data sets are so massive that it is sometimes not feasible to view the data with basic visualization methods, let alone explore all time steps in detail.

In part, this is due to the large, unstructured, adaptive resolution characteristics of the meshes used in the modeling and simulation process. Out of the wide variety of existing flow field visualization techniques, vector field clustering algorithms offer the advantage of capturing a detailed picture of important areas of the domain while presenting a simplified view of areas of less importance. This paper presents a novel, robust, automatic vector field clustering algorithm that produces intuitive and insightful images of vector fields on large, unstructured, adaptive resolution boundary meshes from CFD. Our bottom-up, hierarchical approach is the first to combine the properties of the underlying vector field and mesh into a unified error-driven representation. The motivation behind the approach is the fact that CFD engineers may increase the resolution of model meshes according to importance. The algorithm has several advantages. Clusters are generated automatically, no surface parameterization is required, and large meshes are processed efficiently. The most suggestive and important information contained in the meshes and vector fields is preserved while less important areas are simplified in the visualization. Users can interactively control the level of detail by adjusting a range of clustering distance measure parameters. We describe two data structures to accelerate the clustering process. We also introduce novel visualizations of clusters inspired by statistical methods.

Both methods lead to discrete filters, which can be combined with continuous reconstruction kernels to yield highly accurate estimators as compared to the current state of the art.

This paper introduces an integrated pipeline for highly effective wind and force field analysis and visualization. We extract vortices induced by a turbine's rotation in a wind field, and characterize vortices in conjunction with numerically simulated forces on the blade surfaces as these vortices strike another turbine's blades downstream. The scientifically relevant issue to be studied is the relationship between the extracted, approximate locations on the blades where vortices strike the blades and the forces that exist in those locations. This integrated approach is used to detect and analyze turbulent flow that causes local impact on the wind turbine blade structure. The results that we present are based on analyzing the wind and force field data sets generated by numerical simulations, and allow domain scientists to relate vortex-blade interactions with power output loss in turbines and turbine life expectancy. Our methods have the potential to improve turbine design to save costs related to turbine operation and maintenance.","article_number":"6461884","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6461884","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6461884/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6461884/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6558748,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Sept. 2013","start_page":"1579","end_page":"1591","citing_paper_count":14,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":937,"insert_date":"20130214","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Blades","Wind turbines","Data visualization","Feature extraction","Force","Geometry"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Flow visualization","applications","wind energy","turbulence","vortices"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Wind Farm","Intersectional Analysis","Output Power","Turbulent Flow","Wind Turbine","Wind Field","Operation And Maintenance","Turbine Blades","Simulated Force","Wind Turbine Blades","Turbine Rotor","Time Step","Visual System","Global Features","Global Characteristics","Global Quality","Tetragonal","Quadrilateral","Flow Field","Wind Power","Wind Energy","Wind Generation","Force Values","Color Map","Axial Force","Low-level Jet","Vortex Core","Number Of Intersections","Large Eddy Simulation","Plane Rotation","Aerodynamic Loads","Value Of Radius","Values Of Radii","Los Alamos National Laboratory","Atmospheric Turbulence","Intersection Region"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.81","title":"Grouper: A Compact, Streamable Triangle Mesh Data Structure","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":192,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Visualization Graphics and Usability Center","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086628504","id":37086628504,"full_name":"Mark Luffel","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visualization Graphics and Usability Center"]}},{"affiliation":"Visualization Graphics and Usability Center","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086628775","id":37086628775,"full_name":"Topraj Gurung","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visualization Graphics and Usability Center"]}},{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC), Livermore, CA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37269320000","id":37269320000,"full_name":"Peter Lindstrom","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC), Livermore, CA"]}},{"affiliation":"Visualization Graphics and Usability Center","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267045200","id":37267045200,"full_name":"Jarek Rossignac","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visualization Graphics and Usability Center"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present Grouper: an all-in-one compact file format, random-access data structure, and streamable representation for large triangle meshes. Similarly to the recently published SQuad representation, Grouper represents the geometry and connectivity of a mesh by grouping vertices and triangles into fixed-size records, most of which store two adjacent triangles and a shared vertex. Unlike SQuad, however, Grouper interleaves geometry with connectivity and uses a new connectivity representation to ensure that vertices and triangles can be stored in a coherent order that enables memory-efficient sequential stream processing. We present a linear-time construction algorithm that allows streaming out Grouper meshes using a small memory footprint while preserving the initial ordering of vertices. As a part of this construction, we show how the problem of assigning vertices and triangles to groups reduces to a well-known NP-hard optimization problem, and present a simple yet effective heuristic solution that performs well in practice. Our array-based Grouper representation also doubles as a triangle mesh data structure that allows direct access to vertices and triangles. Storing only about two integer references per triangleâi.e., less than the three vertex references stored with each triangle in a conventional indexed mesh format-Grouper answers both incidence and adjacency queries in amortized constant time. Our compact representation enables data-parallel processing on multicore computers, instant partitioning and fast transmission for distributed processing, as well as efficient out-of-core access. We demonstrate the versatility and performance benefits of Grouper using a suite of example meshes and processing kernels.","article_number":"6515117","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6515117","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6515117/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6515117/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6674934,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"Jan. 2014","start_page":"84","end_page":"98","citing_paper_count":13,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":795,"insert_date":"20130513","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Random processes","Mathematical model","File formats","Mesh generation","Algorithm design and analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Mesh compression","mesh data structures","random access","out-of-core algorithms","large meshes"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Structure","Triangular Mesh","Triangle Mesh","Direct Access","Stream Processing","Construction Algorithm","Large Meshes","Ordering Of The Vertices","Vertex Order","Pairing","Global Index","Global Indices","Relative Index","Relative Indices","Direct Modulation","Random Access","Binary Format","Storage Cost","Caching","Single Direction","Least Significant Bit","Low Bit","Dynamic Management","Maximum Independent Set","Independence Number","Independent Set Problem","Compressed Format","Output Stream","Vertex Coordinates","Coordinates Of Vertices","Dual Graph","Mesh Vertices","Mesh Vertex","Bit-shift","Bit-shift Operations","Mesh Representation","Reference Count","Virtual Memory","Mesh Generation","Grid Generation","Mesh Formation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.110","title":"A 2D Flow Visualization User Study Using Explicit Flow Synthesis and Implicit Task Design","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"5","issn":"2160-9306","rank":193,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Kentucky State University, Frankfort, KY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37671605200","id":37671605200,"full_name":"Zhanping Liu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Kentucky State University, Frankfort, KY, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Center for Risk Studies and Safety, University of California at Santa Barbara, Goleta, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37392412300","id":37392412300,"full_name":"Shangshu Cai","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Center for Risk Studies and Safety, University of California at Santa Barbara, Goleta, CA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Mississippi State University, MS","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085965535","id":37085965535,"full_name":"J.

To reduce data-related bias, template-based explicit flow synthesis was used to create a wide variety of symmetric flows with similar topological complexity. To suppress task-related bias, pattern-based implicit task design was employed, addressing critical point recognition, critical point classification, and symmetric pattern categorization. In addition, variable-duration and fixed-duration measurement schemes were utilized for lightweight precision-critical and heavyweight judgment-intensive flow analysis tasks, respectively, to record visualization effectiveness. We eliminated outliers and used the Ryan REGWQ post-hoc homogeneous subset tests in statistical analysis to obtain reliable findings. Our study shows that a texture-based dense representation with accentuated flow streaks, such as enhanced LIC, enables intuitive perception of the flow, while a geometry-based integral representation with uniform density control, such as evenly spaced streamlines, may exploit visual interpolation to facilitate mental reconstruction of the flow.

The key light provides both lighting effects and carries the visual cues for the perception of local and global shapes and depth. The cues for local shapes are conveyed by gradient; those for global shapes are carried by shadows; and those for depth are provided by shadows and translucent objects. Fill lights produce global effects to increase the perceptibility. Detail lights generate local effects to improve the cues for local shapes. Our method quantifies the perception and uses an exhaustive search to set the lights. It configures accessory lights with the consideration of preserving the global impression conveyed by the key light. It ensures the feeling of smooth light movements in animations. With simplification, it achieves interactive frame rates and produces results that are visually indistinguishable from results using the nonsimplified algorithm.

It helps analysts establish causality, build storylines from evidence, and reject infeasible hypotheses. For this reason, many investigative analysis tools provide visual representations designed for making sense of temporal data. However, the field of visual analytics still needs more evidence explaining how temporal visualization actually aids the analysis process, as well as design recommendations for how to build these visualizations. To fill this gap, we conducted an insight-based qualitative study to investigate the influence of temporal visualization on investigative analysis. We found that visualizing temporal information helped participants externalize chains of events. Another contribution of our work is the lightweight evaluation approach used to collect, visualize, and analyze insight.","article_number":"6171184","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6171184","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6171184/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6171184/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6297391,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Nov. 2012","start_page":"1992","end_page":"2004","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":521,"insert_date":"20120319","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Data visualization","Recycling","Particle measurements","Atmospheric measurements","Educational institutions"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Qualitative evaluation","investigative analysis","temporal visualization","insight-based evaluation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Collection Of Papers","Document Collection","Visual Representation","Visual Analysis","Temporal Information","Temporal Data","Social Sciences","Participants In Group","Related Information","Visualization Tool","Temporal Analysis","Chronological Order","Temporal Order","Visual Evaluation","Visual Rating","Order Of Events","Main Plot","Plot Points","Points In Each Plot","Intelligence Analysis","Engineering Students","External Aid","Intelligence Reports","Visual Analytics Tool","Time-varying Data","Screen Capture","Clickstream","Intelligence Analysts","Visual Information","Thinking","Thoughts","Sequence Of Events","Entity Types"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.100","title":"A Deformation Framework for Focus+Context Flow Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":197,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086054207","id":37086054207,"full_name":"Jun Tao","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37405886900","id":37405886900,"full_name":"Chaoli Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37443650300","id":37443650300,"full_name":"Ching-Kuang Shene","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Mechanical Engineering-Engineering Mechanics, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085755417","id":37085755417,"full_name":"Seung Hyun Kim","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering-Engineering Mechanics, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Striking a careful balance among coverage, occlusion, and complexity is a resounding theme in the visual understanding of large and complex three-dimensional flow fields. In this paper, we present a novel deformation framework for focus+context streamline visualization that reduces occlusion and clutter around the focal regions while compacting the context region in a full view. Unlike existing techniques that vary streamline densities, we advocate a different approach that manipulates streamline positions. This is achieved by partitioning the flow field's volume space into blocks and deforming the blocks to guide streamline repositioning. We formulate block expansion and block smoothing into energy terms and solve for a deformed grid that minimizes the objective function under the volume boundary and edge flipping constraints. Leveraging a GPU linear system solver, we demonstrate interactive focus+context visualization with 3D flow field data of various characteristics. Compared to the fisheye focus+context technique, our method can magnify multiple streamlines of focus in different regions simultaneously while minimizing the distortion through optimized deformation. Both automatic and manual feature specifications are provided for flexible focus selection and effective visualization.","article_number":"6559983","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6559983","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6559983/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6559983/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6674934,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"Jan. 2014","start_page":"42","end_page":"55","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":836,"insert_date":"20130716","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Entropy","Visualization","Smoothing methods","Data visualization","Context","Manuals","Shape"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Flow visualization","focus+context visualization","optimized deformation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Flow Visualization","Deformation Framework","Magnification","Smoothing","Objective Function","Linear System","Flow Field","Focal Region","Regional Focus","3D Flow","Scaling Factor","Outer Layer","User Study","Energy Function","Flow Patterns","Entropy Values","Grid Resolution","Important Ones","Central Volume","Central Intensity","Volume Exchange","Small Features","Deformation Process","Automatic Evaluation","Number Of Streamlines","Value Of Block","Value Of Each Block","Internal Flow","Fisheye Lens","Wide-angle Lens","Fisheye Camera","Fisheye Lenses","Vertex Position","Positions Of Vertices","Large Distortion","Neighboring Vertices","Neighborhood Of A Vertex","Neighbors Of Vertex","Crayfish","Flow Characteristics","Flow Features"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.90","title":"Link Conditions for Simplifying Meshes with Embedded Structures","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"7","issn":"2160-9306","rank":198,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Automation, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38258503300","id":38258503300,"full_name":"Dilip Mathew Thomas","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Automation, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Automation, Supercomputer Education and Research Centre, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37278509300","id":37278509300,"full_name":"Vijay Natarajan","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Automation, Supercomputer Education and Research Centre, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"]}},{"affiliation":"LJK, INRIA Grenoble, University of Grenoble, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37368609100","id":37368609100,"full_name":"Georges-Pierre Bonneau","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["LJK, INRIA Grenoble, University of Grenoble, France"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Interactive visualization applications benefit from simplification techniques that generate good-quality coarse meshes from high-resolution meshes that represent the domain. These meshes often contain interesting substructures, called embedded structures, and it is desirable to preserve the topology of the embedded structures during simplification, in addition to preserving the topology of the domain. This paper describes a proof that link conditions, proposed earlier, are sufficient to ensure that edge contractions preserve the topology of the embedded structures and the domain. Excluding two specific configurations, the link conditions are also shown to be necessary for topology preservation. Repeated application of edge contraction on an extended complex produces a coarser representation of the domain and the embedded structures. An extension of the quadric error metric is used to schedule edge contractions, resulting in a good-quality coarse mesh that closely approximates the input domain and the embedded structures.","article_number":"5487514","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5487514","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5487514/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5487514/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5762828,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"July 2011","start_page":"1007","end_page":"1019","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":384,"insert_date":"20100617","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Topology","Computer science","Automation","Visualization","Mesh generation","Iterative methods","Joining processes","Supercomputers","Computer science education","Geophysics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Embedded structures","extended complex","link conditions","mesh simplification","topology preservation","quadric error metric."]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Simple Technique","Error Metrics","Structural Embeddedness","Root Mean Square Error","Root-mean-square Deviation","RMSD","RMSE","Mean Square Error","Mean Square Deviation","Magnetic Field","Simplex","Simplicial","Simple Algorithm","Fullerene","Molecules In Solution","3D Mesh","Surface Mesh","Molecular Surface","Isosurface","Seismic Waves","Seismic Velocity","Seismic Energy","Triangular Mesh","Triangle Mesh","Simplicial Complex","Outer Envelope","Tetrahedral Mesh","Mesh Vertices","Mesh Vertex","Affine Space","Affinely Independent","Magnetic Field Generation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.113","title":"A Versatile Optical Model for Hybrid Rendering of Volume Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":199,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37598908000","id":37598908000,"full_name":"Fei Yang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of Hull, Hull, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37596483100","id":37596483100,"full_name":"Qingde Li","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Hull, Hull, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37587449900","id":37587449900,"full_name":"Dehui Xiang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37576808300","id":37576808300,"full_name":"Yong Cao","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37290885500","id":37290885500,"full_name":"Jie Tian","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In volume rendering, most optical models currently in use are based on the assumptions that a volumetric object is a collection of particles and that the macro behavior of particles, when they interact with light rays, can be predicted based on the behavior of each individual particle. However, such models are not capable of characterizing the collective optical effect of a collection of particles which dominates the appearance of the boundaries of dense objects. In this paper, we propose a generalized optical model that combines particle elements and surface elements together to characterize both the behavior of individual particles and the collective effect of particles. The framework based on a new model provides a more powerful and flexible tool for hybrid rendering of isosurfaces and transparent clouds of particles in a single scene. It also provides a more rational basis for shading, so the problem of normal-based shading in homogeneous regions encountered in conventional volume rendering can be easily avoided. The model can be seen as an extension to the classical model. It can be implemented easily, and most of the advanced numerical estimation methods previously developed specifically for the particle-based optical model, such as preintegration, can be applied to the new model to achieve high-quality rendering results.","article_number":"5928339","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5928339","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5928339/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5928339/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6180049,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"June 2012","start_page":"925","end_page":"937","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":690,"insert_date":"20110623","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Isosurfaces","Mathematical model","Solid modeling","Equations","Numerical models","Transfer functions"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Direct volume rendering","optical models","isosurfaces","preintegration","ray casting","transfer function."]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Optical Model","Homogeneous Regions","Regional Homogeneity","Isosurface","Surface Elements","Behavior Of Particles","Light Rays","Ray Optics","Volume Rendering","Volumetric Rendering","Single Scene","Illumination","Lighting","Transfer Function","Normal Vector","Hybrid Model","Lookup Table","Delta Function","Dirac Delta","Dirac Function","Dirac Distribution","Dirac Delta Function","Color Word","Color-naming","Scalar Value","Gradient Magnitude","Light Attenuation","Number Of Surfaces","Kinds Of Particles","Ray Casting","Ray Shooting","Surface Normal Vector","RGB Color Space","Wavelength Dependence","Volume Dataset","Volume Data Sets","Pure Particles","Objective In Mind","Well-defined Objectives","Acceleration Techniques"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.87","title":"The Sinogram Polygonizer for Reconstructing 3D Shapes","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"11","issn":"2160-9306","rank":200,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Precision Engineering and RCAST, University of Tokyo, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073865700","id":37073865700,"full_name":"Daiki Yamanaka","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Precision Engineering and RCAST, University of Tokyo, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Precision Engineering and RCAST, University of Tokyo, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284003500","id":37284003500,"full_name":"Yutaka Ohtake","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Precision Engineering and RCAST, University of Tokyo, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"]}},{"affiliation":"RCAST, University of Tokyo, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274659000","id":37274659000,"full_name":"Hiromasa Suzuki","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["RCAST, University of Tokyo, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel approach, the sinogram polygonizer, for directly reconstructing 3D shapes from sinograms (i.e., the primary output from X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanners consisting of projection image sequences of an object shown from different viewing angles). To obtain a polygon mesh approximating the surface of a scanned object, a grid-based isosurface polygonizer, such as Marching Cubes, has been conventionally applied to the CT volume reconstructed from a sinogram. In contrast, the proposed method treats CT values as a continuous function and directly extracts a triangle mesh based on tetrahedral mesh deformation. This deformation involves quadratic error metric minimization and optimal Delaunay triangulation for the generation of accurate, high-quality meshes. Thanks to the analytical gradient estimation of CT values, sharp features are well approximated, even though the generated mesh is very coarse. Moreover, this approach eliminates aliasing artifacts on triangle meshes.","article_number":"6520857","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6520857","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6520857/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6520857/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6595509,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Nov. 2013","start_page":"1911","end_page":"1922","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":720,"insert_date":"20130527","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Computed tomography","Image reconstruction","X-ray imaging","Surface reconstruction","Three-dimensional displays","Isosurfaces","Materials"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Shape reconstruction","X-ray CT","sinogram","isosurface polygonizer","mesh generation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Computed Tomography","Computed Tomography Scan","CT Scan","Gradient Approximation","Gradient Estimation","Viewing Angle","Projection Images","3D Mesh","Surface Mesh","Isosurface","X-ray Computed Tomography","Triangular Mesh","Triangle Mesh","Delaunay Triangulation","Tetrahedral Mesh","Computed Tomography Value","Computed Tomography Volumes","Computation Time","Calculation Time","Image Reconstruction","Iterative Reconstruction","Tomographic Reconstruction","Singular Value","Bounding Box","Regular Grid","Cartesian Grid","Grid Structure","Rectangular Grid","Types Of Algorithms","3D Coordinates","3D Coordinate System","Arbitrary Point","Volumetric Model","Differences In Coordination","Deviation Of Coordinates","Filtered Back Projection","Projection Values","Direct Reconstruction","Back Projection","Mesh Generation","Grid Generation","Mesh Vertices","Mesh Vertex","Sobel Operator","Sobel Filter","Accurate Normalization"]}}}]}
