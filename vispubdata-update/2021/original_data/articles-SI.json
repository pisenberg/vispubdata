However, existing rule-based approaches require tedious manual specifications of visualization rules by visualization experts. Other machine learning-based approaches often work like black-box and are difficult to understand why a specific visualization is recommended, limiting the wider adoption of these approaches. This paper fills the gap by presenting KG4Vis, a knowledge graph (KG)-based approach for visualization recommendation. It does not require manual specifications of visualization rules and can also guarantee good explainability. Specifically, we propose a framework for building knowledge graphs, consisting of three types of entities (i.e., data features, data columns and visualization design choices) and the relations between them, to model the mapping rules between data and effective visualizations. A TransE-based embedding technique is employed to learn the embeddings of both entities and relations of the knowledge graph from existing dataset-visualization pairs. Such embeddings intrinsically model the desirable visualization rules. Then, given a new dataset, effective visualizations can be inferred from the knowledge graph with semantically meaningful rules. We conducted extensive evaluations to assess the proposed approach, including quantitative comparisons, case studies and expert interviews. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","article_number":"9552844","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552844","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552844/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552844/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"195","end_page":"205","citing_paper_count":44,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2847,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Feature extraction","Tools","Manuals","Data models","Visualization","Interviews"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization recommendation","Knowledge graph"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visualization Recommendation","Characteristics Of Data","Features Of Data","Data Visualization","Black Box","Design Choices","General Utility","General Usage","Expert Interviews","Automatic Generation","Entity Types","Visual Design","Rule-based Approach","Rules-based Approach","Boxplots","Quantitative Evaluation","Negative Samples","Feature Classification","Categorical Features","Neural Model","Learning Rule","Rule Induction","Continuous Features","Continuous Characteristics","Related Classes","Embedding Vectors","Rule-based Methods","Rule-based Method","Embedding Learning","Rotation In Space","Type Of Visualization","ML-based Methods","ML-based Method","Values In Column","List Of Rules","Empirical Rules","Three-sigma","3-sigma","Three-sigma Rule","Line Chart","Top Choice"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114848","title":"Natural Language to Visualization by Neural Machine Translation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":2,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086509322","id":37086509322,"full_name":"Yuyu Luo","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"QCRI, Hamad Bin Khalifa University, Qatar","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38057424300","id":38057424300,"full_name":"Nan Tang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["QCRI, Hamad Bin Khalifa University, Qatar"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37405540900","id":37405540900,"full_name":"Guoliang Li","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"American School of Doha, Doha, Qatar","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089208884","id":37089208884,"full_name":"Jiawei Tang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["American School of Doha, Doha, Qatar"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086506136","id":37086506136,"full_name":"Chengliang Chai","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086509408","id":37086509408,"full_name":"Xuedi Qin","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Supporting the translation from natural language (NL) query to visualization (NL2VIS) can simplify the creation of data visualizations because if successful, anyone can generate visualizations by their natural language from the tabular data. The state-of-the-art NL2VIS approaches (e.g., NL4DV and FlowSense) are based on semantic parsers and heuristic algorithms, which are not end-to-end and are not designed for supporting (possibly) complex data transformations. Deep neural network powered neural machine translation models have made great strides in many machine translation tasks, which suggests that they might be viable for NL2VIS as well. In this paper, we present ncNet, a Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model for supporting NL2VIS, with several novel visualization-aware optimizations, including using attention-forcing to optimize the learning process, and visualization-aware rendering to produce better visualization results. To enhance the capability of machine to comprehend natural language queries, ncNet is also designed to take an optional chart template (e.g., a pie chart or a scatter plot) as an additional input, where the chart template will be served as a constraint to limit what could be visualized. We conducted both quantitative evaluation and user study, showing that ncNet achieves good accuracy in the nvBench benchmark and is easy-to-use.","article_number":"9617561","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9617561","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9617561/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9617561/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"217","end_page":"226","citing_paper_count":40,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2166,"insert_date":"20211116","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Natural languages","Bars","Deep learning","Machine translation","Visualization","Transformers"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Natural language interface","data visualization","neural machine translation","chart template"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Natural Language","Machine Translation","Neural Machine Translation","Benchmark","Neural Network","Deep Neural Network","Data Visualization","User Study","Pie Chart","Translation Task","Training Set","Deep Learning","Transformer","Deep Learning Models","Long Short-term Memory","Long Short Term Memory","LSTM","Recurrent Neural Network","Attention Mechanism","Multi-head Attention","Highest Probability","Input Sequence","Bar Charts","Seq2seq Model","Tokenized","Chart Types","Natural Language Understanding","Sequence Of Words","Special Token","Input Tokens","Attention Matrix","Attention Matrices","Part-of-speech","Part Of Speech","Word Class","Word Category","Beam Search"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114835","title":"What's the Situation with Situated Visualization?

The concept has gained interest from multiple research communities, including visualization, human-computer interaction (HCI) and augmented reality. This has led to a range of explorations and applications of the concept, however, this early work has focused on the operational aspect of situatedness leading to inconsistent adoption of the concept and terminology. First, we contribute a literature survey in which we analyze 44 papers that explicitly use the term “situated visualization” to provide an overview of the research area, how it defines situated visualization, common application areas and technology used, as well as type of data and type of visualizations. Our survey shows that research on situated visualization has focused on technology-centric approaches that foreground a spatial understanding of situatedness. Secondly, we contribute five perspectives on situatedness (space, time, place, activity, and community) that together expand on the prevalent notion of situatedness in the corpus. We draw from six case studies and prior theoretical developments in HCI. Each perspective develops a generative way of looking at and working with situatedness in design and research. We outline future directions, including considering technology, material and aesthetics, leveraging the perspectives for design, and methods for stronger engagement with target audiences. We conclude with opportunities to consolidate situated visualization research.","article_number":"9552238","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552238","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552238/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552238/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"107","end_page":"117","citing_paper_count":36,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2125,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Human computer interaction","Encoding","Visual analytics","Terminology","Keyword search","Augmented reality"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Situated visualization","literature survey","situatedness"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Situated Visualization","Research Community","Literature Survey","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Multiple Communities","Type Of Visualization","Data Visualization","Spatial Features","Spatial Characteristics","Temporality","Active People","Context Of Use","Applicability Domain","Application Domains","Local Issues","Participatory Design","User Design","Community Perspectives","Visual Design","Limited Engagement","Corpus Analysis","Material Circumstances","Physicalism","Shared Practices","Cultural Conventions","Building Information Modelling","Human–computer Interaction Research","Human Computer Interaction Research","Augmented Reality Applications","Augmented Reality Technology","Design Method","Design Methods","Wall-clock","Wall Clock","Cross-case Analysis","Case Study Analysis"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114861","title":"TIVEE: Visual Exploration and Explanation of Badminton Tactics in Immersive Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":4,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655788","id":37088655788,"full_name":"Xiangtong Chu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","Department of Sport Science, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Sport Science, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086448603","id":37086448603,"full_name":"Xiao Xie","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Sport Science, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656280","id":37088656280,"full_name":"Shuainan Ye","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089951584","id":37089951584,"full_name":"Haolin Lu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085836306","id":37085836306,"full_name":"Hongguang Xiao","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/235740158116925","id":235740158116925,"full_name":"Zeqing Yuan","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Cognitive Science and Design Lab, University of California San Diego, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37090037186","id":37090037186,"full_name":"Chen Zhu-Tian","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Cognitive Science and Design Lab, University of California San Diego, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Sport Science, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086236404","id":37086236404,"full_name":"Hui Zhang","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Sport Science, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","id":37407308300,"full_name":"Yingcai Wu","author_order":9,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Tactic analysis is a major issue in badminton as the effective usage of tactics is the key to win. The tactic in badminton is defined as a sequence of consecutive strokes. Most existing methods use statistical models to find sequential patterns of strokes and apply 2D visualizations such as glyphs and statistical charts to explore and analyze the discovered patterns. However, in badminton, spatial information like the shuttle trajectory, which is inherently 3D, is the core of a tactic. The lack of sufficient spatial awareness in 2D visualizations largely limited the tactic analysis of badminton. In this work, we collaborate with domain experts to study the tactic analysis of badminton in a 3D environment and propose an immersive visual analytics system, TIVEE, to assist users in exploring and explaining badminton tactics from multi-levels. Users can first explore various tactics from the third-person perspective using an unfolded visual presentation of stroke sequences. By selecting a tactic of interest, users can turn to the first-person perspective to perceive the detailed kinematic characteristics and explain its effects on the game result. The effectiveness and usefulness of TIVEE are demonstrated by case studies and an expert interview.","article_number":"9557225","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9557225","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9557225/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9557225/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"118","end_page":"128","citing_paper_count":35,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2088,"insert_date":"20240312","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Trajectory","Sports","Three-dimensional displays","Data visualization","Visualization","Games","Layout"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Tactic analysis","stroke sequence visualization","immersive visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Immersive Visualization","Visual Analysis","Domain Experts","First-person Perspective","Third-person Perspective","2D Visualization","Immersive System","Consecutive Stroke","Athletes","Left Hand","Sinistral","Cognitive Load","Cognitive Demands","Mental Workload","Mental Effort","3D Space","3-dimensional Space","Usage Rate","Detailed Observations","Previous Stroke","Immersive Environment","Visual Design","Table Tennis","Teleportation","Defensive Tactics","Defensive Maneuvers","Control Tactics","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Game Situations","First-person View","Game Scenario","Similar Tactics"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114794","title":"M2Lens: Visualizing and Explaining Multimodal Models for Sentiment Analysis","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":5,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Science and Technology, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101987","id":37087101987,"full_name":"Xingbo Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Science and Technology, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Science and Technology, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089208073","id":37089208073,"full_name":"Jianben He","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Science and Technology, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Science and Technology, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102162","id":37087102162,"full_name":"Zhihua Jin","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Science and Technology, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Carnegie Mellon University, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088488756","id":37088488756,"full_name":"Muqiao Yang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Carnegie Mellon University, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089654484","id":37089654484,"full_name":"Yong Wang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Science and Technology, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Science and Technology, United States"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Multimodal sentiment analysis aims to recognize people's attitudes from multiple communication channels such as verbal content (i.e., text), voice, and facial expressions. It has become a vibrant and important research topic in natural language processing. Much research focuses on modeling the complex intra- and inter-modal interactions between different communication channels. However, current multimodal models with strong performance are often deep-learning-based techniques and work like black boxes. It is not clear how models utilize multimodal information for sentiment predictions. Despite recent advances in techniques for enhancing the explainability of machine learning models, they often target unimodal scenarios (e.g., images, sentences), and little research has been done on explaining multimodal models. In this paper, we present an interactive visual analytics system, M2 Lens, to visualize and explain multimodal models for sentiment analysis. M2 Lens provides explanations on intra- and inter-modal interactions at the global, subset, and local levels. Specifically, it summarizes the influence of three typical interaction types (i.e., dominance, complement, and conflict) on the model predictions. Moreover, M2 Lens identifies frequent and influential multimodal features and supports the multi-faceted exploration of model behaviors from language, acoustic, and visual modalities. Through two case studies and expert interviews, we demonstrate our system can help users gain deep insights into the multimodal models for sentiment analysis.","article_number":"9552921","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552921","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552921/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552921/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"802","end_page":"812","citing_paper_count":27,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2928,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Analytical models","Sentiment analysis","Computational modeling","Predictive models","Data models","Lenses","Communication channels"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Multimodal models","sentiment analysis","explainable machine learning"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Model Analysis","Sentiment Analysis","Sentiment Classification","Multimodal Model","Sentiment Analysis Model","Interactive","Prediction Model","Types Of Interactions","Machine Learning Models","Black Box","Facial Expressions","Unimodal","Visual Modality","Expert Interviews","Multimodal Analysis","Multimodal Features","Language Mode","Negation","Prediction Error","Large Errors","Visual Features","Visual Characteristics","Acoustic Features","Acoustic Characteristics","Projection Views","Positive Sentiment","Exploration Of Features","Exploration Of Characteristics","Template Feature","Facial Action Coding System","Visual Design","Text Sentiment","Textual Features","Cross-modal Interactions"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114832","title":"TacticFlow: Visual Analytics of Ever-Changing Tactics in Racket Sports","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":6,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088755868","id":37088755868,"full_name":"Jiang Wu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088559342","id":37088559342,"full_name":"Dongyu Liu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088750906","id":37088750906,"full_name":"Ziyang Guo","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088757745","id":37088757745,"full_name":"Qingyang Xu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","id":37407308300,"full_name":"Yingcai Wu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Event sequence mining is often used to summarize patterns from hundreds of sequences but faces special challenges when handling racket sports data. In racket sports (e.g., tennis and badminton), a player hitting the ball is considered a multivariate event consisting of multiple attributes (e.g., hit technique and ball position). A rally (i.e., a series of consecutive hits beginning with one player serving the ball and ending with one player winning a point) thereby can be viewed as a multivariate event sequence. Mining frequent patterns and depicting how patterns change over time is instructive and meaningful to players who want to learn more short-term competitive strategies (i.e., tactics) that encompass multiple hits. However, players in racket sports usually change their tactics rapidly according to the opponent's reaction, resulting in ever-changing tactic progression. In this work, we introduce a tailored visualization system built on a novel multivariate sequence pattern mining algorithm to facilitate explorative identification and analysis of various tactics and tactic progression. The algorithm can mine multiple non-overlapping multivariate patterns from hundreds of sequences effectively. Based on the mined results, we propose a glyph-based Sankey diagram to visualize the ever-changing tactic progression and support interactive data exploration. Through two case studies with four domain experts in tennis and badminton, we demonstrate that our system can effectively obtain insights about tactic progression in most racket sports.

However, it is difficult to evaluate the usefulness of these descriptions, and how effectively they improve access to meaningful information, because we have little understanding of the semantic content they convey, and how different readers receive this content. In response, we introduce a conceptual model for the semantic content conveyed by natural language descriptions of visualizations. Developed through a grounded theory analysis of 2,147 sentences, our model spans four levels of semantic content: enumerating visualization construction properties (e.g., marks and encodings); reporting statistical concepts and relations (e.g., extrema and correlations); identifying perceptual and cognitive phenomena (e.g., complex trends and patterns); and elucidating domain-specific insights (e.g., social and political context). To demonstrate how our model can be applied to evaluate the effectiveness of visualization descriptions, we conduct a mixed-methods evaluation with 30 blind and 90 sighted readers, and find that these reader groups differ significantly on which semantic content they rank as most useful. Together, our model and findings suggest that access to meaningful information is strongly reader-specific, and that research in automatic visualization captioning should orient toward descriptions that more richly communicate overall trends and statistics, sensitive to reader preferences. Our work further opens a space of research on natural language as a data interface coequal with visualization.","article_number":"9555469","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555469","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9555469/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9555469/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"1073","end_page":"1083","citing_paper_count":26,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2007,"insert_date":"20210930","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Semantics","Natural languages","Visualization","Guidelines","Data visualization","Media","Graphics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","natural language","description","caption","semantic","model","theory","alt text","blind","disability","accessibility"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Natural Language","Semantic Content","Content Model","Natural Language Descriptions","Grounded Theory","Statistical Concepts","Cognitive Phenomena","Cognitive Phenomenon","High-income Countries","Automatic Method","Automatic Methods","Bar Charts","Filtering Effect","Scalable Vector Graphics","Average Life Expectancy","Average Life Span","Average Lifespan","Mean Lifespan","Contextual Knowledge","Cognitive Context","Visual Elements","Semantic Level","Background Context","Domain-specific Knowledge","Prior Survey","Canonical Type","Blinded Readers","Computational Considerations","Knowledge In Reading","Axis Scale","Chart Types","Axis Labels","Grounded Theory Method","Grounded Theory Methods","Ranking Task","Content Categories","Content Classification","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114694","title":"Revisiting Dimensionality Reduction Techniques for Visual Cluster Analysis: An Empirical Study","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":8,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37531405500","id":37531405500,"full_name":"Jiazhi Xia","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086386859","id":37086386859,"full_name":"Yuchen Zhang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089206277","id":37089206277,"full_name":"Jie Song","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"I4 data, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087502906","id":37087502906,"full_name":"Yang Chen","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["I4 data, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085804605","id":37085804605,"full_name":"Yunhai Wang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Software, Tsinghua University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406039100","id":37406039100,"full_name":"Shixia Liu","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Software, Tsinghua University, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Dimensionality Reduction (DR) techniques can generate 2D projections and enable visual exploration of cluster structures of high-dimensional datasets.

Informed by the design space and close collaboration with domain experts, we design VisCommentator, a fast prototyping tool, to eases the creation of augmented table tennis videos by leveraging machine learning-based data extractors and design space-based visualization recommendations. With VisCommentator, sports analysts can create an augmented video by selecting the data to visualize instead of manually drawing the graphical marks. Our system can be generalized to other racket sports (e.g., tennis, badminton) once the underlying datasets and models are available.

However, recovering causal relations from these observations to explain the sources of urban phenomena remains a challenging task because these causal relations tend to be time-varying and demand proper time series partitioning for effective analyses. The prior approaches extract one causal graph given long-time observations, which cannot be directly applied to capturing, interpreting, and validating dynamic urban causality. This paper presents Compass, a novel visual analytics approach for in-depth analyses of the dynamic causality in urban time series. To develop Compass, we identify and address three challenges: detecting urban causality, interpreting dynamic causal relations, and unveiling suspicious causal relations. First, multiple causal graphs over time among urban time series are obtained with a causal detection framework extended from the Granger causality test. Then, a dynamic causal graph visualization is designed to reveal the time-varying causal relations across these causal graphs and facilitate the exploration of the graphs along the time. Finally, a tailored multi-dimensional visualization is developed to support the identification of spurious causal relations, thereby improving the reliability of causal analyses. The effectiveness of Compass is evaluated with two case studies conducted on the real-world urban datasets, including the air pollution and traffic speed datasets, and positive feedback was received from domain experts.","article_number":"9557222","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9557222","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9557222/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9557222/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"1051","end_page":"1061","citing_paper_count":21,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1959,"insert_date":"20211001","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Time series analysis","Visual analytics","Compass","Air pollution","Correlation","Urban planning","Indexes"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual causal analysis","urban time series","causal graph analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Time Series","Time-series","Compassion","Time Series Analysis","Time-series Analysis","Causal Analysis","Causal Relationship","Air Pollution","Visual Analysis","Traffic Congestion","Traffic Density","Traffic Jams","Traffic Flow","Vehicular Traffic","Traffic Speed","Real-world Datasets","Real-world Data Sets","Granger Causality","Granger-causality","Visibility Graph","Causality Test","Visual Approach","Granger Causality Test","Dynamic Graph","Causal Framework","Multiple Graphs","Causal Graph","Causal Dynamics","Map View","O2 Sensor","Urban Data","Time Window","Remote Sensing","Remote-sensing","Direct Cause","Vector Autoregressive Model","Structural Vector Autoregression","VAR Model","Vector Autoregressive","Traffic Dataset","Traffic Data Set","Real-world Case Study","Real World Case Study","User Requirements"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114865","title":"KD-Box: Line-segment-based KD-tree for Interactive Exploration of Large-scale Time-Series Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":14,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Shandong University, Qingdao, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089207216","id":37089207216,"full_name":"Yue Zhao","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shandong University, Qingdao, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Shandong University, Qingdao, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085804605","id":37085804605,"full_name":"Yunhai Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shandong University, Qingdao, China"]}},{"affiliation":"CNIC, CAS., United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38026660700","id":38026660700,"full_name":"Jian Zhang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["CNIC, CAS., United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Chinese University of Hong Kong, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37336329800","id":37336329800,"full_name":"Chi-Wing Fu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Chinese University of Hong Kong, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Zhengzhou University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396970400","id":37396970400,"full_name":"Mingliang Xu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhengzhou University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Carnegie Mellon University, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085711170","id":37085711170,"full_name":"Dominik Moritz","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, United States"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Time-series data-usually presented in the form of lines-plays an important role in many domains such as finance, meteorology, health, and urban informatics.

In this paper, we contribute a novel line-segment-based KD-tree method to enable interactive analysis of many time series. Our method enables not only fast queries over time series in selected regions of interest but also a line splatting method for efficient computation of the density field and selection of representative lines. Further, we develop KD-Box, an interactive system that provides rich interactions, e.g., timebox, attribute filtering, and coordinated multiple views. We demonstrate the effectiveness of KD-Box in supporting efficient line query and density field computation through a quantitative comparison and show its usefulness for interactive visual analysis on several real-world datasets.","article_number":"9552923","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552923","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552923/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552923/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"890","end_page":"900","citing_paper_count":20,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1037,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Time series analysis","Visualization","Rendering (computer graphics)","Market research","Clutter","Three-dimensional displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Many time series","density-based visualization","interactive visualization for large-scale data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Time Series","Time-series","Time Series Data","Time-series Data","Large-scale Data","Large Scale Data","Exploratory Data","Interactive Exploration","Large-scale Time Series Data","Large-scale Time-series Data","Time Series Analysis","Time-series Analysis","Interactive System","Selection Of Lines","Density Field","Line Density","Rich Interactions","Fast Query","Trends Data","Line Segment","Sequence Search","Linear Search","Leaf Node","Line Graph","Number Of Time Points","Number Of Timepoints","Range Of Nodes","Range Of Each Node","Range Query","Line Search","Line-search","Number Of Time Series","Query Results","Representative Time Series","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Set Of Curves","Query Point","Normal Kernel"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114797","title":"IRVINE: A Design Study on Analyzing Correlation Patterns of Electrical Engines","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":15,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Bamberg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088636345","id":37088636345,"full_name":"Joscha Eirich","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bamberg, Germany","BMW Group, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer IWU, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088703256","id":37088703256,"full_name":"Jakob Bonart","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer IWU, Germany","BMW Group, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"BMW Group, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233561600","id":38233561600,"full_name":"Dominik Jäckle","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["BMW Group, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590945600","id":37590945600,"full_name":"Michael Sedlmair","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Bamberg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086312238","id":37086312238,"full_name":"Ute Schmid","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bamberg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Bamberg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37408682900","id":37408682900,"full_name":"Kai Fischbach","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bamberg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Graz University of Technology, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282557600","id":37282557600,"full_name":"Tobias Schreck","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Graz University of Technology, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Zurich, Switzerland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606179600","id":37606179600,"full_name":"Jürgen Bernard","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Zurich, Switzerland"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this design study, we present IRVINE, a Visual Analytics (VA) system, which facilitates the analysis of acoustic data to detect and understand previously unknown errors in the manufacturing of electrical engines. In serial manufacturing processes, signatures from acoustic data provide valuable information on how the relationship between multiple produced engines serves to detect and understand previously unknown errors. To analyze such signatures, IRVINE leverages interactive clustering and data labeling techniques, allowing users to analyze clusters of engines with similar signatures, drill down to groups of engines, and select an engine of interest. Furthermore, IRVINE allows to assign labels to engines and clusters and annotate the cause of an error in the acoustic raw measurement of an engine. Since labels and annotations represent valuable knowledge, they are conserved in a knowledge database to be available for other stakeholders. We contribute a design study, where we developed IRVINE in four main iterations with engineers from a company in the automotive sector. To validate IRVINE, we conducted a field study with six domain experts. Our results suggest a high usability and usefulness of IRVINE as part of the improvement of a real-world manufacturing process. Specifically, with IRVINE domain experts were able to label and annotate produced electrical engines more than 30% faster.","article_number":"9552903","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552903","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552903/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552903/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"11","end_page":"21","citing_paper_count":20,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1447,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Engines","Acoustics","Labeling","Annotations","Task analysis","Automotive engineering","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Design study","interactive labeling","interactive clustering","H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]","User Interfaces—Graphical user interfaces (GUI)","User-centered design"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Electrical Engineering","Electric Motor","Interactive","Usability","Ease Of Use","Domain Experts","Similar Signatures","Raw Measurements","Acoustic Measurements","Acoustic Data","Causes Of Errors","Automotive Sector","Spectroscopic","Spectrogram","Applicability Domain","Application Domains","Bar Charts","Data Abstraction","Acoustic Signals","Anomaly Detection","Internal Combustion Engine","Automotive Engineering","Signature Analysis","Category Labels","Self-organizing Map","Kohonen","Visual Design","Stored Knowledge","Multiple Stations","User Feedback","Inner Ring","Line Chart","Clustering Visualization","Subsets Of Interest","Multiple Technologies","Multiple Engineering"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114855","title":"Where Can We Help?

Deep neural network (DNN) based semantic segmentation models are widely used in autonomous driving. However, it is challenging to evaluate DNN-based models due to their black-box-like nature, and it is even more difficult to assess model performance for crucial objects, such as lost cargos and pedestrians, in autonomous driving applications. In this work, we propose VASS, a Visual Analytics approach to diagnosing and improving the accuracy and robustness of Semantic Segmentation models, especially for critical objects moving in various driving scenes. The key component of our approach is a context-aware spatial representation learning that extracts important spatial information of objects, such as position, size, and aspect ratio, with respect to given scene contexts. Based on this spatial representation, we first use it to create visual summarization to analyze models' performance. We then use it to guide the generation of adversarial examples to evaluate models' spatial robustness and obtain actionable insights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VASS via two case studies of lost cargo detection and pedestrian detection in autonomous driving. For both cases, we show quantitative evaluation on the improvement of models' performance with actionable insights obtained from VASS.","article_number":"9552909","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552909","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552909/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552909/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"1040","end_page":"1050","citing_paper_count":19,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1137,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Semantics","Image segmentation","Autonomous vehicles","Analytical models","Robustness","Visual analytics","Data models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Model diagnosis","semantic segmentation","spatial representation learning","adversarial learning","autonomous driving"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Model Performance","Accuracy Of Model","Deep Neural Network","Spatial Information","Aspect Ratio","Spatial Memory","Spatial Working Memory","Spatial Learning","Visual Analysis","Pedestrian","Representation Learning","Model Improvement","Autonomous Vehicles","Autonomous Driving","Semantic Segmentation","Actual Knowledge","Actionable Insights","Spatial Representation","Semantic Segmentation Models","Adversarial Examples","Critical Object","Pedestrian Detection","Scene Context","Convolutional Neural Network","Bounding Box","Generative Adversarial Networks","Adversarial Learning","Objects In The Scene","Latent Representation","Latent Vector","Potential Vulnerability","Data Generation","Latent Dimensions","Object Motion","Moving Objects","Latent Space","Embedding Space"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114807","title":"Interactive Dimensionality Reduction for Comparative Analysis","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":17,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086133964","id":37086133964,"full_name":"Takanori Fujiwara","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Waterloo, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089215502","id":37089215502,"full_name":"Xinhai Wei","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Waterloo, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Waterloo, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38024987300","id":38024987300,"full_name":"Jian Zhao","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Waterloo, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275869400","id":37275869400,"full_name":"Kwan-Liu Ma","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis, United States"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Finding the similarities and differences between groups of datasets is a fundamental analysis task.

This paper presents an interactive DR framework where we integrate our new DR method, called ULCA (unified linear comparative analysis), with an interactive visual interface. ULCA unifies two DR schemes, discriminant analysis and contrastive learning, to support various comparative analysis tasks. To provide flexibility for comparative analysis, we develop an optimization algorithm that enables analysts to interactively refine ULCA results. Additionally, the interactive visualization interface facilitates interpretation and refinement of the ULCA results. We evaluate ULCA and the optimization algorithm to show their efficiency as well as present multiple case studies using real-world datasets to demonstrate the usefulness of this framework.","article_number":"9555244","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555244","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9555244/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9555244/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"758","end_page":"768","citing_paper_count":19,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1260,"insert_date":"20210930","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Principal component analysis","Visualization","Optimization","Task analysis","Dimensionality reduction","Tools","Libraries"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Dimensionality reduction","discriminant analysis","contrastive learning","comparative analysis","interpretability","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive","Comparative Analysis","Comparison Analysis","Dimensionality Reduction","Optimization Algorithm","Discriminant Analysis","Dimensionality Reduction Methods","Dimensionality Reduction Method","Self-supervised Learning","Contrastive Learning","Groups Of Datasets","Visual Interface","Optimization Problem","Covariance Matrix","Covariance Matrices","Target Group","Linear Discriminant Analysis","Discriminant Function","Discriminant Function Analysis","Time Complexity","Number Of Data Points","Latent Space","Embedding Space","Backward Selection","Projection Matrix","Matrix Operations","Projection Matrices","Latent Features","Latent Characteristics","Linear Dimensionality Reduction","Backward Algorithm","Jupyter Notebook","Locally Linear Embedding","Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction","Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction Method","Confidence Ellipses","Political Opinions","Freedom Of Thought","Freedom Of Conscience","Sum Of Absolute Differences","Visualization Library","Group Variance"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114836","title":"VBridge: Connecting the Dots Between Features and Data to Explain Healthcare Models","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":18,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100335","id":37087100335,"full_name":"Furui Cheng","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088559342","id":37088559342,"full_name":"Dongyu Liu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Adobe Research, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085829363","id":37085829363,"full_name":"Fan Du","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Adobe Research, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656676","id":37088656676,"full_name":"Yanna Lin","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086546930","id":37086546930,"full_name":"Alexandra Zytek","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37935515100","id":37935515100,"full_name":"Haomin Li","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085648060","id":37085648060,"full_name":"Kalyan Veeramachaneni","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Machine learning (ML) is increasingly applied to Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to solve clinical prediction tasks.

But for many people, spreadsheets — the quintessential table tool — remain a critical part of their information ecosystem, allowing them to interact with their data in ways that are hidden or abstracted in more complex tools. This is particularly true for data workers [61], people who work with data as part of their job but do not identify as professional analysts or data scientists. We report on a qualitative study of how these workers interact with and reason about their data. Our findings show that data tables serve a broader purpose beyond data cleanup at the initial stage of a linear analytic flow: users want to see and “get their hands on” the underlying data throughout the analytics process, reshaping and augmenting it to support sensemaking. They reorganize, mark up, layer on levels of detail, and spawn alternatives within the context of the base data. These direct interactions and human-readable table representations form a rich and cognitively important part of building understanding of what the data mean and what they can do with it. We argue that interactive tables are an important visualization idiom in their own right; that the direct data interaction they afford offers a fertile design space for visual analytics; and that sense making can be enriched by more flexible human-data interaction than is currently supported in visual analytics tools.","article_number":"9555457","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555457","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9555457/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9555457/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"686","end_page":"696","citing_paper_count":18,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1470,"insert_date":"20210930","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Tools","Data visualization","Visual analytics","Cleaning","Annotations","Affordances","Organizations"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data practices","Tabular data","Interview study","Visualization","Analytics","Data workers","Sensemaking"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Unreasonable Effectiveness","Interactive","Analytical Tools","Visual Analysis","Clean Data","Visualization Tool","Data In Way","Information Landscape","Information Ecology","Information Ecosystem","Flexible Interaction","Visual Analytics Tool","Data Structure","Audio Recordings","Sound Recordings","Visual Representation","Affordances","Direct Use","Direct Utilization","Direct Manipulation","Spatial Organization","Kinds Of Data","Summary Table","Eyeball","Copy And Paste","Copy-and-paste","Marginalia","Marginal Notes","Marginal Annotations","Feeling Of Ownership","Everyday Work","Spot Checks","Limit Of Blank","Blank Values","Regular Expressions","Regex","Workflow","Mental Models","Google Analytics"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114846","title":"Communicating Visualizations without Visuals: Investigation of Visualization Alternative Text for People with Visual Impairments","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":20,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Wisconsin-Madison, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089205312","id":37089205312,"full_name":"Crescentia Jung","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Wisconsin-Madison, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Wisconsin-Madison, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089206707","id":37089206707,"full_name":"Shubham Mehta","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Wisconsin-Madison, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Wisconsin-Madison, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086864941","id":37086864941,"full_name":"Atharva Kulkarni","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Wisconsin-Madison, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Wisconsin-Madison, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089207164","id":37089207164,"full_name":"Yuhang Zhao","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Wisconsin-Madison, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Wisconsin-Madison, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086229639","id":37086229639,"full_name":"Yea-Seul Kim","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Wisconsin-Madison, United States"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Alternative text is critical in communicating graphics to people who are blind or have low vision.

Given a data table, data workers usually need to experience a tedious and time-consuming process to select meaningful combinations of data columns for creating charts. This process is further complicated by the needs of creating dashboards composed of multiple views that unveil different perspectives of data. Existing automated approaches for recommending multiple-view visualizations mainly build on manually crafted design rules, producing sub-optimal or irrelevant suggestions. To address this gap, we present a deep learning approach for selecting data columns and recommending multiple charts. More importantly, we integrate the deep learning models into a mixed-initiative system. Our model could make recommendations given optional user-input selections of data columns. The model, in turn, learns from provenance data of authoring logs in an offline manner. We compare our deep learning model with existing methods for visualization recommendation and conduct a user study to evaluate the usefulness of the system.","article_number":"9552449","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552449","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552449/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552449/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"162","end_page":"172","citing_paper_count":17,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1527,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Encoding","Deep learning","Tools","Measurement","Layout"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization Recommendation","Deep Learning","Multiple-View","Dashboard","Mixed-Initiative","Visualization Provenance"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Deep Learning","Deep Learning Models","User Study","Data Perspective","Combination Of Columns","Machine Learning","Machine-learning","Training Dataset","Training Data Set","Data Visualization","Machine Learning Methods","Machine Learning Method","Machine Learning Models","User Experience","Long Short-term Memory","Long Short Term Memory","LSTM","Data Transformation","Continued Research","Continuous Research","Pie Chart","Recommender Systems","Graph Neural Networks","Visual Design","Chart Data","Siamese Network","Siamese Neural Network","Chart Types","Visual Encoding","View Selection","Paired Rank","Recommendations For Strategies","Recommendation Scheme","Model Assessment","Exploratory Data","Shared Representation","Challenging Problem","Interactive System"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114769","title":"Differentiable Direct Volume Rendering","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":22,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Technical University of Munich, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086928571","id":37086928571,"full_name":"Sebastian Weiss","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technical University of Munich, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Technical University of Munich, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37444424000","id":37444424000,"full_name":"Rüdiger Westermann","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technical University of Munich, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present a differentiable volume rendering solution that provides differentiability of all continuous parameters of the volume rendering process. This differentiable renderer is used to steer the parameters towards a setting with an optimal solution of a problem-specific objective function. We have tailored the approach to volume rendering by enforcing a constant memory footprint via analytic inversion of the blending functions. This makes it independent of the number of sampling steps through the volume and facilitates the consideration of small-scale changes. The approach forms the basis for automatic optimizations regarding external parameters of the rendering process and the volumetric density field itself. We demonstrate its use for automatic viewpoint selection using differentiable entropy as objective, and for optimizing a transfer function from rendered images of a given volume. Optimization of per-voxel densities is addressed in two different ways: First, we mimic inverse tomography and optimize a 3D density field from images using an absorption model. This simplification enables comparisons with algebraic reconstruction techniques and state-of-the-art differentiable path tracers. Second, we introduce a novel approach for tomographic reconstruction from images using an emission-absorption model with post-shading via an arbitrary transfer function.","article_number":"9552224","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552224","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552224/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552224/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"562","end_page":"572","citing_paper_count":17,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1161,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Optimization","Image reconstruction","Transfer functions","Solid modeling","Tomography","Image color analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Differentiable rendering","Direct Volume Rendering","Automatic Differentiation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Volume Rendering","Volumetric Rendering","Volume-rendering","Objective Function","Number Of Steps","Transfer Function","Image Reconstruction","Iterative Reconstruction","Tomographic Reconstruction","Differencing","Differentiability","Solution Of The Objective Function","Solution For Each Objective Function","Loss Function","Loss-of-function","Neural Network","Step Size","Step-size","Intermediate Results","Intermediate Outcomes","Mediator Variable","Intermediate Variables","Line Segment","Volume Density","Intensity Density","Non-convex Problem","Chain Rule","Operator Of Order","Reconstruction Performance","Optical Model","Backward Pass","Adjoint Method","Adjoint Methods","Computational Graph","Automatic Differentiation","Algorithmic Differentiation","Dense Reconstruction","Smoke Plume","Screen Space","Image Entropy","Peak Signal-to-noise Ratio","Peak Signal To Noise Ratio","PSNR","Volume Reconstruction","Automatic Optimization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114802","title":"Kori: Interactive Synthesis of Text and Charts in Data Documents","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":23,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085662755","id":37085662755,"full_name":"Shahid Latif","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Boston College, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089206686","id":37089206686,"full_name":"Zheng Zhou","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Boston College, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089208944","id":37089208944,"full_name":"Yoon Kim","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586060300","id":37586060300,"full_name":"Fabian Beck","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Boston College, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085685242","id":37085685242,"full_name":"Nam Wook Kim","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Boston College, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Charts go hand in hand with text to communicate complex data and are widely adopted in news articles, online blogs, and academic papers.

The narrative structure of a data story serves as the backbone that determines its expressiveness, and it can largely influence how audiences perceive the insights. Freytag's Pyramid is a classic narrative structure that has been widely used in film and literature. While there are continuous recommendations and discussions about applying Freytag's Pyramid to data stories, little systematic and practical guidance is available on how to use Freytag's Pyramid for creating structured data stories. To bridge this gap, we examined how existing practices apply Freytag's Pyramid by analyzing stories extracted from 103 data videos. Based on our findings, we proposed a design space of narrative patterns, data flows, and visual communications to provide practical guidance on achieving narrative intents, organizing data facts, and selecting visual design techniques through story creation. We evaluated the proposed design space through a workshop with 25 participants. Results show that our design space provides a clear framework for rapid storyboarding of data stories with Freytag's Pyramid.","article_number":"9552203","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552203","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552203/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552203/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"922","end_page":"932","citing_paper_count":16,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2340,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Videos","Animation","Visual communication","Systematics","Data models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Freytag's Pyramid","Narrative Structure","Narrative Visualization","Data Storytelling","Data Video"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Design Space","Line Plots","Data Stories","Flow Data","Visualization Techniques","Narrative Structure","Visual Content","Visual Design","Visual Communication","Narrative Data","Story Structure","Narrative Patterns","Temperature Changes","Greenhouse Gas","CO2 Emissions","Greenhouse Gas Emissions","Carbon Emissions","Years Of Experience","Number Of Deaths","Time Series Data","Time-series Data","Creative Process","Changes In Data","Diseases In The World","Audience Perceptions","Visual Strategies","End Of The Story","Important Moment","Aha Moments","Aha Experience","Eureka Moment","Neonatal Conditions","Neonatal Status","Comic Strip","Audience Interest","Resolution Stage","Audience Attention"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114851","title":"COVID-view: Diagnosis of COVID-19 using Chest CT","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":27,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086546820","id":37086546820,"full_name":"Shreeraj Jadhav","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089207608","id":37089207608,"full_name":"Gaofeng Deng","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Radiology, Stony Brook University Hospital, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088610241","id":37088610241,"full_name":"Marlene Zawin","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Radiology, Stony Brook University Hospital, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268052800","id":37268052800,"full_name":"Arie E.

However, comprehensive visualization systems focused on supporting the dual visual+DL diagnosis of COVID-19 are non-existent. We present COVID-view, a visualization application specially tailored for radiologists to diagnose COVID-19 from chest CT data. The system incorporates a complete pipeline of automatic lungs segmentation, localization/isolation of lung abnormalities, followed by visualization, visual and DL analysis, and measurement/quantification tools. Our system combines the traditional 2D workflow of radiologists with newer 2D and 3D visualization techniques with DL support for a more comprehensive diagnosis. COVID-view incorporates a novel DL model for classifying the patients into positive/negative COVID-19 cases, which acts as a reading aid for the radiologist using COVID-view and provides the attention heatmap as an explainable DL for the model output. We designed and evaluated COVID-view through suggestions, close feedback and conducting case studies of real-world patient data by expert radiologists who have substantial experience diagnosing chest CT scans for COVID-19, pulmonary embolism, and other forms of lung infections. We present requirements and task analysis for the diagnosis of COVID-19 that motivate our design choices and results in a practical system which is capable of handling real-world patient cases.","article_number":"9552241","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552241","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552241/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552241/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"227","end_page":"237","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2218,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["COVID-19","Lung","Computed tomography","Visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Solid modeling","Lesions"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["visual-deep learning diagnosis","COVID-19","chest CT","volume rendering","MIP","classification model","explainable DL"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["COVID-19","Chest CT","Computed Tomography","Computed Tomography Scan","CT Scan","Deep Learning","Visual System","Pulmonary Embolism","Pulmonary Thromboembolism","Segmentation Model","Threshold Regression","Segmented Regression","Design Choices","Coronavirus Disease 2019 Cases","3D Visualization","Automatic Segmentation","Vision Applications","Abnormal Lung","Chest CT Scan","Lesion Segmentation","Expert Radiologists","2D Visualization","Blood Vessels","Classification Model","2D Views","Interlobular Septal Thickening","Ground-glass Opacities","Multiple Instance Learning","Multiple-instance Learning","Automatic Classification","Adjacent Slices","Color Map","Colour Map","Colormap","Transfer Function","Visualization Tool","Bronchial Tree"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114803","title":"Examining Effort in 1D Uncertainty Communication Using Individual Differences in Working Memory and NASA-TLX","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":28,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of California Merced in Management of Complex Systems, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102380","id":37087102380,"full_name":"Spencer C.

Prior work demonstrates mixed performance outcomes with respect to how individuals make decisions using various visual and textual depictions of uncertainty. Part of the inconsistency across findings may be due to an over-reliance on task accuracy, which cannot, on its own, provide a comprehensive understanding of how uncertainty visualization techniques support reasoning processes. In this work, we advance the debate surrounding the efficacy of modern 1D uncertainty visualizations by conducting converging quantitative and qualitative analyses of both the effort and strategies used by individuals when provided with quantile dotplots, density plots, interval plots, mean plots, and textual descriptions of uncertainty. We utilize two approaches for examining effort across uncertainty communication techniques: a measure of individual differences in working-memory capacity known as an operation span (OSPAN) task and self-reports of perceived workload via the NASA-TLX. The results reveal that both visualization methods and working-memory capacity impact participants' decisions. Specifically, quantile dotplots and density plots (i.e., distributional annotations) result in more accurate judgments than interval plots, textual descriptions of uncertainty, and mean plots (i.e., summary annotations). Additionally, participants' open-ended responses suggest that individuals viewing distributional annotations are more likely to employ a strategy that explicitly incorporates uncertainty into their judgments than those viewing summary annotations. When comparing quantile dotplots to density plots, this work finds that both methods are equally effective for low-working-memory individuals. However, for individuals with high-working-memory capacity, quantile dotplots evoke more accurate responses with less perceived effort. Given these results, we advocate for the inclusion of converging behavioral and subjective workload metrics in addition to accuracy performance to further disambiguate meaningful differences among visualization techniques.","article_number":"9552887","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552887","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552887/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552887/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"411","end_page":"421","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":730,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty","Data visualization","Visualization","Task analysis","Annotations","Measurement uncertainty","Cognition"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty Visualization","Working Memory","Individual Differences","Online OSPAN","Effort","Workload","NASA-TLX"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Individual Differences","NASA Task Load Index","NASA-Task Load Index","Uncertainty Communication","Density Plots","Task Accuracy","Visualization Techniques","Working Memory Capacity","Open-ended Responses","Communication Techniques","Additional Metrics","Mean Plot","Individual Difference Measures","Operation Span","Individual Differences In Capacity","Subjective Workload","Confidence Interval","Variance In The Data","Posterior Probability","Posterior Distribution","Bayesian Model","Bayesian Approach","Bayesian Network","Forecasting","Mental Demands","Mathematical Problem","Math Problems","Bayesian Regression","Bayesian Ridge Regression","Bayesian Linear Regression","Low Working Memory Capacity","Credible Interval","Cognitive Load","Cognitive Demands","Mental Workload","Mental Effort","Deterministic Strategy","Deterministic Scheme","Difference In Accuracy","Visual Design"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114814","title":"An Evaluation-Focused Framework for Visualization Recommendation Algorithms","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":29,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Maryland, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089205296","id":37089205296,"full_name":"Zehua Zeng","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089208176","id":37089208176,"full_name":"Phoebe Moh","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Adobe Research, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085829363","id":37085829363,"full_name":"Fan Du","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Adobe Research, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Adobe Research, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085728980","id":37085728980,"full_name":"Jane Hoffswell","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Adobe Research, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Adobe Research, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089206080","id":37089206080,"full_name":"Tak Yeon Lee","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Adobe Research, United States","KAIST, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Adobe Research, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086060990","id":37086060990,"full_name":"Sana Malik","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Adobe Research, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Adobe Research, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37287201000","id":37287201000,"full_name":"Eunyee Koh","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Adobe Research, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086366223","id":37086366223,"full_name":"Leilani Battle","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland, United States","University of Washington, United States"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Although we have seen a proliferation of algorithms for recommending visualizations, these algorithms are rarely compared with one another, making it difficult to ascertain which algorithm is best for a given visual analysis scenario.

In this paper, we propose an evaluation-focused framework to contextualize and compare a broad range of visualization recommendation algorithms. We present the structure of our framework, where algorithms are specified using three components: (1) a graph representing the full space of possible visualization designs, (2) the method used to traverse the graph for potential candidates for recommendation, and (3) an oracle used to rank candidate designs. To demonstrate how our framework guides the formal comparison of algorithmic performance, we not only theoretically compare five existing representative recommendation algorithms, but also empirically compare four new algorithms generated based on our findings from the theoretical comparison. Our results show that these algorithms behave similarly in terms of user performance, highlighting the need for more rigorous formal comparisons of recommendation algorithms to further clarify their benefits in various analysis scenarios.","article_number":"9552925","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552925","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552925/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552925/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"346","end_page":"356","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":947,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Machine learning algorithms","Approximation algorithms","Task analysis","Encoding","Clustering algorithms"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization Tools","Visualization Recommendation Algorithms"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Recommendation Algorithm","Visualization Recommendation","User Performance","Visual Design","Range Of Algorithms","Usability","Ease Of Use","Bayesian Model","Bayesian Approach","Bayesian Network","Behavioral Model","User Study","Visual Task","Data Transformation","Analysis Tasks","Design Space","Types Of Algorithms","Participants Performed","Recommender Systems","Relational View","Bayesian Regression","Bayesian Ridge Regression","Bayesian Linear Regression","Depth-first","Depth First Search","Depth-first Search","Breadth-first Search","Breadth First Search","Breadth-first","Bayesian Regression Model","Different Types Of Algorithms","Distance Perception","Visual Encoding","Reference Node","Exploration Task","Empirical Evaluation","Completion Time","Confidence Ratings","Pre-defined Criteria","Pre-defined Criterion"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114804","title":"VizLinter: A Linter and Fixer Framework for Data Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":30,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab at Tongji University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085471103","id":37085471103,"full_name":"Qing Chen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab at Tongji University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab at Tongji University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656468","id":37088656468,"full_name":"Fuling Sun","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab at Tongji University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab at Tongji University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087405128","id":37087405128,"full_name":"Xinyue Xu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab at Tongji University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab at Tongji University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089215135","id":37089215135,"full_name":"Zui Chen","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab at Tongji University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Ant Group, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089213983","id":37089213983,"full_name":"Jiazhe Wang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Ant Group, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab at Tongji University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604309600","id":37604309600,"full_name":"Nan Cao","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab at Tongji University, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Despite the rising popularity of automated visualization tools, existing systems tend to provide direct results which do not always fit the input data or meet visualization requirements.

In this paper, we introduce a system, VITALITY, intended to complement existing practices. In particular, VITALITY promotes serendipitous discovery of relevant literature using transformer language models, allowing users to find semantically similar papers in a word embedding space given (1) a list of input paper(s) or (2) a working abstract. VITALITY visualizes this document-level embedding space in an interactive 2-D scatterplot using dimension reduction. VITALITY also summarizes meta information about the document corpus or search query, including keywords and co-authors, and allows users to save and export papers for use in a literature review. We present qualitative findings from an evaluation of VITALITY, suggesting it can be a promising complementary technique for conducting academic literature reviews. Furthermore, we contribute data from 38 popular data visualization publication venues in VITALITY, and we provide scrapers for the open-source community to continue to grow the list of supported venues.","article_number":"9552447","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552447","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552447/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552447/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"486","end_page":"496","citing_paper_count":14,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":924,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Bibliographies","Data visualization","Transformers","Keyword search","Internet","Tools","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["transformers","word embeddings","literature review","web scraper","dataset","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Academic Literature","Scholarly Literature","Academic Publications","Visual Analysis","Literature Review","Interactive","Relevant Literature","Data Visualization","Latent Space","Embedding Space","Semantic Similarity","Semantic Relatedness","Word Embedding","Word Vectors","Review Of Academic Literature","Relevant Results","Relevant Outcomes","Visual System","Quality Of Outcomes","Quality Of Results","Similarity Score","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Cognitive Biases","Cognitive Bias","Vision Research","Relevant Papers","Citation Network","Conducted Literature Review","Usage Scenarios","Citation Counts","Citation Impact","Citation Metrics","Topic Modeling","Title Of The Paper","IEEE Xplore","IEEEXplore","IEEE Explore","ACM Digital Library","PhD Program","Microsoft Teams","MS Teams"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114877","title":"GlyphCreator: Towards Example-based Automatic Generation of Circular Glyphs","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":32,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088769622","id":37088769622,"full_name":"Lu Ying","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543321","id":37086543321,"full_name":"Tan Tang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089206507","id":37089206507,"full_name":"Yuzhe Luo","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655895","id":37088655895,"full_name":"Lvkeshen Shen","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Sport Science, Zhejiang University, Hangrhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086448603","id":37086448603,"full_name":"Xiao Xie","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Sport Science, Zhejiang University, Hangrhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computing, Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593898200","id":37593898200,"full_name":"Lingyun Yu","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computing, Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","id":37407308300,"full_name":"Yingcai Wu","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Circular glyphs are used across disparate fields to represent multidimensional data. However, although these glyphs are extremely effective, creating them is often laborious, even for those with professional design skills. This paper presents GlyphCreator, an interactive tool for the example-based generation of circular glyphs. Given an example circular glyph and multidimensional input data, GlyphCreator promptly generates a list of design candidates, any of which can be edited to satisfy the requirements of a particular representation. To develop GlyphCreator, we first derive a design space of circular glyphs by summarizing relationships between different visual elements. With this design space, we build a circular glyph dataset and develop a deep learning model for glyph parsing. The model can deconstruct a circular glyph bitmap into a series of visual elements. Next, we introduce an interface that helps users bind the input data attributes to visual elements and customize visual styles. We evaluate the parsing model through a quantitative experiment, demonstrate the use of GlyphCreator through two use scenarios, and validate its effectiveness through user interviews.","article_number":"9557223","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9557223","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9557223/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9557223/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"400","end_page":"410","citing_paper_count":14,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":913,"insert_date":"20211001","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Layout","Deep learning","Data mining","Tools","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Glyph-based visualization","machine learning","automatic visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Automatic Generation","Circular Glyphs","Deep Learning","Parsing","Multidimensional Data","Design Space","Visual Elements","Design Skills","User Interviews","Convolutional Neural Network","Data Visualization","Central Point","Object Detection","Detection Model","Bounding Box","Deconstruction","Reference Image","Bar Charts","Intermediate Layer","Pie Chart","Inside Layer","Polar Coordinate System","Usage Scenarios","Lack Of Datasets","Ground-truth Bounding Box","Origin Of The Coordinate System","Total Risk","Numerous Imaging","Optical Character Recognition","Design Process"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114839","title":"Wasserstein Distances, Geodesics and Barycenters of Merge Trees","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":33,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Sorbonne Université and CNRS, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089205699","id":37089205699,"full_name":"Mathieu Pont","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sorbonne Université and CNRS, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Sorbonne Université and CNRS, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102371","id":37087102371,"full_name":"Jules Vidal","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sorbonne Université and CNRS, France"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Paris, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294223900","id":37294223900,"full_name":"Julie Delon","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Paris, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Sorbonne Université and CNRS, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37298870300","id":37298870300,"full_name":"Julien Tierny","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sorbonne Université and CNRS, France"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"This paper presents a unified computational framework for the estimation of distances, geodesics and barycenters of merge trees. We extend recent work on the edit distance [104] and introduce a new metric, called the Wasserstein distance between merge trees, which is purposely designed to enable efficient computations of geodesics and barycenters. Specifically, our new distance is strictly equivalent to the $L$2-Wasserstein distance between extremum persistence diagrams, but it is restricted to a smaller solution space, namely, the space of rooted partial isomorphisms between branch decomposition trees. This enables a simple extension of existing optimization frameworks [110] for geodesics and barycenters from persistence diagrams to merge trees. We introduce a task-based algorithm which can be generically applied to distance, geodesic, barycenter or cluster computation. The task-based nature of our approach enables further accelerations with shared-memory parallelism. Extensive experiments on public ensembles and SciVis contest benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency of our approach - with barycenter computations in the orders of minutes for the largest examples - as well as its qualitative ability to generate representative barycenter merge trees, visually summarizing the features of interest found in the ensemble. We show the utility of our contributions with dedicated visualization applications: feature tracking, temporal reduction and ensemble clustering. We provide a lightweight C++ implementation that can be used to reproduce our results.","article_number":"9555911","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555911","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9555911/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9555911/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"291","end_page":"301","citing_paper_count":14,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":560,"insert_date":"20211001","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Measurement","Task analysis","Probability density function","Uncertainty","Market research","Data models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Topological data analysis","merge trees","scalar data","ensemble data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Geodesic","Merging Algorithm","Merge Tree","Interesting Feature","Interesting Characteristics","Isomorphism","Distance Calculation","Distance Computation","Edit Distance","Feature Tracking","Feature-tracking","Joining Tree","Junction Tree","Tree-decomposition","Tree Decomposition","Temporary Reduction","Barycenter","Ensemble Clustering","Characteristics Of Data","Features Of Data","Critical Point","Computational Approaches","Parallelization","Parallel Computing","Efficient Algorithm","Search Space","Linear Interpolation","Sublevel Set","Superlevel Sets","Assignment Problem","Topological Data Analysis","Subtree","Input Tree","Distance Metrics","Ensemble Members","Distinct Trends","Main Trends"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114793","title":"Towards Visual Explainable Active Learning for Zero-Shot Classification","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":34,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102818","id":37087102818,"full_name":"Shichao Jia","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089090068","id":37089090068,"full_name":"Zeyu Li","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089205711","id":37089205711,"full_name":"Nuo Chen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37281468400","id":37281468400,"full_name":"Jiawan Zhang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, China","Tianjin cultural heritage conservation and inheritance engineering technology center and Key Research Center for Surface Monitoring and Analysis of Relics, State Administration of Cultural Heritage, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Zero-shot classification is a promising paradigm to solve an applicable problem when the training classes and test classes are disjoint. Achieving this usually needs experts to externalize their domain knowledge by manually specifying a class-attribute matrix to define which classes have which attributes. Designing a suitable class-attribute matrix is the key to the subsequent procedure, but this design process is tedious and trial-and-error with no guidance. This paper proposes a visual explainable active learning approach with its design and implementation called semantic navigator to solve the above problems. This approach promotes human-AI teaming with four actions (ask, explain, recommend, respond) in each interaction loop. The machine asks contrastive questions to guide humans in the thinking process of attributes. A novel visualization called semantic map explains the current status of the machine. Therefore analysts can better understand why the machine misclassifies objects. Moreover, the machine recommends the labels of classes for each attribute to ease the labeling burden. Finally, humans can steer the model by modifying the labels interactively, and the machine adjusts its recommendations. The visual explainable active learning approach improves humans' efficiency of building zero-shot classification models interactively, compared with the method without guidance. We justify our results with user studies using the standard benchmarks for zero-shot classification.","article_number":"9552842","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552842","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552842/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552842/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"791","end_page":"801","citing_paper_count":13,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1591,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Semantics","Labeling","Training","Visual analytics","Testing","Task analysis","Navigation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Active Learning","Explainable Artificial Intelligence","Human-AI Teaming","Mixed-Initiative Visual Analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Active Learning","Learning Classifiers","Visual Learning","Zero-shot Classification","Design Process","User Study","Class Labels","Classifier Training","Visual Approach","Semantic Map","Semantic Function","Training Data","Support Vector Machine","Deep Neural Network","Feature Space","Test Accuracy","Visual Analysis","Shared Space","Visual Properties","Visual Attributes","Line Chart","Semantic Space","Unseen Classes","Class Prototypes","Case-based Reasoning","Case Based Reasoning","Polar Bears","Ursus Maritimus","Humpback Whales","Megaptera Novaeangliae","Unlabeled Instances","Semantic Gap","Grizzly Bears","Conducted Case Studies","Maximum Margin"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114780","title":"Context Matters: A Theory of Semantic Discriminability for Perceptual Encoding Systems","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":35,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Psychology and Wisconsin Institute for Discovery University of Wisconsin_Madison, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089208115","id":37089208115,"full_name":"Kushin Mukherjee","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Psychology and Wisconsin Institute for Discovery University of Wisconsin_Madison, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Cognitive Science University of California, Berkeley","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089205120","id":37089205120,"full_name":"Brian Yin","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Cognitive Science University of California, Berkeley"]}},{"affiliation":"Neurobiology and Wisconsin Institute for Discovery University of Wisconsin-Madison, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089207444","id":37089207444,"full_name":"Brianne E.

Previous work has suggested such effects are limited to concepts that have strong, specific associations with colors. However, although a concept may not be strongly associated with any colors, its mapping can be disambiguated in the context of other concepts in an encoding system. We articulate this view in semantic discriminability theory, a general framework for understanding conditions determining when people can infer meaning from perceptual features. Semantic discriminability is the degree to which observers can infer a unique mapping between visual features and concepts. Semantic discriminability theory posits that the capacity for semantic discriminability for a set of concepts is constrained by the difference between the feature-concept association distributions across the concepts in the set. We define formal properties of this theory and test its implications in two experiments. The results show that the capacity to produce semantically discriminable colors for sets of concepts was indeed constrained by the statistical distance between color-concept association distributions (Experiment 1). Moreover, people could interpret meanings of colors in bar graphs insofar as the colors were semantically discriminable, even for concepts previously considered “non-colorable” (Experiment 2). The results suggest that colors are more robust for visual communication than previously thought.","article_number":"9552216","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552216","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552216/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552216/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"697","end_page":"706","citing_paper_count":13,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":544,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Color","Semantics","Visualization","Image color analysis","Encoding","Plastics","Visual communication"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual Reasoning","Information Visualization","Visual Communication","Visual Encoding","Color Cognition"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Semantic Discrimination","Strongly Associated","Visual Information","Set Of Concepts","Visual Communication","Statistical Distance","Association Of People","Semantic Theory","Pairing","Low Capacity","Strength Of Association","Low Specificity","Color Space","Colour Space","Color Components","Feature Subset","Part Of Space","Ability Of People","Assignment Problem","Proportion Of Trials","Entropy Of Distribution","Individual Concepts","Semantic Distance","Color Correction","Correct Colour","Color Palette","Colour Palette","Notion Of Distance","Top Of The Screen","Catch Trials","Top Associations","Optimal Assignment","Color Vision","Colour Vision","Color Perception","Proportion Of Time"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114810","title":"THALIS: Human-Machine Analysis of Longitudinal Symptoms in Cancer Therapy","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":36,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Illinois, Chicago, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089183519","id":37089183519,"full_name":"Carla Floricel","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Illinois, Chicago, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Illinois, Chicago, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089184524","id":37089184524,"full_name":"Nafiul Nipu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Illinois, Chicago, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Iowa, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089207262","id":37089207262,"full_name":"Mikayla Biggs","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Iowa, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Illinois, Chicago, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100729","id":37087100729,"full_name":"Andrew Wentzel","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Illinois, Chicago, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Iowa, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37936571200","id":37936571200,"full_name":"Guadalupe Canahuate","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Iowa, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088662074","id":37088662074,"full_name":"Lisanne Van Dijk","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086696885","id":37086696885,"full_name":"Abdallah Mohamed","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085431902","id":37085431902,"full_name":"C.David Fuller","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Illinois, Chicago, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37937697100","id":37937697100,"full_name":"G.Elisabeta Marai","author_order":9,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Illinois, Chicago, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Although cancer patients survive years after oncologic therapy, they are plagued with long-lasting or permanent residual symptoms, whose severity, rate of development, and resolution after treatment vary largely between survivors.

We describe THALIS, an environment for visual analysis and knowledge discovery from cancer therapy symptom data, developed in close collaboration with oncology experts. Our approach leverages unsupervised machine learning methodology over cohorts of patients, and, in conjunction with custom visual encodings and interactions, provides context for new patients based on patients with similar diagnostic features and symptom evolution. We evaluate this approach on data collected from a cohort of head and neck cancer patients.

An existing ranking of these visual channels is based on how accurately participants could report the ratio between two depicted values. There is an assumption that this ranking should hold for different tasks and for different numbers of marks. However, there is surprisingly little existing work that tests this assumption, especially given that visually computing ratios is relatively unimportant in real-world visualizations, compared to seeing, remembering, and comparing trends and motifs, across displays that almost universally depict more than two values. To simulate the information extracted from a glance at a visualization, we instead asked participants to immediately reproduce a set of values from memory after they were shown the visualization. These values could be shown in a bar graph (position (bar)), line graph (position (line)), heat map (luminance), bubble chart (area), misaligned bar graph (length), or ‘wind map’ (angle). With a Bayesian multilevel modeling approach, we show how the rank positions of visual channels shift across different numbers of marks (2, 4 or 8) and for bias, precision, and error measures. The ranking did not hold, even for reproductions of only 2 marks, and the new probabilistic ranking was highly inconsistent for reproductions of different numbers of marks. Other factors besides channel choice had an order of magnitude more influence on performance, such as the number of values in the series (e.g., more marks led to larger errors), or the value of each mark (e.g., small values were systematically overestimated). Every visual channel was worse for displays with 8 marks than 4, consistent with established limits on visual memory. These results point to the need for a body of empirical studies that move beyond two-value ratio judgments as a baseline for reliably ranking the quality of a visual channel, including testing new tasks (detection of trends or motifs), timescales (immediate computation, or later comparison), and the number of values (from a handful, to thousands).","article_number":"9557878","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9557878","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9557878/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9557878/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"707","end_page":"717","citing_paper_count":13,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":929,"insert_date":"20211004","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Task analysis","Visualization","Bars","Data visualization","Memory management","Measurement uncertainty","Correlation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["DataType Agnostic","Human-Subjects Quantitative Studies","Perception & Cognition","Charts","Diagrams","and Plots"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Channels","Small Values","Bayesian Inference","Bayesian Methods","Bayesian Analysis","Bayesian Method","Bayesian Model","Bayesian Approach","Bayesian Network","Number Of Values","Number Of Markers","Visual Memory","Bubble Chart","Channel Choice","Large Values","Task Performance","Posterior Probability","Posterior Distribution","Data Visualization","Eye Movements","Working Memory","Visual Task","Bar Charts","Consistent Response","Smaller Error","Effects Of Fatigue","Reproduction Task","Comparison Task","Line Chart","Widely Applicable Information Criterion","Watanabe-Akaike Information Criterion","Reproductive Performance","Memory Bias","Memory Biases","Neighborhood Effects","Neighbor Effects","Neighbourhood Effects","Raw Responses","Global Shape","Set Of Responses"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114844","title":"Perception!

Researchers and practitioners often tout visualizations' ability to “make the invisible visible” and to “enhance cognitive abilities.” Meanwhile superhero comics and other modern fiction often depict characters with similarly fantastic abilities that allow them to see and interpret the world in ways that transcend traditional human perception. We investigate the intersection of these domains, and show how the language of superpowers can be used to characterize existing visualization systems and suggest opportunities for new and empowering ones.

Fast order processing at the warehouses ensures timely deliveries and improves customer satisfaction. However, monitoring, analyzing, and manipulating order processing in the warehouses in real time are challenging for traditional methods due to the sheer volume of incoming orders, the fuzzy definition of delayed order patterns, and the complex decision-making of order handling priorities. In this paper, we adopt a data-driven approach and propose OrderMonitor, a visual analytics system that assists warehouse managers in analyzing and improving order processing efficiency in real time based on streaming warehouse event data. Specifically, the order processing pipeline is visualized with a novel pipeline design based on the sedimentation metaphor to facilitate real-time order monitoring and suggest potentially abnormal orders. We also design a novel visualization that depicts order timelines based on the Gantt charts and Marey's graphs. Such a visualization helps the managers gain insights into the performance of order processing and find major blockers for delayed orders. Furthermore, an evaluating view is provided to assist users in inspecting order details and assigning priorities to improve the processing performance. The effectiveness of OrderMonitor is evaluated with two case studies on a real-world warehouse dataset.","article_number":"9557224","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9557224","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9557224/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9557224/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"857","end_page":"867","citing_paper_count":12,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2070,"insert_date":"20211001","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Monitoring","Real-time systems","Schedules","Delays","Warehousing","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Streaming data","time-series data","e-commerce warehouse","order processing"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Process In Order","Visual Approach","E-commerce Warehouses","Sediment","Visual System","Visual Analysis","Processing Pipeline","Real-world Datasets","Real-world Data Sets","Warehouse Management","Processing Time","Hierarchical Structure","Hierarchical Organization","Real-time Performance","Real-time Processing","Real-time Operation","Visual Methods","Visual Method","Data Streams","Kinds Of Data","Domain Experts","Historical Processes","Management Experience","Historical Record","Delay Issues","Visual Design","Visualization Techniques","Assembly Line","Expert Interviews","Radio Frequency Identification","RFID","Temporal Processing","Visual Metaphors","Detection Rules","Smart Manufacturing","Smart Factory"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114823","title":"Visual Arrangements of Bar Charts Influence Comparisons in Viewer Takeaways","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":40,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"UMass Amherst, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102197","id":37087102197,"full_name":"Cindy Xiong","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UMass Amherst, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Tableau Research, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37392286200","id":37392286200,"full_name":"Vidya Setlur","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tableau Research, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085687578","id":37085687578,"full_name":"Benjamin Bach","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom"]}},{"affiliation":"Adobe Research, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37287201000","id":37287201000,"full_name":"Eunyee Koh","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Adobe Research, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089208835","id":37089208835,"full_name":"Kylie Lin","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077249100","id":37077249100,"full_name":"Steven Franconeri","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University, United States"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Well-designed data visualizations can lead to more powerful and intuitive processing by a viewer. To help a viewer intuitively compare values to quickly generate key takeaways, visualization designers can manipulate how data values are arranged in a chart to afford particular comparisons. Using simple bar charts as a case study, we empirically tested the comparison affordances of four common arrangements: vertically juxtaposed, horizontally juxtaposed, overlaid, and stacked. We asked participants to type out what patterns they perceived in a chart and we coded their takeaways into types of comparisons. In a second study, we asked data visualization design experts to predict which arrangement they would use to afford each type of comparison and found both alignments and mismatches with our findings. These results provide concrete guidelines for how both human designers and automatic chart recommendation systems can make visualizations that help viewers extract the “right” takeaway.","article_number":"9552208","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552208","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552208/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552208/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"955","end_page":"965","citing_paper_count":11,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1116,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Bars","Data visualization","Visualization","Tools","Semantics","Affordances","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Comparison","perception","visual grouping","bar charts","recommendation systems","natural language interaction"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Bar Charts","Visual Arrangement","Data Visualization","Affordances","Comparison Of Types","Recommender Systems","Visual Design","Intuitive Processes","Common Arrangement","Natural Language","Comparable Accuracy","Accurate Comparison","Future Researchers","Crowdsourcing","Bar Graphs","Spatial Arrangement","Visual Comparison","Spatial Proximity","Group Elements","Line Graph","End Of The Survey","Partial Comparisons","Usage Intention","Visual Analytics Tool","Computational Linguistics","Total Sales","Chart Types","Descriptive Sentences","Syntactic Ambiguity","Structural Ambiguity","Syntactically Ambiguous","Ambiguous Structures","Type C1","Comparison Task"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114853","title":"Geo-Context Aware Study of Vision-Based Autonomous Driving Models and Spatial Video Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":41,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Kent State University, OH, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085681542","id":37085681542,"full_name":"Suphanut Jamonnak","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Kent State University, OH, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Kent State University, OH, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37277701200","id":37277701200,"full_name":"Ye Zhao","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Kent State University, OH, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Kent State University, OH, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655389","id":37088655389,"full_name":"Xinyi Huang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Kent State University, OH, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"West Chester University, PA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088349086","id":37088349086,"full_name":"Md Amiruzzaman","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["West Chester University, PA, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Vision-based deep learning (DL) methods have made great progress in learning autonomous driving models from large-scale crowd-sourced video datasets.

In this work, we investigate one specific design factor, animation, and present Kineticharts, an animation design scheme for creating charts that express five positive affects: joy, amusement, surprise, tenderness, and excitement. These five affects were found to be frequently communicated through animation in data stories. Regarding each affect, we designed varied kinetic motions represented by bar charts, line charts, and pie charts, resulting in 60 animated charts for the five affects. We designed Kineticharts by first conducting a need-finding study with professional practitioners from data journalism and then analyzing a corpus of affective motion graphics to identify salient kinetic patterns. We evaluated Kineticharts through two user studies. The results suggest that Kineticharts can accurately convey affects, and improve the expressiveness of data stories, as well as enhance user engagement without hindering data comprehension compared to the animation design from DataClips, an authoring tool for data videos.","article_number":"9552240","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552240","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552240/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552240/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"933","end_page":"943","citing_paper_count":11,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1276,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Animation","Data visualization","Videos","Visualization","Interviews","Mood","Journalism"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Animation","Storytelling","Affective Design"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Stories","User Study","Positive Affect","Bar Charts","Amusement","Design Factors","Pie Chart","Data Journalism","Diary Data","Data-driven Journalism","Line Chart","Affective Feelings","Kinetic Patterns","Professional Practitioners","Audience","Null Hypothesis","Negative Emotions","Negative Affect","Domain Experts","Side View","Experience Design","Social Progress","Visual Design","Inspiration For The Design","Visual Channels","Message Delivery","Camera Movement"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114781","title":"VideoModerator: A Risk-aware Framework for Multimodal Video Moderation in E-Commerce","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":43,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University and Zhejiang Lab, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543321","id":37086543321,"full_name":"Tan Tang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University and Zhejiang Lab, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University and Zhejiang Lab, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085523487","id":37085523487,"full_name":"Yanhong Wu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University and Zhejiang Lab, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University and Zhejiang Lab, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","id":37407308300,"full_name":"Yingcai Wu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University and Zhejiang Lab, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computing, Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593898200","id":37593898200,"full_name":"Lingyun Yu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computing, Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Alibaba Group, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086863152","id":37086863152,"full_name":"Yuhong Li","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Alibaba Group, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Video moderation, which refers to remove deviant or explicit content from e-commerce livestreams, has become prevalent owing to social and engaging features.

Regardless of how effective a visualization is, providing equal access for blind users requires a paradigm shift for the visualization research community. To enact such a shift, it is not sufficient to treat visualization accessibility as merely another technical problem to overcome. Instead, supporting the millions of blind and visually impaired users around the world who have equally valid needs for data analysis as sighted individuals requires a respectful, equitable, and holistic approach that includes all users from the onset. In this paper, we draw on accessibility research methodologies to make inroads towards such an approach. We first identify the people who have specific insight into how blind people perceive the world: orientation and mobility (O&M) experts, who are instructors that teach blind individuals how to navigate the physical world using non-visual senses. We interview 10 O&M experts—all of them blind—to understand how best to use sensory substitution other than the visual sense for conveying spatial layouts. Finally, we investigate our qualitative findings using thematic analysis. While blind people in general tend to use both sound and touch to understand their surroundings, we focused on auditory affordances and how they can be used to make data visualizations accessible—using sonification and auralization. However, our experts recommended supporting a combination of senses—sound and touch—to make charts accessible as blind individuals may be more familiar with exploring tactile charts. We report results on both sound and touch affordances, and conclude by discussing implications for accessible visualization for blind individuals.","article_number":"9552177","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552177","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552177/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552177/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"1084","end_page":"1094","citing_paper_count":11,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":987,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Interviews","Blindness","Training","Navigation","Layout"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Accessibility","blind users","sonification","visualization","spatial layouts","sound perception"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Sensory Substitution","Ultrasonic","Sonication","Navigation","Visual Impairment","Vision Loss","Data Visualization","Vision Research","Spatial Layout","Blind Individuals","Support Data Analysis","Learning Experiences","Visual Analysis","Hearing Impairment","Hearing-impaired","3D Space","3-dimensional Space","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Virtual World","Virtual Space","Online World","Bar Charts","Pie Chart","Sound Source","Visual Space","Mental Maps","Indoor Navigation","Indoor Navigation System","Geometric Concepts","Sound Localization","Binaural Hearing","Spatial Hearing","Sound Source Localization","Spatial Concepts","Acoustic Shadowing","Soundscape","Line Chart","Non-speech Sounds","Radar Chart","Radar Graph"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114870","title":"Attribute-based Explanation of Non-Linear Embeddings of High-Dimensional Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":45,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Visual Information Analysis group at TU Kaiserslautern, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089207818","id":37089207818,"full_name":"Jan-Tobias Sohns","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Information Analysis group at TU Kaiserslautern, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Visual Information Analysis group at TU Kaiserslautern, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089208259","id":37089208259,"full_name":"Michaela Schmitt","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Information Analysis group at TU Kaiserslautern, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Laboratory of Engineering Thermodynamics (LTD) at TU Kaiserslautern, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089206120","id":37089206120,"full_name":"Fabian Jirasek","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Laboratory of Engineering Thermodynamics (LTD) at TU Kaiserslautern, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Laboratory of Engineering Thermodynamics (LTD) at TU Kaiserslautern, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38230032600","id":38230032600,"full_name":"Hans Hasse","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Laboratory of Engineering Thermodynamics (LTD) at TU Kaiserslautern, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Visual Information Analysis group at TU Kaiserslautern, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38488927600","id":38488927600,"full_name":"Heike Leitte","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Information Analysis group at TU Kaiserslautern, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Embeddings of high-dimensional data are widely used to explore data, to verify analysis results, and to communicate information.

We present the Non-Linear Embeddings Surveyor (NoLiES) that combines a novel augmentation strategy for projected data (rangesets) with interactive analysis in a small multiples setting. Rangesets use a set-based visualization approach for binned attribute values that enable the user to quickly observe structure and detect outliers. We detail the link between algebraic topology and rangesets and demonstrate the utility of NoLiES in case studies with various challenges (complex attribute value distribution, many attributes, many data points) and a real-world application to understand latent features of matrix completion in thermodynamics.","article_number":"9552929","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552929","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552929/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552929/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"540","end_page":"550","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":837,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Task analysis","Data analysis","Topology","Image color analysis","Dimensionality reduction"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Dimensionality reduction","embedding","augmented projections","point set contours","explainable artificial intelligence"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Embedding","Nonlinear Embedding","Embedding Of High-dimensional Data","Embedding Of High Dimensional Data","Color Code","Colour Code","Color-coding","Latent Features","Latent Characteristics","Matrix Completion","Linear Projection","Attribute Values","Nonlinear Projection","Algebraic Topology","Histogram","Dimensionality Reduction","Variety Of Techniques","Interactive System","Point Cloud","Point Clouds","Automatic Detection","Color Map","Colour Map","Colormap","Convex Hull","Edge Length","Edge Lengths","Topological Analysis","Jupyter Notebook","Points In Plane","Higher Life Satisfaction","Delaunay Triangulation","Suitable Description","Geometric Approach","Simplicial Complex","Nonlinear Techniques","Linear Techniques","Activity Coefficient"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114756","title":"STRATISFIMAL LAYOUT: A modular optimization model for laying out layered node-link network visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":46,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088659466","id":37088659466,"full_name":"Sara di Bartolomeo","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37270012700","id":37270012700,"full_name":"Mirek Riedewald","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38281738300","id":38281738300,"full_name":"Wolfgang Gatterbauer","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38350716800","id":38350716800,"full_name":"Cody Dunne","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Node-link visualizations are a familiar and powerful tool for displaying the relationships in a network. The readability of these visualizations highly depends on the spatial layout used for the nodes. In this paper, we focus on computing layered layouts, in which nodes are aligned on a set of parallel axes to better expose hierarchical or sequential relationships. Heuristic-based layouts are widely used as they scale well to larger networks and usually create readable, albeit sub-optimal, visualizations. We instead use a layout optimization model that prioritizes optimality - as compared to scalability - because an optimal solution not only represents the best attainable result, but can also serve as a baseline to evaluate the effectiveness of layout heuristics. We take an important step towards powerful and flexible network visualization by proposing Stratisfimal Layout, a modular integer-linear-programming formulation that can consider several important readability criteria simultaneously — crossing reduction, edge bendiness, and nested and multi-layer groups. The layout can be adapted to diverse use cases through its modularity. Individual features can be enabled and customized depending on the application. We provide open-source and documented implementations of the layout, both for web-based and desktop visualizations. As a proof-of-concept, we apply it to the problem of visualizing complicated SQL queries, which have features that we believe cannot be addressed by existing layout optimization models. We also include a benchmark network generator and the results of an empirical evaluation to assess the performance trade-offs of our design choices.

This paper presents (1) a narrative summarization algorithm to reduce the size and complexity of cyber security narratives with a user-customizable summarization level, and (2) a narrative visualization tailored for incident reports and network logs. An evaluation on real incident reports shows that the summarization algorithm reduces false positives and improves average precision by 41% while reducing average incident report size up to 79%. Together, the visualization and summarization algorithm generate compact representations of cyber narratives that earned praise from a SOC analyst. We further demonstrate that the summarization algorithm can apply to other types of dynamic graphs by automatically generating a summary of the Les Misérables character interaction graph.

They are a testbed for learning high-level reasoning with a primary use in HCI, for instance assistance for the visually impaired. Recent research has shown that state-of-the-art models tend to produce answers exploiting biases and shortcuts in the training data, and sometimes do not even look at the input image, instead of performing the required reasoning steps. We present VisQA, a visual analytics tool that explores this question of reasoning vs. bias exploitation. It exposes the key element of state-of-the-art neural models — attention maps in transformers. Our working hypothesis is that reasoning steps leading to model predictions are observable from attention distributions, which are particularly useful for visualization. The design process of VisQA was motivated by well-known bias examples from the fields of deep learning and vision-language reasoning and evaluated in two ways. First, as a result of a collaboration of three fields, machine learning, vision and language reasoning, and data analytics, the work lead to a better understanding of bias exploitation of neural models for VQA, which eventually resulted in an impact on its design and training through the proposition of a method for the transfer of reasoning patterns from an oracle model. Second, we also report on the design of VisQA, and a goal-oriented evaluation of VisQA targeting the analysis of a model decision process from multiple experts, providing evidence that it makes the inner workings of models accessible to users.","article_number":"9552236","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552236","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552236/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552236/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"976","end_page":"986","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":660,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Cognition","Transformers","Analytical models","Task analysis","Magnetic heads","Head","Biological system modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Transformers","Visual Question Answering","Visual analytics"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114821","title":"MiningVis: Visual Analytics of the Bitcoin Mining Economy","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":49,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"IRT SystemX, Palaiseau, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088866891","id":37088866891,"full_name":"Natkamon Tovanich","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IRT SystemX, Palaiseau, France","Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LISN, Orsay, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Université Paris-Saclay, Univ Evry, IMT-BS, LITEM, Evry-Courcouronnes, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088868714","id":37088868714,"full_name":"Nicolas Soulié","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Université Paris-Saclay, Univ Evry, IMT-BS, LITEM, Evry-Courcouronnes, France"]}},{"affiliation":"IRT SystemX, Palaiseau, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085432351","id":37085432351,"full_name":"Nicolas Heulot","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IRT SystemX, Palaiseau, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LISN, Orsay, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591317800","id":37591317800,"full_name":"Petra Isenberg","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LISN, Orsay, France"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present a visual analytics tool, MiningVis, to explore the long-term historical evolution and dynamics of the Bitcoin mining ecosystem.

Outputs of graph mining models typically provide a ranked list sorted by each item's relevance or utility. However, recent research has identified issues of algorithmic bias in such models, and new graph mining algorithms have been proposed to correct for bias. As such, algorithm developers need tools that can help them uncover potential biases in their models while also exploring the impacts of correcting for biases when employing fairness-aware algorithms. In this paper, we present FairRankVis, a visual analytics framework designed to enable the exploration of multi-class bias in graph mining algorithms. We support both group and individual fairness levels of comparison. Our framework is designed to enable model developers to compare multi-class fairness between algorithms (for example, comparing PageRank with a debiased PageRank algorithm) to assess the impacts of algorithmic debiasing with respect to group and individual fairness.

However, despite the potential for knowledge sharing between these communities, we have little understanding of the ways in which practitioners design in real-world, professional settings. Inquiry in numerous design disciplines indicates that practitioners approach complex situations in ways that are fundamentally different from those of researchers. In this work, I take a practice-led approach to understanding visualization design practice on its own terms. Twenty data visualization practitioners were interviewed and asked about their design process, including the steps they take, how they make decisions, and the methods they use. Findings suggest that practitioners do not follow highly systematic processes, but instead rely on situated forms of knowing and acting in which they draw from precedent and use methods and principles that are determined appropriate in the moment. These findings have implications for how visualization researchers understand and engage with practitioners, and how educators approach the training of future data visualization designers.","article_number":"9555646","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555646","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9555646/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9555646/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"665","end_page":"675","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2496,"insert_date":"20211001","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Human computer interaction","Design methodology","Visualization","Production","Complexity theory","Scholarships"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Design practice","data visualization","design methods","design process","research-practice relationships"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Visualization","Practical Design","Visual Design","Data Visualization Design","Research Community","Design Process","Research Practice","Precedent","Professional Practice","Vision Research","Understanding Of The Ways","Situations In Ways","Design Disciplines","Design Practitioners","Rational Design","Design Principles","Design Method","Design Methods","Cognitive Load","Cognitive Demands","Mental Workload","Mental Effort","Forms Of Knowledge","Knowledge Information","Knowledge Production","Mental Models","Higher Level Of Theory","Heuristic Evaluation","Design Work","Chart Types","Design Professionals","Gestalt Principles","Gestalt Perception","Gestalt Theory","Gestalt Psychology","Design Knowledge","Design Cognition","Community Of Practitioners","Visual Channels","Visual Metaphors"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114828","title":"Propagating Visual Designs to Numerous Plots and Dashboards","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":53,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Oxford, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089207753","id":37089207753,"full_name":"Saiful Khan","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Oxford, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Redsift Ltd., UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490354300","id":38490354300,"full_name":"Phong H.

Examples include control-flow graphs in programs and semantic scene graphs in images. Identifying subgraph patterns in graphs is an important approach to understand their structural properties. We propose a visual analytics system GraphQ to support human-in-the-loop, example-based, subgraph pattern search in a database containing many individual graphs. To support fast, interactive queries, we use graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode a graph as fixed-length latent vector representation, and perform subgraph matching in the latent space. Due to the complexity of the problem, it is still difficult to obtain accurate one-to-one node correspondences in the matching results that are crucial for visualization and interpretation. We, therefore, propose a novel GNN for node-alignment called NeuroAlign, to facilitate easy validation and interpretation of the query results. GraphQ provides a visual query interface with a query editor and a multi-scale visualization of the results, as well as a user feedback mechanism for refining the results with additional constraints. We demonstrate GraphQ through two example usage scenarios: analyzing reusable subroutines in program workflows and semantic scene graph search in images. Quantitative experiments show that NeuroAlign achieves 19%-29% improvement in node-alignment accuracy compared to baseline GNN and provides up to 100× speedup compared to combinatorial algorithms. Our qualitative study with domain experts confirms the effectiveness for both usage scenarios.","article_number":"9552902","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552902","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552902/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552902/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"335","end_page":"345","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1249,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Task analysis","Semantics","Visual analytics","Graph neural networks","Computational modeling","Visual databases","Pattern matching"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Graph","Graph Neural Network","Representation Learning","Visual Query Interface"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Representation Learning","Graph Data","Database Search","Domain Experts","Combination Of Algorithms","Matching Results","Match Outcome","Graph Neural Networks","Query Results","Usage Scenarios","Wide Range Of Domains","Visual Interface","Fixed-length Vector","Fixed Length Vector","Individual Graphs","Scene Graph","Graph Pattern","Semantic Graph","Control Flow Graph","Computer Vision","Directed Graph","Directed Edge","Nodes In The Graph","Approximate Matching","Graph Matching","Graph Database","Decision Problem","Decision Procedure","Node Attributes","Nodal Properties","Small Neighborhood","Small Neighbourhood","Small Neighborhoods","Target Node","Visibility Graph","Visual Question Answering","Categorical Attributes","Classification Properties","Attribute Classification"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114760","title":"From Jam Session to Recital: Synchronous Communication and Collaboration Around Data in Organizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":56,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Tableau Research, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37719161300","id":37719161300,"full_name":"Matthew Brehmer","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tableau Research, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Tableau Research, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282563400","id":37282563400,"full_name":"Robert Kosara","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tableau Research, United States"]}}]},"access_type":"CCBY - IEEE is not the copyright holder of this material.

The visualization research community knows comparatively little about synchronous and multimodal communication around data within organizations, from team meetings to executive briefings. We conducted two qualitative interview studies with individuals who prepare and deliver presentations about data to audiences in organizations. In contrast to prior work, we did not limit our interviews to those who self-identify as data analysts or data scientists. Both studies examined aspects of speaking about data with visual aids such as charts, dashboards, and tables. One study was a retrospective examination of current practices and difficulties, from which we identified three scenarios involving presentations of data. We describe these scenarios using an analogy to musical performance: small collaborative team meetings are akin to jam session, while more structured presentations can range from semi-improvisational performances among peers to formal recitals given to executives or customers. In our second study, we grounded the discussion around three design probes, each examining a different aspect of presenting data: the progressive reveal of visualization to direct attention and advance a narrative, visualization presentation controls that are hidden from the audience's view, and the coordination of a presenter's video with interactive visualization. Our distillation of interviewees' responses surfaced twelve themes, from ways of authoring presentations to creating accessible and engaging audience experiences.","article_number":"9552192","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552192","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552192/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552192/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"1139","end_page":"1149","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":951,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Collaboration","Tools","Interviews","Organizations","Probes","Visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Interviews","design probes","presentation","communication","collaboration","business intelligence","qualitative research"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Synchronous Communication","Jam Sessions","Present Data","Interactive Visualization","Multimodal Communication","Audience Experience","Analysis Of Responses","Video Recordings","Visualization Tool","Analysis Of Interviews","Bar Charts","Present Form","Data In Way","Subject Matter Experts","Monologue","Learning Management System","Present Scenario","Data Journalism","Diary Data","Data-driven Journalism","Software Companies","Video Editing","Retrospective Interviews","Use Of Charts","Aspects Of Presentation","Chart Types","Onboarding","Live Audience","Organizational Settings","Gestures","Retrospective Study","Retrospective Cohort Study","Research Opportunities"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114800","title":"Real-Time Visual Analysis of High-Volume Social Media Posts","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":57,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087498883","id":37087498883,"full_name":"Johannes Knittel","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593029700","id":37593029700,"full_name":"Steffen Koch","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543321","id":37086543321,"full_name":"Tan Tang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37291847800","id":37291847800,"full_name":"Wei Chen","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","id":37407308300,"full_name":"Yingcai Wu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Tsinghua University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406039100","id":37406039100,"full_name":"Shixia Liu","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tsinghua University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268023800","id":37268023800,"full_name":"Thomas Ertl","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Breaking news and first-hand reports often trend on social media platforms before traditional news outlets cover them.

In this work, we present an interactive system that enables the visual analysis of streaming social media data on a large scale in real-time. We propose an efficient and explainable dynamic clustering algorithm that powers a continuously updated visualization of the current thematic landscape as well as detailed visual summaries of specific topics of interest. Our parallel clustering strategy provides an adaptive stream with a digestible but diverse selection of recent posts related to relevant topics. We also integrate familiar visual metaphors that are highly interlinked for enabling both explorative and more focused monitoring tasks. Analysts can gradually increase the resolution to dive deeper into particular topics. In contrast to previous work, our system also works with non-geolocated posts and avoids extensive preprocessing such as detecting events. We evaluated our dynamic clustering algorithm and discuss several use cases that show the utility of our system.","article_number":"9552886","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552886","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552886/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552886/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"879","end_page":"889","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1454,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Social networking (online)","Heuristic algorithms","Data visualization","Clustering algorithms","Real-time systems","Text analysis","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Social media analysis","dynamic clustering","streaming data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Social Media","Social Platforms","Visual Analysis","Interactive","Clustering Algorithm","Social Media Platforms","Subject Of Interest","Topics Of Interest","Dynamic Algorithm","Social Media Data","Social Media Analytics","Dynamic Clustering","Summary Of Themes","Topic Summaries","Efficient Clustering","Parallel Cluster","Amount Of Change","Quantification Of Changes","Specific Topics","Specific Subject","Specific Themes","Data Streams","Topic Modeling","Clustering Process","Situational Awareness","Non-negative Matrix Factorization","Collection Of Papers","Document Collection","Latent Dirichlet Allocation","Input For Clustering","Term Frequency-inverse Document Frequency","Inverse Document Frequency","TF-IDF","Representative Items","Stacked Bar","Named Entity Recognition","Entity Extraction","Named-entity Recognition","Relevant Tweets","Different Levels Of Granularity","Basketball Players","Overview Of Themes","Overview Of Topics","Overview Of The Subject"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114765","title":"Joint t-SNE for Comparable Projections of Multiple High-Dimensional Datasets","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":58,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Shandong University, CN, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087129605","id":37087129605,"full_name":"Yinqiao Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shandong University, CN, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Shandong University, CN, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089205574","id":37089205574,"full_name":"Lu Chen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shandong University, CN, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Sungkyunkwan University, KR, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085589835","id":37085589835,"full_name":"Jaemin Jo","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sungkyunkwan University, KR, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Shandong University, CN, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085804605","id":37085804605,"full_name":"Yunhai Wang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shandong University, CN, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present Joint t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Joint t-SNE), a technique to generate comparable projections of multiple high-dimensional datasets. Although t-SNE has been widely employed to visualize high-dimensional datasets from various domains, it is limited to projecting a single dataset. When a series of high-dimensional datasets, such as datasets changing over time, is projected independently using t-SNE, misaligned layouts are obtained. Even items with identical features across datasets are projected to different locations, making the technique unsuitable for comparison tasks. To tackle this problem, we introduce edge similarity, which captures the similarities between two adjacent time frames based on the Graphlet Frequency Distribution (GFD). We then integrate a novel loss term into the t-SNE loss function, which we call vector constraints, to preserve the vectors between projected points across the projections, allowing these points to serve as visual landmarks for direct comparisons between projections. Using synthetic datasets whose ground-truth structures are known, we show that Joint t-SNE outperforms existing techniques, including Dynamic t-SNE, in terms of local coherence error, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and neighborhood preservation. We also showcase a real-world use case to visualize and compare the activation of different layers of a neural network.","article_number":"9552433","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552433","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552433/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552433/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"623","end_page":"632","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":948,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Task analysis","Optimization","Time measurement","Position measurement","Gain measurement","Distortion"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["High-dimensional data","projection","embedding","t-stochastic neighbor embedding"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Multiple Datasets","Multiple Data Sets","High-dimensional Datasets","High-dimensional Data Sets","Multiple High-dimensional Datasets","Multiple High Dimensional Datasets","Time Frame","Kullback-Leibler","Relative Entropy","Kullback Leibler","Kullback Leibler Divergence","Kullback-Leibler Divergence","KL Divergence","Single Dataset","Single Data Set","Localization Error","Neural Network Layers","Loss Term","Adjacent Frames","Comparison Task","Series Of Datasets","Series Of Data Sets","Visual Landmarks","Real-world Use Cases","Real World Use Cases","Digital Images","Internal Validity","Local Structure","Position Of Point","Data Space","Real-world Datasets","Real-world Data Sets","Red Cluster","t-SNE Projection","Smoothing Effect","Smooth Effect","Synthetic Transformations","Point In Frame","Points In Each Frame","Movement Of Point","Cluster Position","MNIST Dataset","MNIST Data Set","Clusters Of Points","Low-dimensional Space","Lower-dimensional Space"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114840","title":"ThreadStates: State-based Visual Analysis of Disease Progression","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":59,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Harvard University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543277","id":37086543277,"full_name":"Qianwen Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089208898","id":37089208898,"full_name":"Tali Mazor","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Tübingen, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089207308","id":37089207308,"full_name":"Theresa A Harbig","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Tübingen, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089205855","id":37089205855,"full_name":"Ethan Cerami","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37972937500","id":37972937500,"full_name":"Nils Gehlenborg","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"A growing number of longitudinal cohort studies are generating data with extensive patient observations across multiple timepoints. Such data offers promising opportunities to better understand the progression of diseases. However, these observations are usually treated as general events in existing visual analysis tools. As a result, their capabilities in modeling disease progression are not fully utilized. To fill this gap, we designed and implemented ThreadStates, an interactive visual analytics tool for the exploration of longitudinal patient cohort data. The focus of ThreadStates is to identify the states of disease progression by learning from observation data in a human-in-the-loop manner. We propose a novel Glyph Matrix design and combine it with a scatter plot to enable seamless identification, observation, and refinement of states. The disease progression patterns are then revealed in terms of state transitions using Sankey-based visualizations. We employ sequence clustering techniques to find patient groups with distinctive progression patterns, and to reveal the association between disease progression and patient-level features. The design and development were driven by a requirement analysis and iteratively refined based on feedback from domain experts over the course of a 10-month design study. Case studies and expert interviews demonstrate that ThreadStates can successively summarize disease states, reveal disease progression, and compare patient groups.","article_number":"9552435","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552435","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552435/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552435/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"238","end_page":"247","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":838,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Diseases","Data visualization","Hidden Markov models","Visual analytics","Cancer","Tools","Data mining"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Disease Progression","State Identification","Sequence Visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Disease Progression","Visual Analysis","Progression Analysis","Patients In Group","Cohort Of Patients","Transition State","Scatter Plot","Visualization Tool","Domain Experts","Interactive Visualization","Progression Patterns","Identification Of States","Status Identification","Interactive Visualization Tool","Relapse","High-dimensional","High-dimensional Space","Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus","Distribution Of Values","Design Process","Sequence Of Events","Transition Patterns","Sequential Pattern Mining","Itemset Mining","Sequence Mining","Variant Allele Frequency","Number Of Time Points","Number Of Timepoints","Visual Design","FLT3-ITD Mutations","Pattern Mining","Hidden Markov Model","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Minimum Description Length"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114862","title":"Left, Right, and Gender: Exploring Interaction Traces to Mitigate Human Biases","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":60,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Emory University, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085898933","id":37085898933,"full_name":"Emily Wall","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Emory University, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Tech, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087083944","id":37087083944,"full_name":"Arpit Narechania","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Tech, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Tech, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089211065","id":37089211065,"full_name":"Adam Coscia","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Tech, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Tech, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089212870","id":37089212870,"full_name":"Jamal Paden","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Tech, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Tech, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681759500","id":37681759500,"full_name":"Alex Endert","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Tech, US"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Human biases impact the way people analyze data and make decisions. Recent work has shown that some visualization designs can better support cognitive processes and mitigate cognitive biases (i.e., errors that occur due to the use of mental “shortcuts”). In this work, we explore how visualizing a user's interaction history (i.e., which data points and attributes a user has interacted with) can be used to mitigate potential biases that drive decision making by promoting conscious reflection of one's analysis process. Given an interactive scatterplot-based visualization tool, we showed interaction history in real-time while exploring data (by coloring points in the scatterplot that the user has interacted with), and in a summative format after a decision has been made (by comparing the distribution of user interactions to the underlying distribution of the data). We conducted a series of in-lab experiments and a crowd-sourced experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of interaction history interventions toward mitigating bias. We contextualized this work in a political scenario in which participants were instructed to choose a committee of 10 fictitious politicians to review a recent bill passed in the U.S. state of Georgia banning abortion after 6 weeks, where things like gender bias or political party bias may drive one's analysis process. We demonstrate the generalizability of this approach by evaluating a second decision making scenario related to movies. Our results are inconclusive for the effectiveness of interaction history (henceforth referred to as interaction traces) toward mitigating biased decision making. However, we find some mixed support that interaction traces, particularly in a summative format, can increase awareness of potential unconscious biases.","article_number":"9555923","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555923","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9555923/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9555923/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"966","end_page":"975","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":659,"insert_date":"20211001","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Measurement","Decision making","Task analysis","Data visualization","Visualization","History","Motion pictures"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Human bias","bias mitigation","decision making","visual data analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Human Bias","Human Biases","Interaction Traces","Decision-making","Decision Making","Data Distribution","Potential Bias","Potential Biases","Political Parties","Political Affiliation","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Cognitive Biases","Cognitive Bias","Implicit Bias","Unconscious Bias","Implicit Biases","Unconscious Biases","Interactive Visualization","Abortion Law","Pro-choice","Legal Abortion","Abortion Rights","Visual Design","Political Bias","Partisan Bias","Political Lens","Political Biases","Distribution Of Interactions","Awareness Of Bias","Awareness Of Biases","User Behavior","User Behaviour","Begs The Question","Properties Of Data","Data Attributes","Conscious Bias","Conscious Biases","Type Of Bias","Types Of Biases","Political Domain","Changes In Decisions","Political Task","Task Domain","Distribution Of Data Points","Low Bias","Political Party Affiliation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114786","title":"Scope2Screen: Focus+Context Techniques for Pathology Tumor Assessment in Multivariate Image Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":61,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089207562","id":37089207562,"full_name":"Jared Jessup","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085432818","id":37085432818,"full_name":"Robert Krueger","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, USA","Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089206836","id":37089206836,"full_name":"Simon Warchol","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089208909","id":37089208909,"full_name":"John Hoffer","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089208273","id":37089208273,"full_name":"Jeremy Muhlich","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089207268","id":37089207268,"full_name":"Cecily C.

Highly multiplexed tissue imaging builds on this foundation, enabling the collection of up to 60 channels of molecular information plus cell and tissue morphology using antibody staining. This provides unique insight into disease biology and promises to help with the design of patient-specific therapies. However, a substantial gap remains with respect to visualizing the resulting multivariate image data and effectively supporting pathology workflows in digital environments on screen. We, therefore, developed Scope2Screen, a scalable software system for focus+context exploration and annotation of whole-slide, high-plex, tissue images. Our approach scales to analyzing 100GB images of 109 or more pixels per channel, containing millions of individual cells. A multidisciplinary team of visualization experts, microscopists, and pathologists identified key image exploration and annotation tasks involving finding, magnifying, quantifying, and organizing regions of interest (ROIs) in an intuitive and cohesive manner. Building on a scope-to-screen metaphor, we present interactive lensing techniques that operate at single-cell and tissue levels. Lenses are equipped with task-specific functionality and descriptive statistics, making it possible to analyze image features, cell types, and spatial arrangements (neighborhoods) across image channels and scales. A fast sliding-window search guides users to regions similar to those under the lens; these regions can be analyzed and considered either separately or as part of a larger image collection. A novel snapshot method enables linked lens configurations and image statistics to be saved, restored, and shared with these regions. We validate our designs with domain experts and apply Scope2Screen in two case studies involving lung and colorectal cancers to discover cancer-relevant image features.","article_number":"9557792","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9557792","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9557792/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9557792/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"259","end_page":"269","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":679,"insert_date":"20211004","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Lenses","Tools","Task analysis","Data visualization","Annotations","Cancer","Rendering (computer graphics)"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Histopathology","Focus+Context","Image Analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Imaging Data","Multivariate Data","Cell Types","Descriptive Statistics","Interactive","Image Features","Single-cell Level","Tissue Imaging","Domain Experts","System Scale","Large Image","Channel Images","Tissue Morphology","Image Annotation","T Cells","Cell Count","Histogram","Cell Markers","Image Pixels","Multiple Channels","Multichannel Images","Image Space","Combination Of Channels","Digital Pathology","Computational Biology","Single-cell Data","Zoom Level","Low Magnification","Lens Cells","Review Of Images"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114874","title":"Modeling Just Noticeable Differences in Charts","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":62,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Shenzhen University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38238228600","id":38238228600,"full_name":"Min Lu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shenzhen University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"The University of Haifa, Israel","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294051600","id":37294051600,"full_name":"Joel Lanir","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The University of Haifa, Israel"]}},{"affiliation":"Shenzhen University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089207425","id":37089207425,"full_name":"Chufeng Wang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shenzhen University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Shenzhen University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089208914","id":37089208914,"full_name":"Yucong Yao","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shenzhen University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Shenzhen University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089207018","id":37089207018,"full_name":"Wen Zhang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shenzhen University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266781000","id":37266781000,"full_name":"Oliver Deussen","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Shenzhen University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086110259","id":37086110259,"full_name":"Hui Huang","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shenzhen University, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"One of the fundamental tasks in visualization is to compare two or more visual elements.

Perceptual laws can be used in order to model when and how we perceive this difference. In this work, we model the perception of Just Noticeable Differences (JNDs), the minimum difference in visual attributes that allow faithfully comparing similar elements, in charts. Specifically, we explore the relation between JNDs and two major visual variables: the intensity of visual elements and the distance between them, and study it in three charts: bar chart, pie chart and bubble chart. Through an empirical study, we identify main effects on JND for distance in bar charts, intensity in pie charts, and both distance and intensity in bubble charts. By fitting a linear mixed effects model, we model JND and find that JND grows as the exponential function of variables. We highlight several usage scenarios that make use of the JND modeling in which elements below the fitted JND are detected and enhanced with secondary visual cues for better discrimination.","article_number":"9552881","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552881","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552881/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552881/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"718","end_page":"726","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":913,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Bars","Task analysis","Fans","Correlation","Computational modeling","Three-dimensional displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual perception","Charts","Just noticeable difference","Modeling"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Notable Differences","Just Noticeable Difference","Just-noticeable-difference","Linear Model","Linear Regression Model","Linear Mixed Model","Mixed-effects Model","Mixed Effects Model","Linear Mixed-effects Models","Linear Mixed Effects Models","Bar Charts","Pie Chart","Visual Elements","Similar Elements","Bar Height","Height Of Each Bar","Bubble Chart","Small Differences In Values","Linear Regression","Model Assumptions","Power-law","Scaling Law","Power Law","Separation Distance","Common Scale","Neighborhood Effects","Neighbor Effects","Neighbourhood Effects","Angular Distance","Angular Separation","Pair Of Elements","Comparison Task","Object Discrimination","Visual Enhancement","Standard Stimuli","Standard Stimulus","Chart Types","Method Of Constant Stimuli","Text Annotation","Visual Channels","Display Size"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114858","title":"NeuroCartography: Scalable Automatic Visual Summarization of Concepts in Deep Neural Networks","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":63,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087106137","id":37087106137,"full_name":"Haekyu Park","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088662090","id":37088662090,"full_name":"Nilaksh Das","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087863615","id":37087863615,"full_name":"Rahul Duggal","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089206114","id":37089206114,"full_name":"Austin P.

We present Neurocartography, an interactive system that scalably summarizes and visualizes concepts learned by neural networks. It automatically discovers and groups neurons that detect the same concepts, and describes how such neuron groups interact to form higher-level concepts and the subsequent predictions. Neurocartography introduces two scalable summarization techniques: (1) neuron clustering groups neurons based on the semantic similarity of the concepts detected by neurons (e.g., neurons detecting “dog faces” of different breeds are grouped); and (2) neuron embedding encodes the associations between related concepts based on how often they co-occur (e.g., neurons detecting “dog face” and “dog tail” are placed closer in the embedding space). Key to our scalable techniques is the ability to efficiently compute all neuron pairs' relationships, in time linear to the number of neurons instead of quadratic time. Neurocartography scales to large data, such as the ImageNet dataset with 1.2M images. The system's tightly coordinated views integrate the scalable techniques to visualize the concepts and their relationships, projecting the concept associations to a 2D space in Neuron Projection View, and summarizing neuron clusters and their relationships in Graph View. Through a large-scale human evaluation, we demonstrate that our technique discovers neuron groups that represent coherent, human-meaningful concepts. And through usage scenarios, we describe how our approaches enable interesting and surprising discoveries, such as concept cascades of related and isolated concepts.

For example, to identify threats, an intelligence analyst needs to link people from a social network graph with locations on a crime-map, and then search for and read relevant documents. Currently, exploring cross-view data relationships heavily relies on view-coordination techniques (e.g., brushing and linking), which may require significant user effort on many trial-and-error attempts, such as repetitiously selecting elements in one view, and then observing and following elements highlighted in other views. To address this, we present SightBi, a visual analytics approach for supporting cross-view data relationship explorations. We discuss the design rationale of SightBi in detail, with identified user tasks regarding the use of cross-view data relationships. SightBi formalizes cross-view data relationships as biclusters, computes them from a dataset, and uses a bi-context design that highlights creating stand-alone relationship-views. This helps preserve existing views and offers an overview of cross-view data relationships to guide user exploration. Moreover, SightBi allows users to interactively manage the layout of multiple views by using newly created relationship-views. With a usage scenario, we demonstrate the usefulness of SightBi for sensemaking of cross-view data relationships.","article_number":"9555226","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555226","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9555226/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9555226/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"54","end_page":"64","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":695,"insert_date":"20210930","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Data visualization","Tools","Task analysis","Layout","Sun","Bioinformatics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Cross-view data relationship","multi-view visualization","bicluster","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["User Tasks","Overview Of The Relationship","Visual Analytics Tool","Scatter Plot","Workspace","Types Of Tasks","Partial Data","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Nodes In The Graph","Line Segment","Relational View","Visual Elements","Visual Markers","Principal Curvatures","Curved Lines","Word Co-occurrence","Set Of Views","Intelligence Reports","Visual Connection","Visual Encoding","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Map View","Neighboring Pairs","Display Area"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114869","title":"A Memory Efficient Encoding for Ray Tracing Large Unstructured Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":65,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"NVIDIA, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282958300","id":37282958300,"full_name":"Ingo Wald","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["NVIDIA, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, University of Utah and NVIDIA, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087129005","id":37087129005,"full_name":"Nate Morrical","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SCI Institute, University of Utah and NVIDIA, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Cologne, Chair of Computer Science, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087079401","id":37087079401,"full_name":"Stefan Zellmann","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Cologne, Chair of Computer Science, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In theory, efficient and high-quality rendering of unstructured data should greatly benefit from modern GPUs, but in practice, GPUs are often limited by the large amount of memory that large meshes require for element representation and for sample reconstruction acceleration structures.

Measuring inter-cluster reliability is crucial as it directly affects how well inter-cluster tasks (e.g., identifying cluster relationships in the original space from a projected view) can be conducted; however, despite the importance of inter-cluster tasks, we found that previous metrics, such as Trustworthiness and Continuity, fail to measure inter-cluster reliability. Our metrics consider two aspects of the inter-cluster reliability: Steadiness measures the extent to which clusters in the projected space form clusters in the original space, and Cohesiveness measures the opposite. They extract random clusters with arbitrary shapes and positions in one space and evaluate how much the clusters are stretched or dispersed in the other space. Furthermore, our metrics can quantify pointwise distortions, allowing for the visualization of inter-cluster reliability in a projection, which we call a reliability map. Through quantitative experiments, we verify that our metrics precisely capture the distortions that harm inter-cluster reliability while previous metrics have difficulty capturing the distortions. A case study also demonstrates that our metrics and the reliability map 1) support users in selecting the proper projection techniques or hyperparameters and 2) prevent misinterpretation while performing inter-cluster tasks, thus allow an adequate identification of inter-cluster structure.","article_number":"9552206","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552206","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552206/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552206/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"551","end_page":"561","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":935,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Distortion","Reliability","Measurement","Distortion measurement","Task analysis","Data visualization","Extraterrestrial measurements"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Multidimensional projections","MDP distortions","Inter-cluster tasks","Inter-cluster reliability","Distortion metrics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Multidimensional Projection","Hyperparameters","Cohesiveness","Original Space","Quantitative Experiments","Projective Space","Clusters In Space","Local Structure","Clustering Algorithm","Cluster Size","Point Cloud","Point Clouds","Single Cluster","Design Considerations","Real-world Datasets","Real-world Data Sets","Dense Clusters","Compact Clusters","MNIST Dataset","MNIST Data Set","Density-based Clustering","Original Cluster","Local Distortion","High Distortion","Local Metrics","Nearest Neighbor Graph","Nearest Neighbour Graph","Original Density","Distortion Types","Definition Of Distance","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Dispersed Clusters","Diffusion Of Clusters","Distance Function","Local Neighborhood","Local Neighbourhood","Local Neighbourhoods","Local Neighborhoods","Cluster Membership"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114773","title":"Simultaneous Matrix Orderings for Graph Collections","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":67,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"TU Eindhoven, the Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089206339","id":37089206339,"full_name":"Nathan van Beusekom","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Eindhoven, the Netherlands"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Eindhoven, the Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073861100","id":37073861100,"full_name":"Wouter Meulemans","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Eindhoven, the Netherlands"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Eindhoven, the Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591266000","id":37591266000,"full_name":"Bettina Speckmann","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Eindhoven, the Netherlands"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Undirected graphs are frequently used to model phenomena that deal with interacting objects, such as social networks, brain activity and communication networks. The topology of an undirected graph $G$ can be captured by an adjacency matrix; this matrix in turn can be visualized directly to give insight into the graph structure. Which visual patterns appear in such a matrix visualization crucially depends on the ordering of its rows and columns. Formally defining the quality of an ordering and then automatically computing a high-quality ordering are both challenging problems; however, effective heuristics exist and are used in practice. Often, graphs do not exist in isolation but as part of a collection of graphs on the same set of vertices, for example, brain scans over time or of different people. To visualize such graph collections, we need a single ordering that works well for all matrices simultaneously. The current state-of-the-art solves this problem by taking a (weighted) union over all graphs and applying existing heuristics. However, this union leads to a loss of information, specifically in those parts of the graphs which are different. We propose a collection-aware approach to avoid this loss of information and apply it to two popular heuristic methods: leaf order and barycenter. The de-facto standard computational quality metrics for matrix ordering capture only block-diagonal patterns (cliques). Instead, we propose to use Moran's $I$, a spatial auto-correlation metric, which captures the full range of established patterns. Moran's $I$ refines previously proposed stress measures. Furthermore, the popular leaf order method heuristically optimizes a similar measure which further supports the use of Moran's $I$ in this context. An ordering that maximizes Moran's $I$ can be computed via solutions to the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP); orderings that approximate the optimal ordering can be computed more efficiently, using any of the approximation algorithms for metric TSP. We evaluated our methods for simultaneous orderings on real-world datasets using Moran's $I$ as the quality metric. Our results show that our collection-aware approach matches or improves performance compared to the union approach, depending on the similarity of the graphs in the collection. Specifically, our Moran's $I$-based collection-aware leaf order implementation consistently outperforms other implementations. Our collection-aware implementations carry no significant additional computational costs.","article_number":"9552242","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552242","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552242/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552242/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"1","end_page":"10","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":940,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Measurement","Tools","Symmetric matrices","Current measurement","Standards","Social networking (online)"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Matrix ordering","graph visualization","algorithms","quality measures"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Heuristic","Rule Of Thumb","Undirected","Undirected Graph","Spatial Autocorrelation","Measures Of Stress","Quality Metrics","Graph Structure","Barycenter","Row Vector","Row Of Matrix","Symmetric Matrix","Symmetric Matrices","Edge Weights","Spatial Units","Vertices","Vertices Of The Graph","Isolated Vertices","Triangle Inequality","Triangular Inequality","Squared Euclidean Distance","Pair Of Vertices","Vertex Pairs","Set Of Graphs","Similar Neighbors","Similar Neighbourhoods","Neighborhood Similarity","Sparse Graph","Edge Connectivity","Edge-connectivity","Linear Arrangement","Categories Of Measures","Adjacent Measurements","Adjacent Rows","Unweighted Graph","Input Graph","Median Rank","Number Of Graphs","Salient Patterns","Line Segment"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114864","title":"Sibyl: Understanding and Addressing the Usability Challenges of Machine Learning In High-Stakes Decision Making","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":68,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"MIT, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086546930","id":37086546930,"full_name":"Alexandra Zytek","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["MIT, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"MIT, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088559342","id":37088559342,"full_name":"Dongyu Liu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["MIT, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Auckland University of Technology, New Zealand","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089207162","id":37089207162,"full_name":"Rhema Vaithianathan","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Auckland University of Technology, New Zealand"]}},{"affiliation":"MIT, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085648060","id":37085648060,"full_name":"Kalyan Veeramachaneni","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["MIT, United States"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Machine learning (ML) is being applied to a diverse and ever-growing set of domains.

Multiple ML usability challenges can appear as result, such as lack of user trust in the model, inability to reconcile human-ML disagreement, and ethical concerns about oversimplification of complex problems to a single algorithm output. In this paper, we investigate the ML usability challenges that present in the domain of child welfare screening through a series of collaborations with child welfare screeners. Following the iterative design process between the ML scientists, visualization researchers, and domain experts (child screeners), we first identified four key ML challenges and honed in on one promising explainable ML technique to address them (local factor contributions). Then we implemented and evaluated our visual analytics tool, Sibyl, to increase the interpretability and interactivity of local factor contributions. The effectiveness of our tool is demonstrated by two formal user studies with 12 non-expert participants and 13 expert participants respectively. Valuable feedback was collected, from which we composed a list of design implications as a useful guideline for researchers who aim to develop an interpretable and interactive visualization tool for ML prediction models deployed for child welfare screeners and other similar domain experts.","article_number":"9552849","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552849","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552849/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552849/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"1161","end_page":"1171","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1090,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Usability","Pediatrics","Tools","Predictive models","Decision making","Context modeling","Prediction algorithms"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Machine learning","XAI","Usability","child welfare","visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Machine Learning","Machine-learning","Usability","Ease Of Use","Prediction Model","User Study","Child Welfare","Well-being Of Children","Child Well-being","Lack Of Trust","Domain Experts","Machine Learning Prediction","Trust Model","Learning Algorithms","Machine Learning Algorithms","Protective Factors","Machine Learning Models","Risk Score","Recurrent Neural Network","Videoconferencing","Video Calls","Video Chat","Case Description","Child Abuse","Child Maltreatment","Childhood Maltreatment","Childhood Abuse","Cognitive Biases","Cognitive Bias","Detailed Case","Logic Model","Logical Form","Local Explanations","Human Decision-making","Human Decision Makers","Explainable Artificial Intelligence","Explainable AI","Explainable Machine Learning","Synthetic Generation","Screening Decisions","Via Video","Qualitative Field","Concerned Parties","Risk Prediction Models","Availability Bias","Availability Heuristic","Availability Biases"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114777","title":"Visual Evaluation for Autonomous Driving","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":69,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Data Science, Fudan University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089210459","id":37089210459,"full_name":"Yijie Hou","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Data Science, Fudan University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Data Science, Fudan University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089213072","id":37089213072,"full_name":"Chengshun Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Data Science, Fudan University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Data Science, Fudan University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089212247","id":37089212247,"full_name":"Junhong Wang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Data Science, Fudan University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Data Science, Fudan University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272718600","id":37272718600,"full_name":"Xiangyang Xue","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Data Science, Fudan University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Pennsylvania State University, Pennsylvania","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547462","id":37086547462,"full_name":"Xiaolong Luke Zhang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, Pennsylvania"]}},{"affiliation":"China FAW (Nanjing) Technology Development Co., Ltd., China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089215117","id":37089215117,"full_name":"Jun Zhu","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["China FAW (Nanjing) Technology Development Co., Ltd., China"]}},{"affiliation":"China FAW (Nanjing) Technology Development Co., Ltd., China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089213765","id":37089213765,"full_name":"Dongliang Wang","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["China FAW (Nanjing) Technology Development Co., Ltd., China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Data Science, Fudan University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085387892","id":37085387892,"full_name":"Siming Chen","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Data Science, Fudan University, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Autonomous driving technologies often use state-of-the-art artificial intelligence algorithms to understand the relationship between the vehicle and the external environment, to predict the changes of the environment, and then to plan and control the behaviors of the vehicle accordingly. The complexity of such technologies makes it challenging to evaluate the performance of autonomous driving systems and to find ways to improve them. The current approaches to evaluating such autonomous driving systems largely use a single score to indicate the overall performance of a system, but domain experts have difficulties in understanding how individual components or algorithms in an autonomous driving system may contribute to the score. To address this problem, we collaborate with domain experts on autonomous driving algorithms, and propose a visual evaluation method for autonomous driving. Our method considers the data generated in all components during the whole process of autonomous driving, including perception results, planning routes, prediction of obstacles, various controlling parameters, and evaluation of comfort. We develop a visual analytics workflow to integrate an evaluation mathematical model with adjustable parameters, support the evaluation of the system from the level of the overall performance to the level of detailed measures of individual components, and to show both evaluation scores and their contributing factors. Our implemented visual analytics system provides an overview evaluation score at the beginning and shows the animation of the dynamic change of the scores at each period. Experts can interactively explore the specific component at different time periods and identify related factors. With our method, domain experts not only learn about the performance of an autonomous driving system, but also identify and access the problematic parts of each component. Our visual evaluation system can be applied to the autonomous driving simulation system and used for various evaluation cases. The results of using our system in some simulation cases and the feedback from involved domain experts confirm the usefulness and efficiency of our method in helping people gain in-depth insight into autonomous driving systems.","article_number":"9597616","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9597616","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9597616/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9597616/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"1030","end_page":"1039","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1340,"insert_date":"20211101","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Autonomous vehicles","Data visualization","Tools","Visual analytics","Planning","Mathematical models","Testing"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Autonomous Driving","Spatiotemporal Visual Analytics","Visual Evaluation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Autonomous Vehicles","Autonomous Driving","Visual Evaluation","Visual Rating","Mathematical Model","System Performance","Evaluation Method","Evaluation Methods","Rate Method","Evaluation System","Rating System","Visual System","Visual Analysis","Rating Scores","Evaluation Scores","Visual Methods","Visual Method","Domain Experts","Interactive Exploration","Vehicle Behavior","Vehicle Behaviour","Low Scores","Modifiable Factors","Importance Of Factors","Importance Of These Factors","Weighting Factor","Cause Of Failure","Factor Scores","Design Requirements","Parallel Coordinates","Negative Ideal Solution","Negative-ideal Solution","Planning Module","Analytic Hierarchy Process","Positive Ideal Solution","Positive-ideal Solution","Judgment Matrix","Judgment Matrices","Prediction Module","Visual Design","Ideal Solution","Module Score"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114762","title":"DDLVis: Real-time Visual Query of Spatiotemporal Data Distribution via Density Dictionary Learning","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":70,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086945430","id":37086945430,"full_name":"Chenhui Li","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267405700","id":37267405700,"full_name":"George Baciu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"Suzhou University of Science and Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085699687","id":37085699687,"full_name":"Yunzhe Wang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Suzhou University of Science and Technology, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089208007","id":37089208007,"full_name":"Junjie Chen","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38008320400","id":38008320400,"full_name":"Changbo Wang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Visual query of spatiotemporal data is becoming an increasingly important function in visual analytics applications.

We propose a new visual query system that creates a low-memory storage component and provides real-time visual interactions of spatiotemporal data. We first present a peak-based kernel density estimation method to produce the data distribution for the spatiotemporal data. Then a novel density dictionary learning approach is proposed to compress temporal density maps and accelerate the query calculation. Moreover, various intuitive query interactions are presented to interactively gain patterns. The experimental results obtained on three datasets demonstrate that the presented system offers an effective query for visual analytics of spatiotemporal data.","article_number":"9552191","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552191","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552191/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552191/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"1062","end_page":"1072","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":872,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Data visualization","Real-time systems","Machine learning","Estimation","Encoding"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual query","information visualization","spatiotemporal data","data compression","interaction","density map"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Spatiotemporal Distribution","Spatiotemporal Data","Dictionary Learning","Visual Query","Interactive","Visual System","Density Estimation","Real-time Data","Density Map","Vision Applications","Query Data","Temporal Function","Temporal Map","Kernel Density Estimation Method","Spatial Variation","Air Pollution","Air Quality","Variety Of Forms","Cartographic","Types Of Datasets","Types Of Data Sets","Two-dimensional Space","Sparse Coding","Air Quality Index","Air Pollution Index","Orthogonal Matching Pursuit","Query Results","Spatial Query","Types Of Queries","Number Of Eigenvalues","Spectral Clustering Method","Spectral Clustering Methods","Data Frame","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114782","title":"An Automated Approach to Reasoning About Task-Oriented Insights in Responsive Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":71,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Northwestern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089205455","id":37089205455,"full_name":"Hyeok Kim","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Adobe Research, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085372098","id":37085372098,"full_name":"Ryan Rossi","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Adobe Research, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089206798","id":37089206798,"full_name":"Abhraneel Sarma","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Carnegie Mellon University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085711170","id":37085711170,"full_name":"Dominik Moritz","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38016234500","id":38016234500,"full_name":"Jessica Hullman","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Authors often transform a large screen visualization for smaller displays through rescaling, aggregation and other techniques when creating visualizations for both desktop and mobile devices (i.e., responsive visualization). However, transformations can alter relationships or patterns implied by the large screen view, requiring authors to reason carefully about what information to preserve while adjusting their design for the smaller display. We propose an automated approach to approximating the loss of support for task-oriented visualization insights (identification, comparison, and trend) in responsive transformation of a source visualization. We operationalize identification, comparison, and trend loss as objective functions calculated by comparing properties of the rendered source visualization to each realized target (small screen) visualization. To evaluate the utility of our approach, we train machine learning models on human ranked small screen alternative visualizations across a set of source visualizations. We find that our approach achieves an accuracy of 84% (random forest model) in ranking visualizations. We demonstrate this approach in a prototype responsive visualization recommender that enumerates responsive transformations using Answer Set Programming and evaluates the preservation of task-oriented insights using our loss measures. We discuss implications of our approach for the development of automated and semi-automated responsive visualization recommendation.","article_number":"9552592","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552592","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552592/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552592/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"129","end_page":"139","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":671,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Data visualization","Task analysis","Loss measurement","Encoding","Economic indicators","Market research"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Task-oriented insight preservation","responsive visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Prototype","Learning Models","Mobile Devices","Portable Devices","Machine Learning Models","Random Forest Model","Large Screening","Small Screen","Train Machine Learning Models","Training Data","Transposable","Aspect Ratio","Search Space","Small Loss","Pair Of Points","Distance Metrics","Gradient Boosting","Color Channels","Colour Channels","Screen Size","Visual Design","Line Chart","Target View","Earth Mover’s Distance","Positional Encoding","Style Transfer","Chart Types","Web-based Visualization","Partial Rank","Transformation Strategy","Transformation Scheme","Differential Entropy","Feature Aggregation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114822","title":"CoUX: Collaborative Visual Analysis of Think-Aloud Usability Test Videos for Digital Interfaces","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":72,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Waterloo, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089206043","id":37089206043,"full_name":"Ehsan Jahangirzadeh Soure","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Waterloo, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"Rochester Institute of Technology, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089176579","id":37089176579,"full_name":"Emily Kuang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Rochester Institute of Technology, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Rochester Institute of Technology, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085512472","id":37085512472,"full_name":"Mingming Fan","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Rochester Institute of Technology, USA","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Waterloo, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38024987300","id":38024987300,"full_name":"Jian Zhao","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Waterloo, Canada"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Reviewing a think-aloud video is both time-consuming and demanding as it requires UX (user experience) professionals to attend to many behavioral signals of the user in the video.

We propose a collaborative visual analytics tool, CoUX, to facilitate UX evaluators collectively reviewing think-aloud usability test videos of digital interfaces. CoUX seamlessly supports usability problem identification, annotation, and discussion in an integrated environment. To ease the discovery of usability problems, CoUX visualizes a set of problem-indicators based on acoustic, textual, and visual features extracted from the video and audio of a think-aloud session with machine learning. CoUX further enables collaboration amongst UX evaluators for logging, commenting, and consolidating the discovered problems with a chatbox-like user interface. We designed CoUX based on a formative study with two UX experts and insights derived from the literature. We conducted a user study with six pairs of UX practitioners on collaborative think-aloud video analysis tasks. The results indicate that CoUX is useful and effective in facilitating both problem identification and collaborative teamwork. We provide insights into how different features of CoUX were used to support both independent analysis and collaboration.

subject for debate, and until today there is broad controversy among public speaking experts about what factors make a speech effective as well as the roles of these factors in speeches. Moreover, there is a lack of quantitative analysis methods to help understand effective speaking strategies. In this paper, we propose E-ffective, a visual analytic system allowing speaking experts and novices to analyze both the role of speech factors and their contribution in effective speeches. From interviews with domain experts and investigating existing literature, we identified important factors to consider in inspirational speeches. We obtained the generated factors from multi-modal data that were then related to effectiveness data. Our system supports rapid understanding of critical factors in inspirational speeches, including the influence of emotions by means of novel visualization methods and interaction. Two novel visualizations include E-spiral (that shows the emotional shifts in speeches in a visually compact way) and E-script (that connects speech content with key speech delivery information). In our evaluation we studied the influence of our system on experts' domain knowledge about speech factors. We further studied the usability of the system by speaking novices and experts on assisting analysis of inspirational speech effectiveness.","article_number":"9555490","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555490","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9555490/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9555490/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"508","end_page":"517","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1033,"insert_date":"20210930","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Speech","Public speaking","Interviews","Measurement","Data visualization","Visual analytics","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Affective visualization","multimodal analysis","speech effectiveness"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual System","Visual Analysis","Visual Analytics System","Inspirational Speeches","Quantitative Data","Quantitative Method","Quantitative Assessment","Quantitative Research","Quantitative Studies","Quantitative Approach","Quantitative Methods","Role Of Factors","Visual Methods","Visual Method","Public Speaking","Oral Presentations","Public Speech","Guest Speakers","Effects Of Factors","New Forms","Importance Of Factors","Importance Of These Factors","Facial Expressions","User Experience","Text Data","Text Corpus","Emotion Categories","Emotion Classification","Emotion Type","User Testing","Radar Chart","Radar Graph","Visual Design","World Championships","Speech Data","Emotional Prosody","Vocal Emotion","Emotional Speech","Individual Speech","Speech Level","User Tasks","Original Video","Effective Metrics","Visual Analysis Of Data","Rule Changes","Opinion Change","Visualization Techniques"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114824","title":"Causal Support: Modeling Causal Inferences with Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":74,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Washington, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543362","id":37086543362,"full_name":"Alex Kale","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Washington, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California at Berkeley, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088660700","id":37088660700,"full_name":"Yifan Wu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California at Berkeley, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38016234500","id":38016234500,"full_name":"Jessica Hullman","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Analysts often make visual causal inferences about possible data-generating models. However, visual analytics (VA) software tends to leave these models implicit in the mind of the analyst, which casts doubt on the statistical validity of informal visual “insights”. We formally evaluate the quality of causal inferences from visualizations by adopting causal support—a Bayesian cognition model that learns the probability of alternative causal explanations given some data—as a normative benchmark for causal inferences. We contribute two experiments assessing how well crowdworkers can detect (1) a treatment effect and (2) a confounding relationship. We find that chart users' causal inferences tend to be insensitive to sample size such that they deviate from our normative benchmark. While interactively cross-filtering data in visualizations can improve sensitivity, on average users do not perform reliably better with common visualizations than they do with textual contingency tables. These experiments demonstrate the utility of causal support as an evaluation framework for inferences in VA and point to opportunities to make analysts' mental models more explicit in VA software.","article_number":"9552187","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552187","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552187/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552187/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"1150","end_page":"1160","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1067,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Data models","Diseases","Cognition","Bars","Analytical models","Benchmark testing"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Causal inference","visualization","contingency tables","data cognition"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Causal Inference","Causal Support","Alternative Explanation","Contingency Table","Cross-classification","Cross-tabulation","Visual Analysis","Mental Models","Causal Explanations","Data-generating Model","Data Generation Model","Quality Inference","Simulated Data","Difference In The Proportion","Count Data","Count Values","Proportion Of People","Simulated Datasets","Simulated Data Sets","Visual Signals","Visual Effects","Visual Events","Signal Data","Bar Charts","Visual Conditions","Visual Status","Visual Analytics Tool","Directed Acyclic Graph","Visual Design","Term In Formula","Attention Checks","Causal Reasoning","Visual Working","Degree Of Belief","Subjective Beliefs","Delta Values","Cognitive Biases","Cognitive Bias"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114766","title":"Loon: Using Exemplars to Visualize Large-Scale Microscopy Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":75,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Utah, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089207172","id":37089207172,"full_name":"Devin Lange","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Utah, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Utah, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089207371","id":37089207371,"full_name":"Eddie Polanco","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Utah, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Utah, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089206518","id":37089206518,"full_name":"Robert Judson-Torres","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Utah, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Utah, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089206275","id":37089206275,"full_name":"Thomas Zangle","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Utah, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Utah, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37395933400","id":37395933400,"full_name":"Alexander Lex","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Utah, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Which drug is most promising for a cancer patient?

To address this workflow, we developed Loon, a visualization tool for analyzing drug screening data based on quantitative phase microscopy imaging. Loon visualizes both derived data such as growth rates and imaging data. Since the images are collected automatically at a large scale, manual inspection of images and segmentations is infeasible. However, reviewing representative samples of cells is essential, both for quality control and for data analysis. We introduce a new approach for choosing and visualizing representative exemplar cells that retain a close connection to the low-level data. By tightly integrating the derived data visualization capabilities with the novel exemplar visualization and providing selection and filtering capabilities, Loon is well suited for making decisions about which drugs are suitable for a specific patient.","article_number":"9552235","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552235","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552235/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552235/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"248","end_page":"258","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":643,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Image segmentation","Microscopy","Imaging","Cancer","Tools","Tumors"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Microscopy Visualization","Cancer Cell Lines","Exemplars","Design Study"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114795","title":"Edge-Path Bundling: A Less Ambiguous Edge Bundling Approach","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":76,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"TU Wien, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656289","id":37088656289,"full_name":"Markus Wallinger","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Wien, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Swansea University, United Kingdom","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396011500","id":37396011500,"full_name":"Daniel Archambault","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Swansea University, United Kingdom"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Bordeaux, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282996500","id":37282996500,"full_name":"David Auber","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bordeaux, France"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Wien, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396024700","id":37396024700,"full_name":"Martin Nöllenburg","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Wien, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Tampere University, Finland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37410843300","id":37410843300,"full_name":"Jaakko Peltonen","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tampere University, Finland"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Edge bundling techniques cluster edges with similar attributes (i.e. similarity in direction and proximity) together to reduce the visual clutter. All edge bundling techniques to date implicitly or explicitly cluster groups of individual edges, or parts of them, together based on these attributes. These clusters can result in ambiguous connections that do not exist in the data. Confluent drawings of networks do not have these ambiguities, but require the layout to be computed as part of the bundling process. We devise a new bundling method, Edge-Path bundling, to simplify edge clutter while greatly reducing ambiguities compared to previous bundling techniques. Edge-Path bundling takes a layout as input and clusters each edge along a weighted, shortest path to limit its deviation from a straight line. Edge-Path bundling does not incur independent edge ambiguities typically seen in all edge bundling methods, and the level of bundling can be tuned through shortest path distances, Euclidean distances, and combinations of the two. Also, directed edge bundling naturally emerges from the model. Through metric evaluations, we demonstrate the advantages of Edge-Path bundling over other techniques.","article_number":"9552919","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552919","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552919/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552919/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"313","end_page":"323","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":847,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Layout","Image edge detection","Clutter","Windings","Roads","Visualization","Lakes"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Graph/network and tree data","algorithms","edge bundling"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Edge Bundling","Straight Line","Shortest Path","Edge Clustering","Edge Groups","Undirected","Undirected Graph","Grid Cells","Control Points","Noise In Data","East Coast","Quality Metrics","Graph Structure","Smoothing Parameter","Linear Graph","Path Graph","Straight-line Distance","Dijkstra’s Algorithm","Dijkstra Algorithm","Polyline","Great Lakes Region","Graph Layout","Graph Drawing","Maximum Distortion","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Image-based Techniques","Imaging-based Techniques","High Ambiguity","Highly Ambiguous","Real-world Datasets","Real-world Data Sets"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114817","title":"An Efficient Dual-Hierarchy t-SNE Minimization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":77,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Delft University of Technology, Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086481015","id":37086481015,"full_name":"Mark van de Ruit","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Delft University of Technology, Netherlands"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Leeds, England","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085562431","id":37085562431,"full_name":"Markus Billeter","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Leeds, England"]}},{"affiliation":"Delft University of Technology, Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37829332900","id":37829332900,"full_name":"Elmar Eisemann","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Delft University of Technology, Netherlands"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) has become a standard for exploratory data analysis, as it is capable of revealing clusters even in complex data while requiring minimal user input. While its run-time complexity limited it to small datasets in the past, recent efforts improved upon the expensive similarity computations and the previously quadratic minimization. Nevertheless, t-SNE still has high runtime and memory costs when operating on millions of points. We present a novel method for executing the t-SNE minimization. While our method overall retains a linear runtime complexity, we obtain a significant performance increase in the most expensive part of the minimization. We achieve a significant improvement without a noticeable decrease in accuracy even when targeting a 3D embedding. Our method constructs a pair of spatial hierarchies over the embedding, which are simultaneously traversed to approximate many N-body interactions at once. We demonstrate an efficient GPGPU implementation and evaluate its performance against state-of-the-art methods on a variety of datasets.","article_number":"9552856","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552856","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552856/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552856/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"614","end_page":"622","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":479,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Minimization","Runtime","Complexity theory","Kernel","Three-dimensional displays","Graphics processing units","Force"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["High dimensional data","dimensionality reduction","parallel data structures","dual-hierarchy","GPGPU"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Small Datasets","Small Data Sets","T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding","T-SNE","Similarity Calculation","Similarity Computation","Linear Complexity","Runtime Complexity","Spatial Hierarchy","Millions Of Points","Discretion","Center Of Mass","Center-of-mass","Center Of Gravity","Bounding Box","Repulsive Forces","Latent Space","Embedding Space","Root Node","Parent Node","Vector Field","Pair Of Nodes","Attractive Forces","Levels Of Hierarchy","Local Neighborhood","Local Neighbourhood","Local Neighbourhoods","Local Neighborhoods","Linear Time","Leaf Node","MNIST Dataset","MNIST Data Set","Google News","Discrete Field","Discrete Form","Most Significant Bit","High Bit","Highest Bit","Breadth-first Search","Breadth First Search","Breadth-first","Position Embedding","Third Dimension","Gradient Descent","Steepest Descent","Consecutive Iterations"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114779","title":"Improving Visualization Interpretation Using Counterfactuals","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":78,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Dept. of Computer Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655762","id":37088655762,"full_name":"Smiti Kaul","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"RENCI, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295624700","id":37295624700,"full_name":"David Borland","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["RENCI, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604309600","id":37604309600,"full_name":"Nan Cao","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Information and Library Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601397400","id":37601397400,"full_name":"David Gotz","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Information and Library Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Complex, high-dimensional data is used in a wide range of domains to explore problems and make decisions. Analysis of high-dimensional data, however, is vulnerable to the hidden influence of confounding variables, especially as users apply ad hoc filtering operations to visualize only specific subsets of an entire dataset. Thus, visual data-driven analysis can mislead users and encourage mistaken assumptions about causality or the strength of relationships between features. This work introduces a novel visual approach designed to reveal the presence of confounding variables via counterfactual possibilities during visual data analysis. It is implemented in CoFact, an interactive visualization prototype that determines and visualizes counterfactual subsets to better support user exploration of feature relationships. Using publicly available datasets, we conducted a controlled user study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach; the results indicate that users exposed to counterfactual visualizations formed more careful judgments about feature-to-outcome relationships.","article_number":"9552190","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552190","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552190/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552190/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"998","end_page":"1008","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":880,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Social networking (online)","Data analysis","Tools","Machine learning","Analytical models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["visualization","counterfactuals","human-computer interaction","human-centered computing","empirical study"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Causality","Interactive","Data Visualization","User Study","Visual Analysis","Filtration Performance","Filtering Operation","High-dimensional Data Analysis","High Dimensional Data Analysis","Visual Analysis Of Data","Social Media","Social Platforms","Outcome Of Interest","Interesting Results","Low Scores","Visual System","Subset Of Data","Exploratory Data","Distribution Of Outcomes","Results Of Distribution","Actual Knowledge","Actionable Insights","Causal Analysis","Complex Datasets","Complex Data Sets","Recidivism","Reoffending","Directed Acyclic Graph","Counterfactual Thinking","Counterfactual Thoughts","Stage Of Data Analysis","User Confidence","Lower Levels Of Happiness","Inactive Individuals","Visual Interface","Explainable Artificial Intelligence","Explainable AI","Explainable Machine Learning","Counterfactual Conditionals","Subjunctive Conditionals","Contrary To Fact","Treatment Groups","Intervention Group","High Scores"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114827","title":"Lumos: Increasing Awareness of Analytic Behavior during Visual Data Analysis","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":79,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087083944","id":37087083944,"full_name":"Arpit Narechania","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089211065","id":37089211065,"full_name":"Adam Coscia","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Emory University, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085898933","id":37085898933,"full_name":"Emily Wall","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Emory University, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681759500","id":37681759500,"full_name":"Alex Endert","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, United States"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Visual data analysis tools provide people with the agency and flexibility to explore data using a variety of interactive functionalities.

For example, users may overemphasize specific attributes and/or their values (e.g., Gender is always encoded on the X axis), underemphasize others (e.g., Religion is never encoded), ignore a subset of the data (e.g., older people are filtered out), etc. In response, we present Lumos, a visual data analysis tool that captures and shows the interaction history with data to increase awareness of such analytic behaviors. Using in-situ (at the place of interaction) and ex-situ (in an external view) visualization techniques, Lumos provides real-time feedback to users for them to reflect on their activities. For example, Lumos highlights datapoints that have been previously examined in the same visualization (in-situ) and also overlays them on the underlying data distribution (i.e., baseline distribution) in a separate visualization (ex-situ). Through a user study with 24 participants, we investigate how Lumos helps users' data exploration and decision-making processes. We found that Lumos increases users' awareness of visual data analysis practices in real-time, promoting reflection upon and acknowledgement of their intentions and potentially influencing subsequent interactions.","article_number":"9552196","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552196","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552196/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552196/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"1009","end_page":"1018","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":566,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Data analysis","Measurement","History","Hidden Markov models","Data models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["visual data analysis","interaction traces","analytic provenance","awareness","human bias"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Awareness Of Behaviors","Awareness Of Behaviour","Visual Analysis Of Data","Analytic Behavior","Analytical Behaviour","Behavior Of Analytes","Data Distribution","Exploratory Data","Visualization Tool","Place Of Interaction","Underlying Data Distribution","External View","Visual Analytics Tool","Control Condition","Running Time","Scatter Plot","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Cognitive Biases","Cognitive Bias","User Behavior","User Behaviour","Interaction Behavior","Bar Charts","Detailed View","Target Distribution","White Point","Distribution Of Interactions","Chart Types","Split-plot","Split-plot Design","Properties Of The Dataset","Attributes In The Dataset","Implicit Bias","Unconscious Bias","Implicit Biases","Unconscious Biases","Perceptual Bias","Perceptual Biases","Female Applicants","Fireplace"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114868","title":"Sequen-C: A Multilevel Overview of Temporal Event Sequences","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":80,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087129406","id":37087129406,"full_name":"Jessica Magallanes","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Centre for Urgent and Emergency Care Research, University of Sheffield, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089208916","id":37089208916,"full_name":"Tony Stone","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Centre for Urgent and Emergency Care Research, University of Sheffield, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, University of Sheffield, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089205215","id":37089205215,"full_name":"Paul D Morris","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, University of Sheffield, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Centre for Urgent and Emergency Care Research, University of Sheffield, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089206051","id":37089206051,"full_name":"Suzanne Mason","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Centre for Urgent and Emergency Care Research, University of Sheffield, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272460200","id":37272460200,"full_name":"Steven Wood","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38277136900","id":38277136900,"full_name":"Maria-Cruz Villa-Uriol","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield, UK"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Building a visual overview of temporal event sequences with an optimal level-of-detail (i.e. simplified but informative) is an ongoing challenge - expecting the user to zoom into every important aspect of the overview can lead to missing insights. We propose a technique to build a multilevel overview of event sequences, whose granularity can be transformed across sequence clusters (vertical level-of-detail) or longitudinally (horizontal level-of-detail), using hierarchical aggregation and a novel cluster data representation Align-Score-Simplify. By default, the overview shows an optimal number of sequence clusters obtained through the average silhouette width metric - then users are able to explore alternative optimal sequence clusterings. The vertical level-of-detail of the overview changes along with the number of clusters, whilst the horizontal level-of-detail refers to the level of summarization applied to each cluster representation. The proposed technique has been implemented into a visualization system called Sequence Cluster Explorer (Sequen-C) that allows multilevel and detail-on-demand exploration through three coordinated views, and the inspection of data attributes at cluster, unique sequence, and individual sequence level. We present two case studies using real-world datasets in the healthcare domain: CUREd and MIMIC-III; which demonstrate how the technique can aid users to obtain a summary of common and deviating pathways, and explore data attributes for selected patterns.","article_number":"9557226","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9557226","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9557226/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9557226/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"901","end_page":"911","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":736,"insert_date":"20211001","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Aggregates","Visual analytics","Feature extraction","Measurement","Data visualization","Scalability","MIMICs"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Temporal event sequence visualization","clustering","hierarchical aggregation","multiple sequence alignment"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Sequence Of Events","Temporal Sequence","Overview Of Sequencing","Temporal Sequence Of Events","Visual System","Unique Sequences","Individual Sequences","Real-world Datasets","Real-world Data Sets","Average Width","Average Widths","Ongoing Challenge","Cluster Representatives","Visual Overview","Average Silhouette Width","Multiple Sequence Alignment","Multiple Alignment","Domain Experts","Child Nodes","Children Nodes","Clinical Domain","Unified View","Surgical Intensive Care Unit","Surgical ICU","Left Child","Left Children","Cluster C1","Chart Types","Visual Encoding","Number Of Unique Sequences","Sequential Pattern Mining","Itemset Mining","Sequence Mining","Cluster C3","Cluster C2","Clickstream","Overview Of Patterns"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114784","title":"AffectiveTDA: Using Topological Data Analysis to Improve Analysis and Explainability in Affective Computing","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":81,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Massachusetts, Amherst, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089213488","id":37089213488,"full_name":"Hamza Elhamdadi","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Massachusetts, Amherst, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of South Florida, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38266035700","id":38266035700,"full_name":"Shaun Canavan","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of South Florida, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of South Florida, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37398611400","id":37398611400,"full_name":"Paul Rosen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of South Florida, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present an approach utilizing Topological Data Analysis to study the structure of face poses used in affective computing, i.e., the process of recognizing human emotion.

Our method conforms to established form guidelines for Euler diagrams regarding semantics, aesthetics, and readability. First, we establish an initial ordering of the data, which we then use to incrementally create a planar, connected, and monotone dual graph representation. In the next step, the graph is transformed into a circular layout that maintains the semantics and yields simple Euler diagrams with smooth curves. When the data cannot be represented by simple diagrams, our algorithm always falls back to a solution that is not well-formed but still well-matched, whereas previous methods often fail to produce expected results. We show the usefulness of our method for visualizing set-typed data using examples from text analysis and infographics.

We introduce Network Hypothetical Outcome Plots (NetHOPs), a visualization technique that animates a sequence of network realizations sampled from a network distribution defined by probabilistic edges. NetHOPs employ an aggregation and anchoring algorithm used in dynamic and longitudinal graph drawing to parameterize layout stability for uncertainty estimation. We present a community matching algorithm to enable visualizing the uncertainty of cluster membership and community occurrence. We describe the results of a study in which 51 network experts used NetHOPs to complete a set of common visual analysis tasks and reported how they perceived network structures and properties subject to uncertainty. Participants' estimates fell, on average, within 11% of the ground truth statistics, suggesting NetHOPs can be a reasonable approach for enabling network analysts to reason about multiple properties under uncertainty. Participants appeared to articulate the distribution of network statistics slightly more accurately when they could manipulate the layout anchoring and the animation speed. Based on these findings, we synthesize design recommendations for developing and using animated visualizations for probabilistic networks.","article_number":"9552465","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552465","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552465/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552465/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"443","end_page":"453","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":548,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Probabilistic logic","Visualization","Uncertainty","Layout","Task analysis","Stability analysis","Encoding"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Network","Uncertainty","Application"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Probabilistic Graph","Hypothetical Outcomes","Hypothetical Results","Hypothetical Outcome Plots","Path Length","Path Lengths","Statistical Distribution","Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function","Empirical Distribution Function","Visual Analysis","Visual Task","Network Properties","Visual Network","Network Diagram","Cluster Membership","Analysis Tasks","Real Networks","Common Tasks","Network Statistics","Static Network","Probabilistic Network","Graph Layout","Graph Drawing","Edge Probability","Animal Speed","Exploratory Analysis","Exploratory Data Analysis","Graphical Elements","Probabilistic Graphical Models","Community Detection Algorithm","Earth Mover’s Distance","Convex Hull","Community Detection","Node Color","Node Colour","Visual Parameters","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Probability Estimates"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114860","title":"Semantic Snapping for Guided Multi-View Visualization Design","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":84,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Norway","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089208910","id":37089208910,"full_name":"Yngve S.

A common example are dashboards, which are frequently used in domains such as finance, process monitoring and business intelligence. However, users may not be aware of existing guidelines and lack expert design knowledge when composing such multi-view visualizations. In this paper, we present semantic snapping, an approach to help non-expert users design effective multi-view visualizations from sets of pre-existing views. When a particular view is placed on a canvas, it is “aligned” with the remaining views-not with respect to its geometric layout, but based on aspects of the visual encoding itself, such as how data dimensions are mapped to channels.

Although it is impossible to super-sample all particles of large-scale data at interactive rates, efficient occlusion culling can decouple the overall data size from a high effective sampling rate of visible particles. However, while the latter is essential for domain scientists to be able to see important data features, performing occlusion culling by sampling or sorting the data is usually slow or error-prone due to visibility estimates of insufficient quality. We present a novel probabilistic culling architecture for super-sampled high-quality rendering of large particle data. Occlusion is dynamically determined at the sub-pixel level, without explicit visibility sorting or data simplification. We introduce confidence maps to probabilistically estimate confidence in the visibility data gathered so far. This enables progressive, confidence-based culling, helping to avoid wrong visibility decisions. In this way, we determine particle visibility with high accuracy, although only a small part of the data set is sampled. This enables extensive super-sampling of (partially) visible particles for high rendering quality, at a fraction of the cost of sampling all particles. For real-time performance with millions of particles, we exploit novel features of recent GPU architectures to group particles into two hierarchy levels, combining fine-grained culling with high frame rates.","article_number":"9552900","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552900","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552900/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552900/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"573","end_page":"582","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":581,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Probabilistic logic","Rendering (computer graphics)","Data visualization","Graphics processing units","Costs","Standards","Density functional theory"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Large-scale particle data","sub-pixel occlusion culling","super-sampling","anti-aliasing","coverage","probabilistic methods"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Confidence Map","Molecular Dynamics Simulations","Large-scale Data","Large Scale Data","Visible Particles","Particle Size","Expected Value","Point Cloud","Point Clouds","Probability Estimates","Bounding Box","Particle Density","Hoarding","Billboards","Probabilistic Approach","Depth Values","Multiple Iterations","Confidence Value","Caching","Log Base","Logarithm Base","Ray Tracing","Group Of Particles","Pyramid Level","Ray Casting","Ray Shooting","Screen Space","Minimum Bounding Box","Axis-aligned Bounding Box","Occlusion Test","Recurrence Relation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114805","title":"Professional Differences: A Comparative Study of Visualization Task Performance and Spatial Ability Across Disciplines","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":86,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Temple University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085607701","id":37085607701,"full_name":"Kyle Wm.

However, an individual's personality traits and cognitive abilities may also influence visualization use. Diverse user needs and abilities raise natural questions for specificity in visualization design: Could individuals from different domains exhibit performance differences when using visualizations? Are any systematic variations related to their cognitive abilities? This study bridges domain-specific perspectives on visualization design with those provided by cognition and perception. We measure variations in visualization task performance across chemistry, computer science, and education, and relate these differences to variations in spatial ability. We conducted an online study with over 60 domain experts consisting of tasks related to pie charts, isocontour plots, and 3D scatterplots, and grounded by a well-documented spatial ability test. Task performance (correctness) varied with profession across more complex visualizations (isocontour plots and scatterplots), but not pie charts, a comparatively common visualization. We found that correctness correlates with spatial ability, and the professions differ in terms of spatial ability. These results indicate that domains differ not only in the specifics of their data and tasks, but also in terms of how effectively their constituent members engage with visualizations and their cognitive traits. Analyzing participants' confidence and strategy comments suggests that focusing on performance neglects important nuances, such as differing approaches to engage with even common visualizations and potential skill transference. Our findings offer a fresh perspective on discipline-specific visualization with specific recommendations to help guide visualization design that celebrates the uniqueness of the disciplines and individuals we seek to serve.","article_number":"9572234","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9572234","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9572234/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9572234/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"654","end_page":"664","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":545,"insert_date":"20211014","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Task analysis","Visualization","Cognition","Training","Three-dimensional displays","Navigation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["visualization","spatial ability","perception","task performance","discipline","domain-specific","empirical evaluation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Disciplines","Task Performance","Visual Task","Spatial Ability","Cognitive Function","Cognitive Performance","Cognitive Skills","Cognitive Abilities","Personality Traits","Computer Science","Individual Ability","Domain Experts","Target Domain","Pie Chart","Transferable Skills","Visual Design","Cognitive Traits","3D Scatter Plot","3D Scatterplot","Differences In Performance","Completion Time","Professional Groups","Participation In Education","3D Surface","Differences In Cognitive Abilities","Ability Of People","Mental Rotation","Differences In Task Performance","Individual Disciplines","Language Differences","Slice Size","Size Of Each Slice","3D Surface Plots","2D Views","Data Literacy"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114849","title":"Interactive Data Comics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":87,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Edinburgh, Scotland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655932","id":37088655932,"full_name":"Zezhong Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Edinburgh, Scotland"]}},{"affiliation":"ETH Zurich, Switzerland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085809607","id":37085809607,"full_name":"Hugo Romat","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["ETH Zurich, Switzerland"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Toronto, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37395495900","id":37395495900,"full_name":"Fanny Chevalier","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Toronto, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590950700","id":37590950700,"full_name":"Nathalie Henry Riche","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Delft, Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089392140","id":37089392140,"full_name":"Dave Murray-Rust","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Delft, Netherlands"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Edinburgh, Scotland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085687578","id":37085687578,"full_name":"Benjamin Bach","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Edinburgh, Scotland"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"This paper investigates how to make data comics interactive. Data comics are an effective and versatile means for visual communication, leveraging the power of sequential narration and combined textual and visual content, while providing an overview of the storyline through panels assembled in expressive layouts. While a powerful static storytelling medium that works well on paper support, adding interactivity to data comics can enable non-linear storytelling, personalization, levels of details, explanations, and potentially enriched user experiences. This paper introduces a set of operations tailored to support data comics narrative goals that go beyond the traditional linear, immutable storyline curated by a story author. The goals and operations include adding and removing panels into pre-defined layouts to support branching, change of perspective, or access to detail-on-demand, as well as providing and modifying data, and interacting with data representation, to support personalization and reader-defined data focus. We propose a lightweight specification language, COMICSCRIPT, for designers to add such interactivity to static comics. To assess the viability of our authoring process, we recruited six professional illustrators, designers and data comics enthusiasts and asked them to craft an interactive comic, allowing us to understand authoring workflow and potential of our approach. We present examples of interactive comics in a gallery. This initial step towards understanding the design space of interactive comics can inform the design of creation tools and experiences for interactive storytelling.","article_number":"9552591","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552591","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552591/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552591/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"944","end_page":"954","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1331,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Tools","Layout","Visualization","Media","Space exploration","Navigation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data comics","Non-linear narrative","interactive storytelling"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Narrative","Design Tool","Ideal Tool","Design Space","Set Of Operations","Change Of Perspective","Audience","Creativity","Creative Thinking","Types Of Interactions","Personal Data","Learning Curve","Learning Time","Creative Process","Postgraduate Students","Reading Experience","Vector Graphics","Version Of Vector","Vector Format","Image Vector","Visual Elements","Creative Ideas","Visual Design","Individual Panels","Version Of The Story","Panel Setting","PNG Files","Multiple Panels","Prototype Tool","Specific Layout","Adobe Photoshop","Value For Interaction","Infographic","Graphical Display"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114812","title":"matExplorer: Visual Exploration on Predicting Ionic Conductivity for Solid-state Electrolytes","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":88,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"VisBig Lab, School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086810194","id":37086810194,"full_name":"Jiansu Pu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VisBig Lab, School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, China"]}},{"affiliation":"VisBig Lab, School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088874827","id":37088874827,"full_name":"Hui Shao","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VisBig Lab, School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, China"]}},{"affiliation":"VisBig Lab, School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088873464","id":37088873464,"full_name":"Boyang Gao","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VisBig Lab, School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, China"]}},{"affiliation":"VisBig Lab, School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088874894","id":37088874894,"full_name":"Zhengguo Zhu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VisBig Lab, School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Shenzhen Clean Energy Research Institute, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088873556","id":37088873556,"full_name":"Yanlin Zhu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shenzhen Clean Energy Research Institute, China"]}},{"affiliation":"VisBig Lab, School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085992116","id":37085992116,"full_name":"Yunbo Rao","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VisBig Lab, School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, China"]}},{"affiliation":"VisBig Lab, School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089885172","id":37089885172,"full_name":"Yong Xiang","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VisBig Lab, School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are widely used as important energy sources for mobile phones, electric vehicles, and drones.

In a classic study in behavioral economics, Benartzi and Thaler (1999) found evidence using bar charts that investors exhibit myopic loss aversion in retirement decisions: Investors overly focus on the potential for short-term losses, leading them to invest less in riskier assets and miss out on higher long-term returns. Recently, advances in uncertainty visualizations have shown improvements in decision-making under uncertainty in a variety of tasks. In this paper, we conduct a controlled and incentivized crowdsourced experiment replicating Benartzi and Thaler (1999) and extending it to measure the effect of different uncertainty representations on myopic loss aversion. Consistent with the original study, we find evidence of myopic loss aversion with bar charts and find that participants make better investment decisions with longer evaluation periods. We also find that common uncertainty representations such as interval plots and bar charts achieve the highest mean expected returns while other uncertainty visualizations lead to poorer long-term performance and strong effects on the equity premium. Qualitative feedback further suggests that different uncertainty representations lead to visual reasoning heuristics that can either mitigate or encourage a focus on potential short-term losses. We discuss implications of our results on using uncertainty visualizations for retirement decisions in practice and possible extensions for future work.","article_number":"9548797","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9548797","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9548797/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9548797/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"454","end_page":"464","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":594,"insert_date":"20210927","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty","Retirement","Visualization","Investment","Resource management","Economics","Bars"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty visualizations","myopic loss aversion","retirement investing","equity premium puzzle"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Investment Decisions","Loss Aversion","Loss-averse","Equity Premium","Equity Risk Premium","Equity Premium Puzzle","Uncertainty Visualization","Retirement Investment","Myopic Loss Aversion","Heuristic","Rule Of Thumb","Crowdsourcing","Evaluation Period","Evaluation Periods","Rate In Period","Higher Returns","Higher Payoff","Bar Charts","Behavioral Economics","Behavioural Economics","Qualitative Feedback","Long-term Issues","Long-term Returns","Short-term Loss","Risky Assets","Representation Of Uncertainty","Future Extension Of This Work","Probability Density","Investment Period","Investment Periods","Visual Encoding","Highest Return","Dot Plots","Prospect Theory","Financial Decision-making","Financial Decision Making","Optimal Decision","Risk Aversion","Risk Attitudes","Risk Tolerance","Risk-averse","Allocation Decisions","Sampling With Replacement"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114759","title":"Automatic Polygon Layout for Primal-Dual Visualization of Hypergraphs","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":91,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100795","id":37087100795,"full_name":"Botong Qu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37398562200","id":37398562200,"full_name":"Eugene Zhang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085665492","id":37085665492,"full_name":"Yue Zhang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, United States"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"N-ary relationships, which relate $N$ entities where $N$ is not necessarily two, can be visually represented as polygons whose vertices are the entities of the relationships.

Recognizing the duality between entities and relationships in the data, we provide a second visualization in which the roles of entities and relationships in the original data are reversed. This can lead to additional insight about the data. Furthermore, we enhance our framework for a joint optimization on the primal layout (original data) and the dual layout (where the roles of entities and relationships are reversed). This allows users to inspect their data using two complementary views. We apply our visualization approach to a number of datasets that include co-authorship data and social contact pattern data.","article_number":"9552233","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552233","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552233/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552233/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"633","end_page":"642","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":584,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Layout","Data visualization","Optimization","Visualization","Manuals","Linear programming","Electrical engineering"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Hypergraph visualization","N-ary relationships","optimization","polygon layout","duality","primal-dual visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Automatic Layout","Objective Function","Rational Design","Design Principles","Related Data","Optimization Framework","Joint Optimization","Number Of Principles","Number Of Rationales","Large Datasets","Large Data Sets","Binding Energy","User Study","Line Segment","Visualization Techniques","Line Search","Line-search","Manual Editing","Data Nodes","Polygon Area","Polygon Areas","Vertex Position","Positions Of Vertices","Layout Optimization","Automatic Optimization","Vertex Locations","Locations Of Vertices","Dual View","Ordering Of The Vertices","Vertex Order","Metro Line","Ideal Length","Ideal Lengths","Number Of Polygons","Circumcircle","Circumradius","Circumscribed Circle","Circumcenter","Visual Metaphors","Social Networks","Regular Polygon"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114796","title":"DIEL: Interactive Visualization Beyond the Here and Now","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":92,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of California, Berkeley, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088660700","id":37088660700,"full_name":"Yifan Wu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Tufts University, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592409400","id":37592409400,"full_name":"Remco Chang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tufts University, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Berkeley, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38183421000","id":38183421000,"full_name":"Joseph M.

However, for more complex use cases-e.g., remote database access and streaming data sources-developers must grapple with distributed data and asynchronous events. Currently, constructing these use cases is difficult and time-consuming; developers are forced to operationally program low-level details like asynchronous database querying and reactive event handling. This approach is in stark contrast to modern methods for browser-based interactive visualization, which feature high-level declarative specifications. In response, we present DIEL, a declarative framework that supports asynchronous events over distributed data. As in many declarative languages, DIEL developers specify only what data they want, rather than procedural steps for how to assemble it. Uniquely, DIEL models asynchronous events (e.g., user interactions, server responses) as streams of data that are captured in event logs. To specify the state of a visualization at any time, developers write declarative queries over the data and event logs; DIEL compiles and optimizes a corresponding dataflow graph, and automatically generates necessary low-level distributed systems details. We demonstrate DIEL'S performance and expressivity through example interactive visualizations that make diverse use of remote data and asynchronous events. We further evaluate DIEL'S usability using the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework, revealing wins such as ease of change, and compromises such as premature commitments.","article_number":"9552893","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552893","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552893/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552893/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"737","end_page":"746","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":579,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Distributed databases","Databases","Programming","Libraries","Visual databases","Servers"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Interactive Visualization Toolkit/Library","Scalability","Asynchrony"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive Visualization","Distribution System","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Data Streams","Visual Design","Event Log","Visual System","Data Transformation","System Database","Selection Of Values","Relational Database","Related Queries","Local Database","Network Bandwidth","Data Bandwidth","Modulation Bandwidth","Internet Bandwidth","Caching","Interface States","Interface Conditions","Query Results","Remote Server","Related Languages","Execution Plan","Dependency Graph","Logical Constraints","Running Example","Current Prototype","Cloud Database","Visualization Library","Text Query","User Experience","User-defined Function","User Defined Function","Prototype Implementation","Serialized"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114845","title":"GenNI: Human-AI Collaboration for Data-Backed Text Generation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":93,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"IBM Research & MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38108845300","id":38108845300,"full_name":"Hendrik Strobelt","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IBM Research & MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Cornell University, New York, New York, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089206918","id":37089206918,"full_name":"Jambay Kinley","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Cornell University, New York, New York, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Visual Computing Group, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085432818","id":37085432818,"full_name":"Robert Krueger","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Computing Group, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Visual Computing Group, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37409575800","id":37409575800,"full_name":"Johanna Beyer","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Computing Group, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Visual Computing Group, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275698100","id":37275698100,"full_name":"Hanspeter Pfister","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Computing Group, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Cornell University, New York, New York, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086236961","id":37086236961,"full_name":"Alexander M.

specification. In case of a violation, a counterexample that shows the erroneous behavior is returned. Understanding these counterexamples is challenging, especially for hyperproperty specifications, i.e., specifications that relate multiple executions of a system to each other. We aim to facilitate the visual analysis of such counterexamples through our HyperVis tool, which provides interactive visualizations of the given model, specification, and counterexample. Within an iterative and interdisciplinary design process, we developed visualization solutions that can effectively communicate the core aspects of the model checking result. Specifically, we introduce graphical representations of binary values for improving pattern recognition, color encoding for better indicating related aspects, visually enhanced textual descriptions, as well as extensive cross-view highlighting mechanisms. Further, through an underlying causal analysis of the counterexample, we are also able to identify values that contributed to the violation and use this knowledge for both improved encoding and highlighting. Finally, the analyst can modify both the specification of the hyperproperty and the system directly within HyperVis and initiate the model checking of the new version. In combination, these features notably support the analyst in understanding the error leading to the counterexample as well as iterating the provided system and specification. We ran multiple case studies with HyperVis and tested it with domain experts in qualitative feedback sessions. The participants' positive feedback confirms the considerable improvement over the manual, text-based status quo and the value of the tool for explaining hyperproperties.","article_number":"9552899","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552899","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552899/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552899/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"357","end_page":"367","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":570,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Model checking","Visualization","Integrated circuit modeling","Tools","Computational modeling","Encoding","Process control"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Analyzing Counterexamples","Hyperproperties","Multiple Coordinate Views","Explainable Formal Methods"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Model Checking","Interactive","Iterative Process","Design Process","Domain Experts","Causal Analysis","Iterative Design","Loop Design","Multiple Case Study","Multiple-case Study","Feedback Sessions","Iterative Design Process","Time Step","Mutually Exclusive","System Description","Formal Methods","Formal Techniques","Formal Method","State Machine","Finite-state","Finite State","Finite State Machine","Finite-state Machine","Transit System","Design Goals","Markup Language","Visual Design","Temporal Operators","Hardware Circuit","Critical Section","Project Version","Text Generation","Sentence Generation","Natural Language Generation","Current Workflow","Think-aloud Protocols","Explainable Artificial Intelligence","Explainable AI","Explainable Machine Learning"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114818","title":"Explanatory Journeys: Visualising to Understand and Explain Administrative Justice Paths of Redress","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":95,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Bangor University, United Kingdom","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37278794800","id":37278794800,"full_name":"Jonathan C.

Explanatory visualisation has the potential to display these paths of redress in a clear way, such that people can see, understand and explore their options. The visualisation challenge is further complicated because information is spread across many documents, laws, guidance and policies and requires judicial interpretation. Consequently, there is not a single database of paths of redress. In this work we present how we have co-designed a system to visualise administrative justice paths of redress.

Diatoms allows for a degree of randomness while respecting constraints imposed by columns in a data table: their data types and domains as well as semantic associations between columns as specified by the designer. We pair this generative design process with two forms of interactive design externalization that enable comparison and critique of the design alternatives. First, we incorporate a familiar small multiples configuration in which every data point is drawn according to a single glyph design, coupled with the ability to page between alternative glyph designs. Second, we propose a small permutables design gallery, in which a single data point is drawn according to each alternative glyph design, coupled with the ability to page between data points. We demonstrate an implementation of our technique as an extension to Tableau featuring three example palettes, and to better understand how Diatoms could fit into existing design workflows, we conducted interviews and chauffeured demos with 12 designers. Finally, we reflect on our process and the designers' reactions, discussing the potential of our technique in the context of visualization authoring systems. Ultimately, our approach to glyph design and comparison can kickstart and inspire visualization design, allowing for the serendipitous discovery of shape and channel combinations that would have otherwise been overlooked.","article_number":"9552906","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552906","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552906/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552906/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"389","end_page":"399","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":892,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Shape","Tools","Encoding","Media","Authoring systems"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Glyphs","multidimensional data","generative design","communicative visualization","small multiples","qualitative evaluation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Inspiration For The Design","Generation Process","Serendipitous","Serendipity","Visual Design","Semantic Associations","Single Data Point","Combination Of Channels","Exploratory Analysis","Exploratory Data Analysis","Design Tool","Ideal Tool","Categorical Values","Interactive Tool","Source Of Inspiration","Sawtooth","Sawtooth Wave","Symmetric Shape","Asymmetric Shape","Polygonal Shape","Urban Mobility","Drop Shape","Wave Shape","Visual Construction","Visual Metaphors","Visual Hierarchy","Promising Design","Grid Configuration","Gestalt Principles","Gestalt Perception","Gestalt Theory","Gestalt Psychology","Visual Channels","Dense Cities"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114880","title":"Pyramid-based Scatterplots Sampling for Progressive and Streaming Data Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":98,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Shandong University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543204","id":37086543204,"full_name":"Xin Chen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shandong University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"CNIC, CAS, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38026660700","id":38026660700,"full_name":"Jian Zhang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["CNIC, CAS, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37336329800","id":37336329800,"full_name":"Chi-Wing Fu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"]}},{"affiliation":"University Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LISN, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407972900","id":37407972900,"full_name":"Jean-Daniel Fekete","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LISN, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Shandong University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085804605","id":37085804605,"full_name":"Yunhai Wang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shandong University, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present a pyramid-based scatterplot sampling technique to avoid overplotting and enable progressive and streaming visualization of large data.

However, the large number of variables and varying time scales of antecedent conditions contributing to natural phenomena hinder scientists from completing more than the most basic analyses. In this paper, we present EVis (Environmental Visualization), a new visual analytics prototype to help scientists analyze and explore recurring environmental events (e.g. rock fracture, landslides, heat waves, floods) and their relationships with high dimensional time series of continuous numeric environmental variables, such as ambient temperature and precipitation. EVis provides coordinated scatterplots, heatmaps, histograms, and RadViz for foundational analyses. These features allow users to interactively examine relationships between events and one, two, three, or more environmental variables. EVis also provides a novel visual analytics approach to allowing users to discover temporally lagging relationships related to antecedent conditions between events and multiple variables, a critical task in Earth sciences. In particular, this latter approach projects multivariate time series onto trajectories in a 2D space using RadViz, and clusters the trajectories for temporal pattern discovery. Our case studies with rock cracking data and interviews with domain experts from a range of sub-disciplines within Earth sciences illustrate the extensive applicability and usefulness of EVis.","article_number":"9552869","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552869","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552869/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552869/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"912","end_page":"921","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":797,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Time series analysis","Rocks","Earth","Visual analytics","Trajectory","Heating systems","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Multivariate Time Series","RadViz","Event Data","Visual Analytics","Earth Sciences"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Time Series","Time-series","Histogram","Heatmap","Environmental Variables","Basis Of Analysis","Visual Analysis","Natural Phenomena","Natural Phenomenon","Earth Science","Domain Experts","Lithosphere","Earth’s Atmosphere","Earth Atmosphere","2D Space","Visual Approach","Multivariate Time Series","Multivariate Time-series","Univariate Time Series","Fractured Rock","Antecedent Conditions","Hydrosphere","Dimensionality Reduction","Surface Temperature","Top Temperature","Bottom Temperature","Line Chart","Interesting Properties","High Wind Speeds","Around A Circle","Circumference Of A Circle","Perimeter Of A Circle","Dimensional Weight","Weight Of Each Dimension","Event Rate","Negative Temperature","Detailed View"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114798","title":"Exploring the Personal Informatics Analysis Gap: “There's a Lot of Bacon”","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":100,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Computing at the Univeristy of Utah, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088745756","id":37088745756,"full_name":"Jimmy Moore","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computing at the Univeristy of Utah, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Asvito Digital AG., Switzerland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085438672","id":37085438672,"full_name":"Pascal Goffin","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Asvito Digital AG., Switzerland"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computing at the Univeristy of Utah, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089208945","id":37089208945,"full_name":"Jason Wiese","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computing at the Univeristy of Utah, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Science and Technology at Linköping University, School of Computing at the University of Utah, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564728700","id":37564728700,"full_name":"Miriah Meyer","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Science and Technology at Linköping University, School of Computing at the University of Utah, United States"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Personal informatics research helps people track personal data for the purposes of self-reflection and gaining self-knowledge.

This paper contributes a review of personal informatics and visualization research literature to expose a gap in our knowledge for designing flexible tools that assist people engaging with and analyzing personal data in personal contexts, what we call the personal informatics analysis gap.

In many applications, computing distances between diagrams is essential; however, computing these distances has been challenging due to the computational cost. In this paper, we propose a persistence diagram hashing framework that learns a binary code representation of persistence diagrams, which allows for fast computation of distances. This framework is built upon a generative adversarial network (GAN) with a diagram distance loss function to steer the learning process. Instead of using standard representations, we hash diagrams into binary codes, which have natural advantages in large-scale tasks. The training of this model is domain-oblivious in that it can be computed purely from synthetic, randomly created diagrams. As a consequence, our proposed method is directly applicable to various datasets without the need for retraining the model. These binary codes, when compared using fast Hamming distance, better maintain topological similarity properties between datasets than other vectorized representations. To evaluate this method, we apply our framework to the problem of diagram clustering and we compare the quality and performance of our approach to the state-of-the-art. In addition, we show the scalability of our approach on a dataset with 10k persistence diagrams, which is not possible with current techniques. Moreover, our experimental results demonstrate that our method is significantly faster with the potential of less memory usage, while retaining comparable or better quality comparisons.","article_number":"9552880","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552880","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552880/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552880/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"302","end_page":"312","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":393,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Binary codes","Training","Propagation losses","Histograms","Generative adversarial networks","Hash functions","Water resources"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Topological data analysis","Persistence diagrams","Persistence diagram distances","Learned hashing","Clustering"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Topological Space","Loss Function","Loss-of-function","Generative Adversarial Networks","Adversarial Learning","Distance Calculation","Distance Computation","Vector Representation","Similar Topology","Binary Code","Hamming Distance","Standard Representation","Bounding Box","Clustering Results","Similarity Matrix","Similarity Matrices","Hash Function","Hash Table","Hash Value","Hash Codes","Need For Data","Time Of Birth","Binary Matrix","Binary Matrices","Similar Loss","Cancer Datasets","Cancer Data Sets","Optimal Transport","Transportation Problem","Clusters In Dataset","Wasserstein Distance","Wasserstein Metric","Average Number Of Points","Topological Data Analysis","Colorectal Cancer Dataset","Colorectal Cancer Data Set","Bit Length","Bit Lengths","2D Histogram","Topological Clusters","Sublevel Set","Superlevel Sets","Perceptual Loss","Colorectal Cancer"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114841","title":"VizSnippets: Compressing Visualization Bundles Into Representative Previews for Browsing Visualization Collections","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":102,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of British Columbia, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088642005","id":37088642005,"full_name":"Michael Oppermann","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of British Columbia, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"University of British Columbia, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349490300","id":37349490300,"full_name":"Tamara Munzner","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of British Columbia, Canada"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Visualization collections, accessed by platforms such as Tableau Online or Power Bl, are used by millions of people to share and access diverse analytical knowledge in the form of interactive visualization bundles.

Users frequently need to undertake the time-consuming endeavour of opening a bundle within its visualization system to examine its many views and dashboards.

However, objectivity by itself, although crucial, is not sufficient to guarantee that one can identify physically-realizable observers that would perceive or detect the same vortices. Moreover, a significant challenge is that a single reference frame is often not sufficient to accurately observe multiple vortices that follow different motions. This paper presents a novel framework for the exploration and use of an interactively-chosen set of observers, of the resulting relative velocity fields, and of objective vortex structures. We show that our approach facilitates the objective detection and visualization of vortices relative to well-adapted reference frame motions, while at the same time guaranteeing that these observers are in fact physically realizable. In order to represent and manipulate observers efficiently, we make use of the low-dimensional vector space structure of the Lie algebra of physically-realizable observer motions. We illustrate that our framework facilitates the efficient choice and guided exploration of objective vortices in unsteady 2D flow, on planar as well as on spherical domains, using well-adapted reference frames.","article_number":"9556604","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9556604","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9556604/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9556604/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"281","end_page":"290","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":494,"insert_date":"20211001","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Observers","Visualization","Algebra","Interpolation","Optimization","Manifolds","Feature extraction"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Flow visualization","vortex detection","objectivity","observers","reference frames","Lie algebras"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Steady Flow","Unsteady Flow","Interactive Exploration","Reference Frame","Vector Space","Set Of Observations","Lie Algebra","Vortical Structures","Vortex Structures","Spherical Domain","Angular Velocity","Rotational Velocity","Global Optimization","Flow Field","Space Exploration","Space Missions","Vector Field","Supplementary Materials For Details","Rigid Transformation","Rigid Motion","Diffeomorphism","Tangent Space","Covariant Derivative","Interactive Framework","Flow Visualization","Pathlines","Laboratory Frame","Laboratory-frame","Proper Motion","Intrinsic Motion","Killing Vector","Spaced Time Points","Space-time Point","Time-dependent Field","Time Dependent Field","Vortex Core","Input Field","Tangent Plane","North Pole"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114761","title":"F2-Bubbles: Faithful Bubble Set Construction and Flexible Editing","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":104,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Shandong University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085804605","id":37085804605,"full_name":"Yunhai Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shandong University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Shandong University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089205154","id":37089205154,"full_name":"Da Cheng","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shandong University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Shandong University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089205819","id":37089205819,"full_name":"Zhirui Wang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shandong University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"CNIC, CAS, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38026660700","id":38026660700,"full_name":"Jian Zhang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["CNIC, CAS, China"]}},{"affiliation":"National Institute of Health Data Science, Peking University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073908100","id":37073908100,"full_name":"Liang Zhou","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["National Institute of Health Data Science, Peking University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"East China Normal University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37889658900","id":37889658900,"full_name":"Gaoqi He","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["East China Normal University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Konstanz University, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266781000","id":37266781000,"full_name":"Oliver Deussen","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Konstanz University, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this paper, we propose F2-Bubbles, a set overlay visualization technique that addresses overlapping artifacts and supports interactive editing with intelligent suggestions.

A quantitative comparison with state-of-the-art set visualization techniques and case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and suggests that F2-Bubbles is a helpful technique for set visualization.","article_number":"9552179","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552179","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552179/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552179/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"422","end_page":"432","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":599,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Data visualization","Task analysis","Clutter","Approximation algorithms","Tuning","Micromechanical devices"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Set visualization","Edge Crossing","Minimal Spanning Tree"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Bubble Sets","Flexible Editing","Interactive","Direct Use","Direct Utilization","Direct Manipulation","Efficient Construction","Overlay Technique","Energy Values","Time Complexity","Automatic Method","Automatic Methods","Control Points","Set Of Elements","Edge Weights","Hybrid Method","Hybridization Method","Hybrid Methods","Real-world Datasets","Real-world Data Sets","Red Box","Edge Length","Edge Lengths","Field Energy","Set Membership","Spanning Tree","Routing Algorithm","Point Arrays","Hypergraph","Joint Construction","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Minimum Edge","Automatic Construction"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114819","title":"Towards replacing physical testing of granular materials with a Topology-based Model","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":105,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, University of Utah, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089207460","id":37089207460,"full_name":"Aniketh Venkat","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SCI Institute, University of Utah, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, University of Utah, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37870001700","id":37870001700,"full_name":"Attila Gyulassy","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SCI Institute, University of Utah, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089205639","id":37089205639,"full_name":"Graham Kosiba","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089207125","id":37089207125,"full_name":"Amitesh Maiti","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089206632","id":37089206632,"full_name":"Henry Reinstein","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089205359","id":37089205359,"full_name":"Richard Gee","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564112000","id":37564112000,"full_name":"Peer-Timo Bremer","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, University of Utah, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284312600","id":37284312600,"full_name":"Valerio Pascucci","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SCI Institute, University of Utah, United States"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In the study of packed granular materials, the performance of a sample (e.g., the detonation of a high-energy explosive) often correlates to measurements of a fluid flowing through it. The “effective surface area,” the surface area accessible to the airflow, is typically measured using a permeametry apparatus that relates the flow conductance to the permeable surface area via the Carman-Kozeny equation. This equation allows calculating the flow rate of a fluid flowing through the granules packed in the sample for a given pressure drop. However, Carman-Kozeny makes inherent assumptions about tunnel shapes and flow paths that may not accurately hold in situations where the particles possess a wide distribution in shapes, sizes, and aspect ratios, as is true with many powdered systems of technological and commercial interest. To address this challenge, we replicate these measurements virtually on micro-CT images of the powdered material, introducing a new Pore Network Model based on the skeleton of the Morse-Smale complex. Pores are identified as basins of the complex, their incidence encodes adjacency, and the conductivity of the capillary between them is computed from the cross-section at their interface. We build and solve a resistive network to compute an approximate laminar fluid flow through the pore structure. We provide two means of estimating flow-permeable surface area: (i) by direct computation of conductivity, and (ii) by identifying dead-ends in the flow coupled with isosurface extraction and the application of the Carman-Kozeny equation, with the aim of establishing consistency over a range of particle shapes, sizes, porosity levels, and void distribution patterns.","article_number":"9645370","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9645370","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9645370/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9645370/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"76","end_page":"85","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":392,"insert_date":"20211209","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Shape","Mathematical models","Surface treatment","Powders","Computational modeling","Area measurement","Particle measurements"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Physical and Environmental Sciences","Computational Topology-based Techniques","Data Abstractions and Types","Scalar Field Data","Pore Network Model","Morse-Smale Complex"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Granular Material","Topology-based Model","Surface Area","Particle Size","Size Distribution","Porous Structure","Pore Structure","Fluid Flow","Liquid Flow","Fluid Velocity","Aspect Ratio","Laminar Flow","Volume Flow","Volume Flow Rate","Volumetric Flow Rate","Fluid Flow Rate","Flow Intensity","Pressure Drop","Flow Path","micro-CT Images","Resistance Network","Porosity Level","Image Resolution","Critical Point","Cross-sectional Area","Path Length","Path Lengths","Specific Surface Area","Porous Media","Porous Materials","Porous Matrix","Sphere Packing","Sphere-packing","Lattice Packing","Void Space","Pipe Length","Pipe Lengths","Navier Stokes Equations","Navier-Stokes Equations","Total Surface Area","Distance Map","Distance Transform","Distance Field","Mass Conservation","Poiseuille Equation","Hagen-Poiseuille Equation","Hagen-Poiseuille Flow","Hagen Poiseuille Flow","Hagen Poiseuille Equation","Viscous Fluid","Point Flow","Viscous Liquid","Viscous Liquids","Viscous Fluids"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114808","title":"Feature Curves and Surfaces of 3D Asymmetric Tensor Fields","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":106,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087099837","id":37087099837,"full_name":"Shih-Hsuan Hung","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085665492","id":37085665492,"full_name":"Yue Zhang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Civil and Construction Engineering, Oregon State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37889942300","id":37889942300,"full_name":"Harry Yeh","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Civil and Construction Engineering, Oregon State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37398562200","id":37398562200,"full_name":"Eugene Zhang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"3D asymmetric tensor fields have found many applications in science and engineering domains, such as fluid dynamics and solid mechanics. 3D asymmetric tensors can have complex eigenvalues, which makes their analysis and visualization more challenging than 3D symmetric tensors. Existing research in tensor field visualization focuses on 2D asymmetric tensor fields and 3D symmetric tensor fields. In this paper, we address the analysis and visualization of 3D asymmetric tensor fields. We introduce six topological surfaces and one topological curve, which lead to an eigenvalue space based on the tensor mode that we define. In addition, we identify several non-topological feature surfaces that are nonetheless physically important. Included in our analysis are the realizations that triple degenerate tensors are structurally stable and form curves, unlike the case for 3D symmetric tensors fields. Furthermore, there are two different ways of measuring the relative strengths of rotation and angular deformation in the tensor fields, unlike the case for 2D asymmetric tensor fields. We extract these feature surfaces using the A-patches algorithm. However, since three of our feature surfaces are quadratic, we develop a method to extract quadratic surfaces at any given accuracy. To facilitate the analysis of eigenvector fields, we visualize a hyperstreamline as a tree stem with the other two eigenvectors represented as thorns in the real domain or the dual-eigenvectors as leaves in the complex domain. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our analysis and visualization, we apply our approach to datasets from solid mechanics and fluid dynamics.","article_number":"9552927","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552927","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552927/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552927/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"33","end_page":"42","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":621,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Tensors","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Three-dimensional displays","Visualization","Feature extraction","Solids","Topology"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Tensor field visualization","3D asymmetric tensor fields","tensor field topology","traceless tensors","feature surface extraction","degenerate surfaces","neutral surfaces","balanced surfaces","triple degenerate curves"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["3D Field","3D Tensor","Asymmetric Tensor","Field Of Analysis","Fluid Dynamics","Complex Domain","Solid Mechanics","Hardening Mechanism","Curing Mechanism","Symmetric Tensor","Real Domain","Tree Stem","Complex Eigenvalues","Symmetric Field","Angular Deformation","Solid Fluid","Quadratic Surface","Vector Field","Triangular Mesh","Triangle Mesh","Periodic Flow","Flow Period","Field Point","Real Form","Neutral Surface","Real Eigenvalues","Double Cone","Dominant Eigenvalue","Traceless","Tensor Form","Degenerate Points","Symmetric Part","Hyperboloid","Convective Cells"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114811","title":"Learning Objectives, Insights, and Assessments: How Specification Formats Impact Design","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":107,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Michigan, School of Information, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089208600","id":37089208600,"full_name":"Elsie Lee-Robbins","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Michigan, School of Information, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Michigan, School of Information, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085907118","id":37085907118,"full_name":"Shiqing He","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Michigan, School of Information, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Michigan, School of Information, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37331417100","id":37331417100,"full_name":"Eytan Adar","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Michigan, School of Information, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Despite the ubiquity of communicative visualizations, specifying communicative intent during design is ad hoc. Whether we are selecting from a set of visualizations, commissioning someone to produce them, or creating them ourselves, an effective way of specifying intent can help guide this process. Ideally, we would have a concise and shared specification language. In previous work, we have argued that communicative intents can be viewed as a learning/assessment problem (i.e., what should the reader learn and what test should they do well on). Learning-based specification formats are linked (e.g., assessments are derived from objectives) but some may more effectively specify communicative intent. Through a large-scale experiment, we studied three specification types: learning objectives, insights, and assessments. Participants, guided by one of these specifications, rated their preferences for a set of visualization designs. Then, we evaluated the set of visualization designs to assess which specification led participants to prefer the most effective visualizations. We find that while all specification types have benefits over no-specification, each format has its own advantages. Our results show that learning objective-based specifications helped participants the most in visualization selection. We also identify situations in which specifications may be insufficient and assessments are vital.","article_number":"9552876","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552876","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552876/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552876/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"676","end_page":"685","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":441,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Task analysis","Data visualization","Stakeholders","Usability","Taxonomy","Interviews"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Communicative visualization","evaluation","visualization specification"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Learning Objectives","Specific Types","Communication Purposes","Communicative Intentions","Visual Design","Post Hoc Test","Post Hoc Analysis","Design Process","Readability","Multiple-choice Questions","Multiple Choice Questions","Design Choices","Layoffs","Laid-off","Laid Off","Right Size","Main Research Question","Design Decisions","Change In Accuracy","Clear Purpose","Clear Intention","Clear Aim","Multiple Assessments","Long-term Retention","User Testing","Specific Insights","Vipassanā","Vipassana","Communication Goals","Bloom’s Taxonomy","Cognitive Efficiency"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114842","title":"Visualization Equilibrium","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":108,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Northwestern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088655426","id":37088655426,"full_name":"Paula Kayongo","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Los Angeles, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089208465","id":37089208465,"full_name":"Glenn Sun","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Los Angeles, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37551276500","id":37551276500,"full_name":"Jason Hartline","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38016234500","id":38016234500,"full_name":"Jessica Hullman","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In many real-world strategic settings, people use information displays to make decisions.

We contribute the results of a controlled online experiment to examine how the provision and presentation of information impacts people's decisions in a congestion game. Our experiment compares how different visualization approaches for displaying this information, including bar charts and hypothetical outcome plots, and different information conditions, including where the visualized information is private versus public (i.e., available to all agents), affect decision making and welfare. We characterize the effects of visualization anticipation, referring to changes to behavior when an agent goes from alone having access to a visualization to knowing that others also have access to the visualization to guide their decisions. We also empirically identify the visualization equilibrium, i.e., the visualization for which the visualized outcome of agents' decisions matches the realized decisions of the agents who view it.

Compared to linear bar chart, polar (or radial) visualisations have the advantage that cyclical data can be presented continuously without mentally bridging the visual ‘cut’ across the left-and-right boundaries. To investigate this hypothesis and to assess the effect the cut has on analysis performance, this paper presents results from a crowdsourced, controlled experiment with 72 participants comparing new continuous panning technique to linear bar charts (interactive wrapping). Our results show that bar charts with interactive wrapping lead to less errors compared to standard bar charts or polar charts. Inspired by these results, we generalise the concept of interactive wrapping to other visualisations for cyclical or relational data. We describe a design space based on the concept of one-dimensional wrapping and two-dimensional wrapping, linked to two common 3D topologies; cylinder and torus that can be used to metaphorically explain one- and two-dimensional wrapping. This design space suggests that interactive wrapping is widely applicable to many different data types.","article_number":"9552227","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552227","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552227/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552227/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"727","end_page":"736","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":513,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Bars","Data visualization","Wrapping","Task analysis","Topology","Time series analysis","Market research"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Cyclic temporal data","cylindrical topologies","toroidal topologies","interaction techniques","bar charts","polar charts","crowdsourced experiment"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Cylindrical","Cylinder","Bar Charts","Design Space","Radar Chart","Radar Graph","Standard Chart","Time Series","Time-series","Pairwise Comparisons","Greater Than Or Equal","Traffic Accidents","Motor Vehicle Accidents","Car Accident","Spatial Dimensions","Spatial Attributes","Multiple-choice Questions","Multiple Choice Questions","Temporal Data","Visualization Techniques","Pairwise Values","User Preferences","Interactive Visualization","Self-organizing Map","Kohonen","Single Comparisons","Pairwise Group Comparisons","Interaction Techniques","Identification Of Trends","Polar Representation","Type Of Visualization","Sankey Diagram","Sankey Plot","2D Visualization","Temporal Phenomena","Temporal Phenomenon","Time Series Data","Time-series Data","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Bar Height","Height Of Each Bar","Proliferation In Group"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114854","title":"Rapid Labels: Point-Feature Labeling on GPU","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":110,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089206430","id":37089206430,"full_name":"Vaclav Pavlovec","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic"]}},{"affiliation":"Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543101","id":37086543101,"full_name":"Ladislav Cmolik","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Labels, short textual annotations are an important component of data visualizations, illustrations, infographics, and geographical maps. In interactive applications, the labeling method responsible for positioning the labels should not take the resources from the application itself.

In contrast to existing methods that position the labels sequentially, the proposed method positions several labels in parallel. Yet, we guarantee that the positioned labels will not overlap, nor will they overlap important visual features. When the proposed method is searching for the label position of a point-feature, the available label candidates are evaluated with respect to overlaps with important visual features, conflicts with label candidates of other point-features, and their ambiguity. The evaluation of each label candidate is done in constant time independently from the number of point-features, the number of important visual features, and the resolution of the created image. Our measurements indicate that the proposed method is able to position more labels than existing greedy methods that do not evaluate conflicts between the label candidates. At the same time, the proposed method achieves a significant increase in performance. The increase in performance is mainly due to the parallelization and the efficient evaluation of label candidates.","article_number":"9552249","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552249","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552249/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552249/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"604","end_page":"613","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":392,"insert_date":"20210929","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Labeling","Visualization","Layout","Data visualization","Graphics processing units","Annotations","Optimization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Label placement","Point-feature labeling","GPU"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Ambiguity","Parallelization","Parallel Computing","Visual Features","Visual Characteristics","Cartographic","Increase In Performance","Labeling Method","Labeling Methods","Label Positions","Computation Time","Calculation Time","Performance Of Method","Performance Of Methods","Blocking Buffer","Geographic Information System","Sum Of Values","Time Of Method","Time Methods","Simulated Annealing","Output Of Algorithm","Font Size","Small Circle","Number Of Labels","Priority Groups","Zoom Level","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Above-described Method","Above-described Methods","Zoom Factor"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114838","title":"Data-Aware Predictive Scheduling for Distributed-Memory Ray Tracing","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":111,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Texas at Austin, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37072097300","id":37072097300,"full_name":"Hyungman Park","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Texas at Austin, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Texas at Austin, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300594200","id":37300594200,"full_name":"Donald Fussell","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Texas at Austin, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Texas at Austin, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37990427800","id":37990427800,"full_name":"Paul Navrátil","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Texas at Austin, United States"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Scientific ray tracing now can include realistic shading and material properties, but tracing rays of various depths to conclusion through partitioned data is inefficient.

Specifically, we incorporate prediction models capable of dynamically adjusting levels of speculation in ray-data queries, making ray scheduling highly adaptable to a spectrum of scene characteristics. In addition, we organize rays in a tree of speculation nodes, where speculation is coordinated pairwise within a subtree of adaptive ray groups, facilitating concurrency and parallelism.

the organization of IEEE VIS 2021. This marked the first year in which the SciVis, InfoVis, and VAST conferences were merged into a single, unified IEEE VIS. When we began planning for VIS in 2019, we envisioned a great experience for our community, who would be able to enjoy the innovative scientific program provided by a unified VIS, while delighting in the hospitable and lively atmosphere of New Orleans. But even the best laid plans cannot account for all contingencies. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic changed and complicated much in our lives, including the planning for VIS 2021. Moreover, transition to a unified conference was not without its challenges as well. Despite the difficulties, our community showed, once again, its strength and resilience. Our organizing committee created an exciting conference with a rich program full of high-quality research with all challenges being continuously and admirably addressed. As general chairs, our primary responsibility was to watch these wonderful volunteers conduct truly inspiring work under extreme constraints. For this, we are deeply indebted.","article_number":"9663063","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9663063","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9663063/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9663063/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"xiii","end_page":"xiii","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":282,"insert_date":"20211224","index_terms":{}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114900","title":"IEEE Visualization and Graphics Technical Committee (VGTC): http://vgtc.org/","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":118,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Presents a listing of the IEEE Visualization and Graphics Technical Committee.","article_number":"9663069","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9663069","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9663069/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9663069/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"xxiv","end_page":"xxiv","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":234,"insert_date":"20211224","index_terms":{}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114914","title":"Message from the Editor-in-Chief","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":119,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273119700","id":37273119700,"full_name":"Klaus Mueller","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Stony Brook University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Welcome to the January 2022 issue of the IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG).

There is no more IEEE VAST, IEEE InfoVis and IEEE SciVis; there is just IEEE VIS, tiled into six overarching areas: Applications (24 papers), Analytics & Decisions (19), Theoretical & Empirical (24), Representations & Interaction (19), Data Transformations (14) and Systems & Rendering (11). The conference was scheduled to take place in New Orleans (LA) but was moved to a virtual event due to the global coronavirus pandemic. This virtual conference took place from October 24-29, 2021. Contained in this special issue are the top 110 papers selected by the unified program committee from a total of 441 submissions. In addition, this issue also contains the Best Paper of the 2021 IEEE Large Scale Data Analysis and Visualization (LDAV) Symposium and the Best Paper of the 2021 IEEE Symposium on Visualization for Cyber Security (VizSec).","article_number":"9663062","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9663062","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9663062/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9663062/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"xii","end_page":"xii","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":301,"insert_date":"20211224","index_terms":{}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114935","title":"VIS 2021 Best Papers Committee","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":120,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Presents a listing of the VIS 2021 Best Papers Committee.","article_number":"9663070","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9663070","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9663070/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9663070/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":9663056,"publication_year":2022,"publication_date":"Jan. 2022","start_page":"xli","end_page":"xliii","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":197,"insert_date":"20211224","index_terms":{}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114891","title":"Preface","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":121,"volume":"28","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37293389400","id":37293389400,"full_name":"Bongshin Lee","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien), Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282584500","id":37282584500,"full_name":"Silvia Miksch","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien), Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Linköping University, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284192000","id":37284192000,"full_name":"Anders Ynnerman","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Linköping University, Sweden"]}},{"affiliation":"Univ.
