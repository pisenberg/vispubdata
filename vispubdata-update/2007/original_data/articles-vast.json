Most people get only glimpses of what we do, and those glimpses rarely tell the story clearly. Think about the view of InfoVis that has been created in 2007 through marketing, blogs, and articles. This view is peppered with misperception. In this presentation, I'll take you on a tour of InfoVis' exposure in 2007: the highlights and the failures that have shaped the world's perception of our beloved and important work. The world needs what we do, but this need remains largely unsatisfied.","article_number":"4388989","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4388989","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4388989/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4388989/","publication_title":"2007 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Sacramento, CA, USA","conference_dates":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","publication_number":4388976,"is_number":4388977,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","start_page":"x","end_page":"x","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":183,"insert_date":"20071127","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Blogs","Books","Computer science","Education","Writing","Visual communication","Data analysis"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1659-2","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2007.4389032","title":"VAST 2007 Contest - Blue Iguanodon","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-1659-2","partnum":"07EX2042","rank":2,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Massachusetts, Lowell, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37360588500","id":37360588500,"full_name":"Georges Grinstein","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Massachusetts, Lowell, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"National Institute for Standards and Technology, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283026800","id":37283026800,"full_name":"Catherine Plaisant","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["National Institute for Standards and Technology, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"National Institute for Standards and Technology, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37837224000","id":37837224000,"full_name":"Sharon Laskowski","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["National Institute for Standards and Technology, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37948663500","id":37948663500,"full_name":"Theresa O'Connell","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268671300","id":37268671300,"full_name":"Jean Scholtz","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37357067600","id":37357067600,"full_name":"Mark Whiting","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Visual analytics experts realize that one effective way to push the field forward and to develop metrics for measuring the performance of various visual analytics components is to hold an annual competition.

And unlike most dynamic social network visualization tools, which focus on the addition and deletion of nodes (actors) and edges (relationships) over time, C-GROUP focuses on changing group memberships over time. C-GROUP provides users with a flexible interface for defining (and redefining) groups interactively, and allows users to view the changing group memberships for the pair over time. This helps to highlight the similarities and differences between the individuals and their evolving group memberships. C-GROUP allows users to dynamically select the time granularity of the temporal evolution and supports two novel visual representations of the evolving group memberships.

Sunfall utilizes novel interactive visualization and analysis techniques to facilitate deeper scientific insight into complex, noisy, high-dimensional, high-volume, time-critical data. The system combines novel image processing algorithms, statistical analysis, and machine learning with highly interactive visual interfaces to enable collaborative, user-driven scientific exploration of supernova image and spectral data.

But even though formal models and classification rules may not exist in these data exploration scenarios, domain scientists and experts generally have a vast amount of non-compiled knowledge and intuition that they can bring to bear in this effort. In CA, there are various popular mechanisms to generate the clusters, however, the results from their non-supervised deployment rarely fully agree with this expert knowledge and intuition. To this end, our paper describes a comprehensive and intuitive framework to aid scientists in the derivation of classification hierarchies in CA, using k-means as the overall clustering engine, but allowing them to tune its parameters interactively based on a non-distorted compact visual presentation of the inherent characteristics of the data in high-dimensional space. These include cluster geometry, composition, spatial relations to neighbors, and others. In essence, we provide all the tools necessary for a high-dimensional activity we call cluster sculpting, and the evolving hierarchy can then be viewed in a space-efficient radial dendrogram. We demonstrate our system in the context of the mining and classification of a large collection of millions of data items of aerosol mass spectra, but our framework readily applies to any high-dimensional CA scenario.","article_number":"4388999","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4388999","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4388999/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4388999/","publication_title":"2007 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Sacramento, CA, USA","conference_dates":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","publication_number":4388976,"is_number":4388977,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","start_page":"75","end_page":"82","citing_paper_count":47,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":712,"insert_date":"20071127","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Couplings","Analysis of variance","Shape measurement","Data mining","Displays","Clustering algorithms","Visualization","Space exploration","Iterative methods"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analytics","High-Dimensional Data","Visual Data Mining","Visualization in Earth","Space and Environmental Sciences"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1659-2","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2007.4388992","title":"Stories in GeoTime","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-1659-2","partnum":"07EX2042","rank":29,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Oculus Info, Inc., USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37425695700","id":37425695700,"full_name":"Ryan Eccles","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oculus Info, Inc., USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Oculus Info, Inc., USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37704437500","id":37704437500,"full_name":"Thomas Kapler","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oculus Info, Inc., USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Oculus Info, Inc., USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37594531000","id":37594531000,"full_name":"Robert Harper","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oculus Info, Inc., USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Oculus Info, Inc., USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37654961400","id":37654961400,"full_name":"William Wright","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oculus Info, Inc., USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"A story is a powerful abstraction used by intelligence analysts to conceptualize threats and understand patterns as part of the analytical process.

Though most research to date assumes a single-user focus on perceptual and cognitive processes, in practice, sensemaking is often a social process involving parallelization of effort, discussion, and consensus building. This suggests that to fully support sensemaking, interactive visualization should also support social interaction.

In this article, we present design considerations for asynchronous collaboration in visual analysis environments, highlighting issues of work parallelization, communication, and social organization.

In this paper we describe a model for identifying patterns of conflicts in Wikipedia articles. The model relies on users' editing history and the relationships between user edits, especially revisions that void previous edits, known as \"reverts\". Based on this model, we constructed Revert Graph, a tool that visualizes the overall conflict patterns between groups of users.

The idea of IVQuery is to interactively select focus areas in the visualization. Then, according to the characteristics of the selected areas, such as the data dimensions and records, IVQuery employs analytical methods to identify the relationships to other portions of the data set. Finally, IVQuery generates visual representations for analysts to view and refine the results. IVQuery has been applied successfully to different real-world data sets, such as data warehouse performance, product sales, and sever performance analysis, and demonstrates the benefits of this technique over traditional filtering and zooming techniques. The visual analytics query technique can be used with many different types of visual representation.

They tend not to provide integrated analytical services that could aid users in tackling complex knowledge discovery tasks. Users' exploration in such environments is usually impeded due to several problems: 1) valuable information is hard to discover when too much data is visualized on the screen; 2) Users have to manage and organize their discoveries off line, because no systematic discovery management mechanism exists; 3) their discoveries based on visual exploration alone may lack accuracy; 4) and they have no convenient access to the important knowledge learned by other users. To tackle these problems, it has been recognized that analytical tools must be introduced into visualization systems. In this paper, we present a novel analysis-guided exploration system, called the Nugget Management System (NMS). It leverages the collaborative effort of human comprehensibility and machine computations to facilitate users' visual exploration processes. Specifically, NMS first extracts the valuable information (nuggets) hidden in datasets based on the interests of users. Given that similar nuggets may be re-discovered by different users, NMS consolidates the nugget candidate set by clustering based on their semantic similarity. To solve the problem of inaccurate discoveries, localized data mining techniques are applied to refine the nuggets to best represent the captured patterns in datasets. Lastly, the resulting well-organized nugget pool is used to guide users' exploration. To evaluate the effectiveness of NMS, we integrated NMS into XmdvTool, a freeware multivariate visualization system.","article_number":"4389000","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4389000","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4389000/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4389000/","publication_title":"2007 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Sacramento, CA, USA","conference_dates":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","publication_number":4388976,"is_number":4388977,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","start_page":"83","end_page":"90","citing_paper_count":20,"citing_patent_count":4,"download_count":418,"insert_date":"20071127","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Knowledge management","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Humans","Information analysis","Environmental management","Data mining","Visual databases","Displays","Impedance"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analytics","Visual Knowledge Discovery","Discovery Management","Analysis Guided Exploration"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1659-2","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2007.4388993","title":"LAHVA: Linked Animal-Human Health Visual Analytics","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-1659-2","partnum":"07EX2042","rank":39,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396008400","id":37396008400,"full_name":"Ross Maciejewski","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088624464","id":37088624464,"full_name":"Benjamin Tyner","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37557344300","id":37557344300,"full_name":"Yun Jang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088624564","id":37088624564,"full_name":"Cheng Zheng","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37397099000","id":37397099000,"full_name":"Rimma V.

This monitoring requires the integration and analysis of multi-field, multi-scale and multi-source data sets. In order to better understand these data sets, models and measurements at different resolutions must be analyzed. To facilitate these investigations, we have created an application to provide a visual analytics framework for analyzing both human emergency room data and veterinary hospital data. Our integrated visual analytic tool links temporally varying geospatial visualization of animal and human patient health information with advanced statistical analysis of these multi-source data. Various statistical analysis techniques have been applied in conjunction with a spatio-temporal viewing window. Such an application provides researchers with the ability to visually search the data for clusters in both a statistical model view and a spatio-temporal view. Our interface provides a factor specification/filtering component to allow exploration of causal factors and spread patterns. In this paper, we will discuss the application of our linked animal-human visual analytics (LAHVA) tool to two specific case studies. The first case study is the effect of seasonal influenza and its correlation with different companion animals (e.g., cats, dogs) syndromes. Here we use data from the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC) and Banfield Pet Hospitals in an attempt to determine if there are correlations between respiratory syndromes representing the onset of seasonal influenza in humans and general respiratory syndromes in cats and dogs. Our second case study examines the effect of the release of industrial wastewater in a community through companion animal surveillance.","article_number":"4388993","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4388993","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4388993/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4388993/","publication_title":"2007 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Sacramento, CA, USA","conference_dates":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","publication_number":4388976,"is_number":4388977,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","start_page":"27","end_page":"34","citing_paper_count":17,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":446,"insert_date":"20071127","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Humans","Animals","Monitoring","Hospitals","Statistical analysis","Influenza","Cats","Dogs","Alarm systems"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1659-2","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2007.4388996","title":"Thin Client Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-1659-2","partnum":"07EX2042","rank":40,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"SSS Research, Inc., Naperville, IL, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282570100","id":37282570100,"full_name":"Stephen G.

A central component of the architecture is an entity extractor that extracts named entities like person names, location names, temporal references, etc. FEMARepViz is based on FactXtractor, an entity-extractor that works on text documents.

Traditional data management and interactive retrieval approaches have often focused on solving the data overload problem at the expense of the user's SA. This paper discusses various data management strategies and the strengths and limitations of each approach in providing the user with SA. A new data management strategy, coined Smart Aggregation, is presented as a powerful approach to overcome the challenges of both massive data sets and maintaining SA. By combining automatic data aggregation with user-defined controls on what, how, and when data should be aggregated, we present a visualization system that can handle massive amounts of data while affording the user with the best possible SA. This approach ensures that a system is always usable in terms of both system resources and human perceptual resources. We have implemented our Smart Aggregation approach in a visual analytics system called VIAssist (Visual Assistant for Information Assurance Analysis) to facilitate exploration, discovery, and SA in the domain of Information Assurance.","article_number":"4388998","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4388998","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4388998/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4388998/","publication_title":"2007 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Sacramento, CA, USA","conference_dates":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","publication_number":4388976,"is_number":4388977,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","start_page":"67","end_page":"74","citing_paper_count":11,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":271,"insert_date":"20071127","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Human resource management","Information retrieval","Data visualization","Energy management","Displays","Information analysis","Technology management","Databases","Automation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data management","visual analytics","data retrieval","information visualization","smart aggregation","situational awareness"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1659-2","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2007.4388990","title":"Activity Analysis Using Spatio-Temporal Trajectory Volumes in Surveillance Applications","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-1659-2","partnum":"07EX2042","rank":45,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294440400","id":37294440400,"full_name":"Firdaus Janoos","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37966484200","id":37966484200,"full_name":"Shantanu Singh","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37827945300","id":37827945300,"full_name":"Okan Irfanoglu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37269516700","id":37269516700,"full_name":"Raghu Machiraju","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37324916700","id":37324916700,"full_name":"Richard Parent","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"In this paper, we present a system to analyze activities and detect anomalies in a surveillance application, which exploits the intuition and experience of security and surveillance experts through an easy- to-use visual feedback loop.

The system learns the fundamental descriptions of the behavior patterns in a semi-supervised fashion by the higher order singular value decomposition of the space described by the training data. This training process is guided and refined by the users in an intuitive fashion. Anomalies are detected by projecting the test data into this multi-linear space and are visualized by the system to direct the attention of the user to potential problem spots.

A remarkable property of some Wikipedia pages is that they are written by up to thousands of authors who may have contradicting opinions. In this paper we show that a visual analysis of the \"who revises whom\"- network gives deep insight into controversies. We propose a set of analysis and visualization techniques that reveal the dominant authors of a page, the roles they play, and the alters they confront. Thereby we provide tools to understand how Wikipedia authors collaborate in the presence of controversy.","article_number":"4389012","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4389012","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4389012/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4389012/","publication_title":"2007 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Sacramento, CA, USA","conference_dates":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","publication_number":4388976,"is_number":4388977,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","start_page":"179","end_page":"186","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":165,"insert_date":"20071127","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Encyclopedias","Wikipedia","History","Collaboration","Visualization","Information analysis","Information science","Internet","Collaborative tools","Social network services"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Wikipedia","social network analysis","controversy"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1659-2","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2007.4388995","title":"Visual Analytics Approach to User-Controlled Evacuation Scheduling","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-1659-2","partnum":"07EX2042","rank":47,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer Institute of Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS), Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047100","id":37283047100,"full_name":"Gennady Andrienko","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute of Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS), Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer Institute of Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS), Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047700","id":37283047700,"full_name":"Natalia Andrienko","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute of Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS), Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer Institute of Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS), Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945217400","id":37945217400,"full_name":"Ulrich Bartling","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute of Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS), Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Application of the ideas of visual analytics is a promising approach to supporting decision making, in particular, where the problems have geographic (or spatial) and temporal aspects. Visual analytics may be especially helpful in time-critical applications, which pose hard challenges to decision support. We have designed a suite of tools to support transportation-planning tasks such as emergency evacuation of people from a disaster- affected area. The suite combines a tool for automated scheduling based on a genetic algorithm with visual analytics techniques allowing the user to evaluate tool results and direct its work. A transportation schedule, which is generated by the tool, is a complex construct involving geographical space, time, and heterogeneous objects (people and vehicles) with states and positions varying in time. We apply task-analytical approach to design techniques that could effectively support a human planner in the analysis of this complex information H. 1.2 [User/Machine Systems]: Human information processing - Visual Analytics; 1.6.9 [Visualization]: information visualization.","article_number":"4388995","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4388995","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4388995/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4388995/","publication_title":"2007 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Sacramento, CA, USA","conference_dates":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","publication_number":4388976,"is_number":4388977,"publication_year":2007,"publication_date":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","start_page":"43","end_page":"50","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":287,"insert_date":"20071127","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Humans","Visualization","Decision making","Time factors","Genetic algorithms","Transportation","Space vehicles","Information analysis","Information processing"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Geovisualization","transportation planning","vehicle scheduling","task-centered design","coordinated multiple views"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1659-2","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2007.4388997","title":"IMAS: The Interactive Multigenomic Analysis System","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-1659-2","partnum":"07EX2042","rank":48,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Interactive Arts & Technology, Simon Fraser University Surrey, Surrey, BC, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37358198200","id":37358198200,"full_name":"Christopher D.

The user may analyze the sequence in a number of ways, and visualize these analyses in a coherent, sequence aligned form, with all related analysis products grouped together. This enables the user to rapidly perform analyses of DNA sequences without the need for tedious and error-prone cutting and pasting of sequence data from text files to and from web-based databases and
