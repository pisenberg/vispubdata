By taking the wind data into consideration, as well, our approach allows the retrieval of patterns in the chemical releases and identify key polluters.","article_number":"8585436","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8585436","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585436/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585436/","publication_title":"2017 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","conference_dates":"3-6 Oct. 2017","publication_number":8574342,"is_number":8585424,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"3-6 Oct. 2017","start_page":"225","end_page":"226","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":35,"insert_date":"20181223","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Chemicals","Monitoring","Companies","Wind speed","Visualization","Task analysis","Time series analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Patterns In Data","Nature Reserve","Wildlife Refuge","Wildlife Sanctuaries","Chemical Release","Time Series","Missing Values","Wind Direction"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3164-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3163-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2017.8585615","title":"MC2 — Spatio-Temporal Provenance Data Aggregation for Visual Analysis","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5386-3164-5","rank":9,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085338700","id":37085338700,"full_name":"Rainer Splechtna","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086554776","id":37086554776,"full_name":"Silvana Podaras","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073197900","id":37073197900,"full_name":"Michael Beham","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37323697500","id":37323697500,"full_name":"Denis Gračanin","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37947312900","id":37947312900,"full_name":"Krešimir Matković","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"We describe our approach to the analysis of 2017 VAST Challenge Mini-Challenge 2 data.

The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Combustion and turbulence simulations involve highly intermittent localized phenomena that generate high volumes of spatially and temporally varying field and particle data. The current paradigm of posthoc analysis and visualization will become increasingly infeasible as data volumes continue to increase. In the exascale era this problem will be further exacerbated by the difficulty of moving large volumes of data through deep complex memory hierarchies and across the machine network to hard disks on a heterogeneous supercomputer. I will discuss recent advances in in situ massively parallel volume and particle visualization algorithms coupled with analytics - e.g., topological feature segmentation/tracking, distance field construction, multi-variate statistics and eigensolutions of the reaction rate Jacobian - as an integral part of a scientific discovery from high-fidelity combustion simulations. The role of asynchronous task based programming models and runtimes to facilitate an extensible, performance portable computational science workflow at extreme scale will also be discussed in the context of recent turbulent ignition simulations.","article_number":"8585481","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8585481","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585481/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585481/","publication_title":"2017 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","conference_dates":"3-6 Oct. 2017","publication_number":8574342,"is_number":8585424,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"3-6 Oct. 2017","start_page":"1","end_page":"1","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":793,"insert_date":"20181223","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Combustion","Computational modeling","Mathematical models","Data models","Analytical models","Laboratories","Uncertainty"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3164-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3163-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2017.8585548","title":"Temporal Pattern Analysis and Source Detection through Visual Analysis on Multi-Dimensional Time Series Data","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5386-3164-5","rank":13,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086553994","id":37086553994,"full_name":"Ruike Jiang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University"]}},{"affiliation":"QIHOO 360","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085387861","id":37085387861,"full_name":"Wei Huang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["QIHOO 360"]}},{"affiliation":"Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086562001","id":37086562001,"full_name":"Nan Ma","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University"]}},{"affiliation":"Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085503743","id":37085503743,"full_name":"Fan Hong","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085336513","id":37085336513,"full_name":"Ying Zhao","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University"]}},{"affiliation":"Beijing Engineering Technology Research Center of Virtual Simulation and Visualization, Peking University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403856700","id":37403856700,"full_name":"Xiaoru Yuan","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Beijing Engineering Technology Research Center of Virtual Simulation and Visualization, Peking University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"In VAST Challenge 2017, we developed a visual exploration system for detection of sensor anomaly, pattern of chemical distribution and responsible factory for each release of chemical.

Anomalies in vehicle traffic patterns are linked to proximal factory emissions, and further associated with satellite imagery that show proof of degradation in plant quality in the preserve. The evidences are supported with visualizations created in Tableau, R, QGIS & SAS-JMP.

However, low resolution of the satellite images, and a lack of information of human activity and geological information makes it difficult to find and understand all temporal changes. We present an approach to analyze the change over time using satellite images of a natural preserve. We create a map, which contains all changes between two time steps, by using frame differencing. We then exclude uninteresting natural phenomena like clouds. The resulting map is than used to find all changes. Each of the changes is then analyzed in detail by using state of the art algorithm like false-colored images and ratio transformations.","article_number":"8585476","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8585476","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585476/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585476/","publication_title":"2017 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","conference_dates":"3-6 Oct. 2017","publication_number":8574342,"is_number":8585424,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"3-6 Oct. 2017","start_page":"231","end_page":"232","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":34,"insert_date":"20181223","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Satellites","Cloud computing","Shape","Image color analysis","Vegetation mapping","Indexes","Image resolution"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["I.3.8 [Computing Methodologies]: Computer Graphics—Applications","I.4.8 [Image Processing and Computer Vision]: Scene Analysis—Time-varying imagery"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Satellite Images","Nature Reserve","Wildlife Refuge","Wildlife Sanctuaries","Frame Difference","Human Activities","Natural Phenomena","Natural Phenomenon","Multispectral Images","Multispectral Imagery","Low-resolution Images","Vegetation Index","Vegetation Indices","Normalized Difference Vegetation Index","NDVI","Shortwave Infrared"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3164-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3163-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2017.8585482","title":"Multi-Spectral Satellite Image Analysis for Feature Identification and Change Detection VAST Challenge 2017: Honorable Mention for Good Facilitation of Single Image Analysis","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5386-3164-5","rank":32,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086152142","id":37086152142,"full_name":"Sulav Malla","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086560522","id":37086560522,"full_name":"Anwesh Tuladhar","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086556695","id":37086556695,"full_name":"Ghulam Jilani Quadri","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37398611400","id":37398611400,"full_name":"Paul Rosen","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Satellite images are helpful in remote sensing of land features.

This enabled the correct prediction and elimination of pollution sources at a precision far in excess of the spatial density of the sensors themselves.","article_number":"8585588","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8585588","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585588/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585588/","publication_title":"2017 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","conference_dates":"3-6 Oct. 2017","publication_number":8574342,"is_number":8585424,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"3-6 Oct. 2017","start_page":"201","end_page":"202","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":87,"insert_date":"20181223","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Sensors","Chemical sensors","Pollution","Chemicals","Visual analytics","Probabilistic logic","Uncertainty"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Pollution Sources","Airborne Pollutants","Vast Challenges","Sensor Data","Geographic Information System","Multiple Events","Event Detection","Sensor Networks","Wind Direction","Industrial Sites","Temporal Precision"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3164-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3163-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2017.8585667","title":"Detecting Vehicular Patterns Using a Graph-Based Approach","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5386-3164-5","rank":36,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085640360","id":37085640360,"full_name":"Sirisha Velampalli","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University"]}},{"affiliation":"Tennessee Tech University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085525443","id":37085525443,"full_name":"Lenin Mookiah","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tennessee Tech University"]}},{"affiliation":"Tennessee Tech University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37573606300","id":37573606300,"full_name":"William Eberle","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tennessee Tech University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"In the VAST 2017 competition, one of the challenges is to discover vehicular traffic patterns for understanding the reasons behind a decrease in the number of nesting pairs of Rose-Crested Blue Pipit.

The approach leverages “instance-level explanations”, measures of local feature relevance that explain single instances, and uses them to build a set of visual representations that guide the users in their investigation. The workflow is based on three main visual representations and steps: one based on aggregate statistics to see how data distributes across correct / incorrect decisions; one based on explanations to understand which features are used to make these decisions; and one based on raw data, to derive insights on potential root causes for the observed patterns. The workflow is derived from a long-term collaboration with a group of machine learning and healthcare professionals who used our method to make sense of machine learning models they developed.

In this paper, we present a novel, systematic study and resulting analyses that investigate the effects of anchoring effect on human decision-making using visual analytic systems. Visual analytics interfaces typically contain multiple views that present various aspects of information such as spatial, temporal, and categorical. These views are designed to present complex, heterogeneous data in accessible forms that aid decision-making. However, human decision-making is often hindered by the use of heuristics, or cognitive biases, such as anchoring effect. Anchoring effect can be triggered by the order in which information is presented or the magnitude of information presented. Through carefully designed laboratory experiments, we present evidence of anchoring effect in analysis with visual analytics interfaces when users are primed by representation of different pieces of information. We also describe detailed analyses of users’ interaction logs which reveal the impact of anchoring bias on the visual representation preferred and paths of analysis. We discuss implications for future research to possibly detect and alleviate anchoring bias.","article_number":"8585665","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8585665","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585665/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585665/","publication_title":"2017 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","conference_dates":"3-6 Oct. 2017","publication_number":8574342,"is_number":8585424,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"3-6 Oct. 2017","start_page":"116","end_page":"126","citing_paper_count":43,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":3107,"insert_date":"20181223","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Decision making","Visual analytics","Analytical models","Task analysis","Data visualization","Uncertainty"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analytics","Anchoring Effect","Sense Making","Cognitive Bias","Interaction Log Analysis","K.6.1 [Management of Computing and Information Systems]: Project and People Management-Life Cycle","K.7.m [The Computing Profession]: Miscellaneous-Ethics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Anchoring Effect","Focusing Effect","Anchoring Bias","Effect Of Focus","Focal Events","Focusing Events","Visual System","Cognitive Biases","Human Decision-making","Human Decision Makers","Use Of Heuristics","Different Pieces Of Information","Interactive","Decision-making Process","Decision Process","Interaction Patterns","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Cloud Data","Word Cloud","Proportion Of Subjects","Complex Datasets","Topic Modeling","PageRank","Supplementary Results","Proportion Of Users","Decision-making Task","Sequential Interactions","Map View","Visual Interface","Decision-making Outcomes","Decision-making Results","Training Videos","Top Nodes","List Of Events","Specific View","Magnetic Effect","Attraction Effect","Logistics","Community Detection"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3164-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3163-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2017.8585498","title":"The Role of Explicit Knowledge: A Conceptual Model of Knowledge-Assisted Visual Analytics","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5386-3164-5","rank":42,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"TU Wien, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37569322900","id":37569322900,"full_name":"Paolo Federico","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Wien, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"St. Poelten University of Applied Sciences, Austria and TU Wien, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085865698","id":37085865698,"full_name":"Markus Wagner","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["St. Poelten University of Applied Sciences, Austria and TU Wien, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"St. Poelten University of Applied Sciences, Austria and TU Wien, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077207200","id":37077207200,"full_name":"Alexander Rind","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["St. Poelten University of Applied Sciences, Austria and TU Wien, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Wien, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085361518","id":37085361518,"full_name":"Albert Amor-Amorós","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Wien, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Wien, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282584500","id":37282584500,"full_name":"Silvia Miksch","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Wien, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Wien, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267339500","id":37267339500,"full_name":"Wolfgang Aigner","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Wien, Austria"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Visual Analytics (VA) aims to combine the strengths of humans and computers for effective data analysis. In this endeavor, humans' tacit knowledge from prior experience is an important asset that can be leveraged by both human and computer to improve the analytic process. While VA environments are starting to include features to formalize, store, and utilize such knowledge, the mechanisms and degree in which these environments integrate explicit knowledge varies widely. Additionally, this important class of VA environments has never been elaborated on by existing work on VA theory. This paper proposes a conceptual model of Knowledge-assisted VA conceptually grounded on the visualization model by van Wijk. We apply the model to describe various examples of knowledge-assisted VA from the literature and elaborate on three of them in finer detail. Moreover, we illustrate the utilization of the model to compare different design alternatives and to evaluate existing approaches with respect to their use of knowledge. Finally, the model can inspire designers to generate novel VA environments using explicit knowledge effectively.","article_number":"8585498","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8585498","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585498/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585498/","publication_title":"2017 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","conference_dates":"3-6 Oct. 2017","publication_number":8574342,"is_number":8585424,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"3-6 Oct. 2017","start_page":"92","end_page":"103","citing_paper_count":33,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":901,"insert_date":"20181223","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Data analysis","Cognition","Knowledge based systems","Data models","Visual analytics","Analytical models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Automated analysis","tacit knowledge","explicit knowledge","visual analytics","information visualization","theory and model"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Role Of Knowledge","Role In Cognition","Explicit Knowledge","Use Of Knowledge","Tacit Knowledge","Implicit Knowledge","Embodied Knowledge","Visual Model","Van Wijk","Cognitive Processes","Mental Processes","Knowledge Base","Cognitive Domains","Domain Knowledge","General Knowledge","General Cognition","Forms Of Knowledge","Knowledge Information","Human Cognition","Human Knowledge","Knowledge Integration","Interactive Visualization","Ground Reaction Force","Procedural Knowledge","Interactive Exploration","Perception Of Space","Knowledge Extraction","Knowledge Database","Declarative Knowledge","Computational Space","Calculation Space","Operational Knowledge","Internal Knowledge","Human Side","Visual Encoding","Knowledge Gain","Knowledge Discovery","Raw Data","Domain Ontology","Domain-specific Ontologies"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3164-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3163-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2017.8585647","title":"Visual Causality Analysis Made Practical","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5386-3164-5","rank":43,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Visual Analytics and Imaging Lab, Stony Brook University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085621793","id":37085621793,"full_name":"Jun Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Analytics and Imaging Lab, Stony Brook University"]}},{"affiliation":"Visual Analytics and Imaging Lab, Stony Brook University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273119700","id":37273119700,"full_name":"Klaus Mueller","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Analytics and Imaging Lab, Stony Brook University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Deriving the exact casual model that governs the relations between variables in a multidimensional dataset is difficult in practice. It is because causal inference algorithms by themselves typically cannot encode an adequate amount of domain knowledge to break all ties. Visual analytic approaches are considered a feasible alternative to fully automated methods. However, their application in real-world scenarios can be tedious. This paper focuses on these practical aspects of visual causality analysis. The most imperative of these aspects is posed by Simpson' Paradox. It implies the existence of multiple causal models differing in both structure and parameter depending on how the data is subdivided. We propose a comprehensive interface that engages human experts in identifying these subdivisions and allowing them to establish the corresponding causal models via a rich set of interactive facilities. Other features of our interface include: (1) a new causal network visualization that emphasizes the flow of causal dependencies, (2) a model scoring mechanism with visual hints for interactive model refinement, and (3) flexible approaches for handling heterogeneous data. Various real-world data examples are given.","article_number":"8585647","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8585647","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585647/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585647/","publication_title":"2017 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","conference_dates":"3-6 Oct. 2017","publication_number":8574342,"is_number":8585424,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"3-6 Oct. 2017","start_page":"151","end_page":"161","citing_paper_count":29,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":687,"insert_date":"20181223","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Analytical models","Data models","Data visualization","Visual analytics","Inference algorithms","Correlation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual knowledge discovery","Causality","Hypothesis testing","Visual evidence","High-dimensional data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Causal Analysis","Causal Inference","Real-world Data","Variance In The Dataset","Real-world Scenarios","Causal Model","Inference Algorithm","Causal Network","Logistic Regression","Causal Relationship","Bayesian Model","Bayesian Approach","Bayesian Network","Bayesian Information Criterion","Bayesian Information Criteria","Model Group","Numerical Variables","Number Of Data Points","Global Map","Data Partitioning","Directed Acyclic Graph","Causal Structure","Parallel Coordinates","Causal Patterns","First-year University","First Year Of College","Causal Graph","Path Diagram","Credible Models","Incoming Edges","Causal Path","Bayesian Information Criterion Score","Directed Graph","Directed Edge"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3164-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3163-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2017.8585638","title":"E-Map: A Visual Analytics Approach for Exploring Significant Event Evolutions in Social Media","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5386-3164-5","rank":44,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education) and School of EECS, Peking University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085387892","id":37085387892,"full_name":"Siming Chen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education) and School of EECS, Peking University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education) and School of EECS, Peking University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086146756","id":37086146756,"full_name":"Shuai Chen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education) and School of EECS, Peking University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education) and School of EECS, Peking University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086558503","id":37086558503,"full_name":"Lijing Lin","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education) and School of EECS, Peking University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education) and School of EECS, Peking University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403856700","id":37403856700,"full_name":"Xiaoru Yuan","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education) and School of EECS, Peking University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Faculty of Engineer and Information Technology, The University of Technology, Sydney, Australia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085343774","id":37085343774,"full_name":"Jie Liang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Faculty of Engineer and Information Technology, The University of Technology, Sydney, Australia"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Information Sciences and Technology, Pennsylvania State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547462","id":37086547462,"full_name":"Xiaolong Zhang","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Information Sciences and Technology, Pennsylvania State University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Significant events are often discussed and spread through social media, involving many people. Reposting activities and opinions expressed in social media offer good opportunities to understand the evolution of events. However, the dynamics of reposting activities and the diversity of user comments pose challenges to understand event-related social media data. We propose E-Map, a visual analytics approach that uses map-like visualization tools to help multi-faceted analysis of social media data on a significant event and in-depth understanding of the development of the event. E-Map transforms extracted keywords, messages, and reposting behaviors into map features such as cities, towns, and rivers to build a structured and semantic space for users to explore. It also visualizes complex posting and reposting behaviors as simple trajectories and connections that can be easily followed. By supporting multi-level spatial temporal exploration, E-Map helps to reveal the patterns of event development and key players in an event, disclosing the ways they shape and affect the development of the event. Two cases analysing real-world events confirm the capacities of E-Map in facilitating the analysis of event evolution with social media data.","article_number":"8585638","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8585638","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585638/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585638/","publication_title":"2017 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","conference_dates":"3-6 Oct. 2017","publication_number":8574342,"is_number":8585424,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"3-6 Oct. 2017","start_page":"36","end_page":"47","citing_paper_count":24,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":994,"insert_date":"20181223","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Twitter","Rivers","Data visualization","Urban areas"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Social Media","Event Analysis","Map-like Visual Metaphor","Spatial Temporal Visual Analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Social Media","Social Platforms","Visual Analysis","Developmental Effects","Developmental Events","Feature Maps","Social Media Data","Social Media Analytics","Real-world Effectiveness","Real-world Consequences","Real-world Events","Evolution Of Events","Keyword Extraction","Analysis Of Effects","Analysis Of Events","Social Media Platforms","Dissemination Of Information","Information Diffusion","User Behavior","Node Positions","Location Of Nodes","North Korea","Characteristics Of Events","Features Of Events","Term Frequency-inverse Document Frequency","Inverse Document Frequency","TF-IDF","Thematic Evolution","Evolution Of Topics","Topic Development","Subject Of Development","Definition Of Events","US Election","American Elections","Elections In The United States","Social Media Messages","Sina Weibo","Visual Metaphors","Social Media Behavior","Hashtags","Familiar Ways","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Map Design","Cartographic Design","Cloud Data","Word Cloud"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3164-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3163-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2017.8585594","title":"Visualizing Real-Time Strategy Games: The Example of StarCraft II","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5386-3164-5","rank":45,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"National Chiao Tung University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085632802","id":37085632802,"full_name":"Yen-Ting Kuan","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["National Chiao Tung University"]}},{"affiliation":"National Chiao Tung University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407536000","id":37407536000,"full_name":"Yu-Shuen Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["National Chiao Tung University"]}},{"affiliation":"National Chiao Tung University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085630889","id":37085630889,"full_name":"Jung-Hong Chuang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["National Chiao Tung University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"We present a visualization system for users to examine real-time strategy games, which have become very popular globally in recent years.

In the global view, battles are depicted by curved arrows revealing how the armies enter and escape from the battlefield. By observing the arrows and the height map, users can make sense of offensive and defensive strategies easily. In the local view, units of each type are rendered on the map, and their movements are represented by animation. We also render an attack line between a pair of units if one of them can attack the other to help users analyze the advantages and disadvantages of a particular formation.

CrystalBall integrates new methods to discover events with interactive visualizations that permit sensemaking of the identified future events. Our computational methods integrate seven different measures to identify and characterize future events, leveraging information regarding time, location, social networks, and the informativeness of the messages. A visual interface is tightly coupled with the computational methods to present a concise summary of the possible future events. A novel connection graph and glyphs are designed to visualize the characteristics of the future events.

However, many subspace analysis methods produce an abundant amount of patterns, which often remain redundant and are difficult to relate. Creating effective layouts for comparison of subspace patterns remains challenging. We introduce Pattern Trails, a novel approach for visually ordering and comparing subspace patterns. Central to our approach is the notion of pattern transitions as an interpretable structure imposed to order and compare patterns between subspaces. The basic idea is to visualize projections of subspaces side-by-side, and indicate changes between adjacent patterns in the subspaces by a linked representation, hence introducing pattern transitions. Our contributions comprise a systematization for how pairs of subspace patterns can be compared, and how changes can be interpreted in terms of pattern transitions. We also contribute a technique for visual subspace analysis based on a data-driven similarity measure between subspace representations. This measure is useful to order the patterns, and interactively group subspaces to reduce redundancy. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by application to several use cases, indicating that data can be meaningfully ordered and interpreted in terms of pattern transitions.","article_number":"8585613","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8585613","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585613/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585613/","publication_title":"2017 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","conference_dates":"3-6 Oct. 2017","publication_number":8574342,"is_number":8585424,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"3-6 Oct. 2017","start_page":"1","end_page":"12","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":398,"insert_date":"20181223","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Task analysis","Data analysis","Visual analytics","Redundancy","Machine learning"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]","user Interfaces—Graphical User Interfaces","Interaction Styles"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Transition Patterns","Pattern Analysis","Visual Representation","Identification Of Patterns","Multivariate Data","Multivariate Statistics","Single Cluster","Interesting Patterns","Pattern Of Involvement","Understanding Of Patterns","Statistical Patterns","Patterns In Conditions","Multivariate Data Analysis","Interactive Visualization","Agglomerative Clustering","Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering","Interpretation Of Patterns","Visual Approach","Relevant Patterns","Automatic Approach","Parallel Coordinates","Projection Error","Subspace Projection","Subspace Clustering","Line Bundle","Automatic Method","Identification Of Changes","Changes In Patterns","Distance Matrix","Distance Matrices","University Rankings","Intersection Over Union","Jaccard Similarity","Jaccard Distance","Jaccard Index","Self-organizing Map","Kohonen","Wildfire","Forest Fires","Bushfire"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3164-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3163-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2017.8585487","title":"The “y” of it Matters, Even for Storyline Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5386-3164-5","rank":50,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085670117","id":37085670117,"full_name":"Dustin Arendt","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086068397","id":37086068397,"full_name":"Meg Pirrung","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Storylines are adept at communicating complex change by encoding time on the x-axis and using the proximity of lines in the y direction to represent interaction between entities. The original definition of a storyline visualization requires data defined in terms of explicit interaction groups. Relaxing this definition allows storyline visualization to be applied more generally, but this creates questions about how the y-coordinate should encode interactions when this is tied to a particular place or state. To answer this question, we conducted a design study where we considered two layout algorithm design alternatives within a geo-temporal analysis tool written to solve part of the VAST Challenge 2014. We measured the performance of users at overview and detail oriented tasks between two storyline layout algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work to question the design principles for storyline visualization, and what we found surprised us. For overview tasks with the alternative layout, which has a consistent encoding for the y-coordinate, users performed moderately better (p <; .05) than the storyline layout based on existing design constraints and aesthetic criteria. Our empirical findings were also supported by first-hand accounts taken from interviews with multiple expert analysts, who suggested that the inconsistent meaning of the y-axis was misleading. These findings led us to design a new storyline layout algorithm that is a “best of both” where the y-axis has a consistent meaning but aesthetic criteria (e.g., line crossings) are considered.","article_number":"8585487","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8585487","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585487/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585487/","publication_title":"2017 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","conference_dates":"3-6 Oct. 2017","publication_number":8574342,"is_number":8585424,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"3-6 Oct. 2017","start_page":"81","end_page":"91","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":547,"insert_date":"20181223","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Layout","Visualization","Tools","Public transportation","Data visualization","Heuristic algorithms","Interviews"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Storyline visualization","layout algorithms","interaction context","geospatial analysis","VAST Challenge"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Rational Design","Design Principles","Alternative Designs","Alternative Names","User Performance","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Line Crossings","Interactive","Time Scale","Time Step","Differences In Performance","Precision And Recall","Visualization Tool","Task Difficulty","Interaction Context","Eye-tracking Data","Multivariate Time Series","Univariate Time Series","Aforementioned Techniques","Life Patterns","Consistent Interpretation","Dynamic Visualization","Dynamic Graph","Time Granularity","Time Trend Analysis","Equal Spacing","Aesthetic Design","Visual Analytics Tool","Sankey Diagram","Sankey Plot","Spatial Encoding","Visual Analysis","Exit Interviews","Visualization Techniques"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3164-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3163-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2017.8585484","title":"CRICTO: Supporting Sensemaking through Crowdsourced Information Schematization","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5386-3164-5","rank":51,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Alabama in Huntsville","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37597408500","id":37597408500,"full_name":"Haeyong Chung","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Alabama in Huntsville"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Alabama in Huntsville","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086561811","id":37086561811,"full_name":"Sai Prashanth Dasari","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Alabama in Huntsville"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Alabama in Huntsville","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086553914","id":37086553914,"full_name":"Santhosh Nandhakumar","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Alabama in Huntsville"]}},{"affiliation":"Middlebury College","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37587847300","id":37587847300,"full_name":"Christopher Andrews","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Middlebury College"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"We present CRICTO, a new crowdsourcing visual analytics environment for making sense of and analyzing text data, whereby multiple crowdworkers are able to parallelize the simple information schematization tasks of relating and connecting entities across documents.

In this paper, we tackle the challenges of evaluation analysis in the domain of question-answering (QA) systems. Through in-depth studies with QA researchers, we identify tasks and goals of evaluation analysis and derive a set of design rationales, based on which we propose a novel approach termed prismatic analysis. Prismatic analysis examines data through multiple ways of categorization (referred as angles). Categories in each angle are measured by aggregate metrics to enable diverse comparison scenarios. To facilitate prismatic analysis of QA evaluations, we design and implement the Question Space Anglyzer (QSAnglyzer), a visual analytics (VA) tool. In QSAnglyzer, the high-dimensional space formed by questions is divided into categories based on several angles (e.g., topic and question type). Each category is aggregated by accuracy, the number of questions, and accuracy variance across evaluations. QSAnglyzer visualizes these angles so that QA researchers can examine and compare evaluations from various aspects both individually and collectively. Furthermore, QA researchers filter questions based on any angle by clicking to construct complex queries. We validate QSAnglyzer through controlled experiments and by expert reviews. The results indicate that when using QSAnglyzer, users perform analysis tasks faster (p <; 0.01) and more accurately (p <; 0.05), and are quick to gain new insight. We discuss how prismatic analysis and QSAnglyzer scaffold evaluation analysis, and provide directions for future research.","article_number":"8585733","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8585733","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585733/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585733/","publication_title":"2017 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","conference_dates":"3-6 Oct. 2017","publication_number":8574342,"is_number":8585424,"publication_year":2017,"publication_date":"3-6 Oct. 2017","start_page":"48","end_page":"58","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":203,"insert_date":"20181223","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Computational modeling","Task analysis","Measurement","Aggregates","Visual analytics","Knowledge discovery"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["visual analytics","visualization","interactive visualization","question answering","multi-experiment analysis","visual comparison","visual exploration","prismatic analysis","H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: User Interfaces—"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","High-dimensional","High-dimensional Space","Rational Design","Design Principles","In-depth Study","Types Of Questions","Expert Review","Variety Of Scenarios","Diverse Scenarios","Artificial Intelligence Systems","User Performance","Artificial Intelligence Research","Comparison Of Scenarios","Complex Queries","Visual Analytics Tool","Laboratory Studies","Excel Spreadsheet","Multiple-choice Questions","Rate Set","Evaluation Set","Confidence Score","Analysis Center","Subset Of Questions","Multi-view Learning","Answer Choices","Multiple Solutions","Question Categories","Question Classification","User Requirements","Intermediate Output","Recommender Systems","Workflow","Interactive Visualization"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3164-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3163-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2017.8585625","title":"VIS Capstone Address Data Humanism: The Revolution will be Visualized","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-5386-3164-5","rank":54,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Accurat","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38468285500","id":38468285500,"full_name":"Giorgia Lupi","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Accurat"]}}]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"It’s time to change our minds about data.
