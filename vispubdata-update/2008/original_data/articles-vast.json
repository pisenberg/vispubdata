The VAST 2008 Challenge is the third year that such a competition was held in conjunction with the IEEE Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST) symposium. The authors restructured the contest format used in 2006 and 2007 to reduce the barriers to participation and offered four mini-challenges and a Grand Challenge. Mini Challenge participants were to use visual analytic tools to explore one of four heterogeneous data collections to analyze specific activities of a fictitious, controversial movement. Questions asked in the Grand Challenge required the participants to synthesize data from all four data sets. In this paper we give a brief overview of the data sets, the tasks, the participation, the judging, and the results.","article_number":"4677383","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677383","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677383/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677383/","publication_title":"2008 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Columbus, OH, USA","conference_dates":"19-24 Oct. 2008","publication_number":4669530,"is_number":4677336,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"19-24 Oct. 2008","start_page":"195","end_page":"196","citing_paper_count":29,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":375,"insert_date":"20081118","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Feedback","Cellular phones","Performance analysis","Visualization","NIST","Data analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["visual analytics","human information interaction","sense making","evaluation","metrics","contest","H.5.2 [Information Interfaces & Presentations]: User Interfaces — Evaluation/methodology"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2935-6","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2008.4677377","title":"An information visualisation system for the understanding of web data","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-2935-6","partnum":"08EX2585","rank":2,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Web Research Group, Universitat Pompeu Fabra and Fundació Barcelona Media, Spain","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38275017300","id":38275017300,"full_name":"Victor Pascual-Cid","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Web Research Group, Universitat Pompeu Fabra and Fundació Barcelona Media, Spain"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Internet has become one of the best communication and marketing tools. Hence, designing well-structured Web sites with the information or products that users look for is a crucial mission. For this reason, understanding Web data is a decisive task to assure the success of a Website. In that sense, data mining techniques provide many metrics and statistics useful to automatically discover the structure, contents and usage of a site. This research aims at proving the usefulness of a set of information visualisation techniques in order to analyse Web data, using a visual Web mining tool that allows the combination, coordination and exploration of visualisations to get insight on Web data. The tool, named WET, provides a set of visual metaphors that represent the structure of the Websites where Web metrics are overlaid.","article_number":"4677377","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677377","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677377/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677377/","publication_title":"2008 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Columbus, OH, USA","conference_dates":"19-24 Oct. 2008","publication_number":4669530,"is_number":4677336,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"19-24 Oct. 2008","start_page":"183","end_page":"184","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":12,"download_count":412,"insert_date":"20081118","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Information analysis","Web mining","Data mining","Internet","Web page design","Data analysis","Service oriented architecture","Information retrieval","Logic"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["H.4.3 [Information Systems Applications]: Communications Applications—Information browsers","H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and Presentation(I.7)]: User Interfaces—Graphical user interfaces (GUI), Interaction styles","H.5.4 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: Hypertext/Hypermedia—Navigation, User issues"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2935-6","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2008.4677389","title":"Cell phone mini challenge award: Social network accuracy— exploring temporal communication in mobile call graphs","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-2935-6","partnum":"08EX2585","rank":3,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Beijing Key Lab of Intelligent Telecommunications Software and Multimedia, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087171914","id":37087171914,"full_name":"Qi Ye","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Beijing Key Lab of Intelligent Telecommunications Software and Multimedia, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Beijing Key Lab of Intelligent Telecommunications Software and Multimedia, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087172054","id":37087172054,"full_name":"Tian Zhu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Beijing Key Lab of Intelligent Telecommunications Software and Multimedia, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Beijing Key Lab of Intelligent Telecommunications Software and Multimedia, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087173126","id":37087173126,"full_name":"Deyong Hu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Beijing Key Lab of Intelligent Telecommunications Software and Multimedia, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Beijing Key Lab of Intelligent Telecommunications Software and Multimedia, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37545877500","id":37545877500,"full_name":"Bin Wu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Beijing Key Lab of Intelligent Telecommunications Software and Multimedia, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Beijing Key Lab of Intelligent Telecommunications Software and Multimedia, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087173154","id":37087173154,"full_name":"Nan Du","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Beijing Key Lab of Intelligent Telecommunications Software and Multimedia, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Beijing Key Lab of Intelligent Telecommunications Software and Multimedia, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087172402","id":37087172402,"full_name":"Bai Wang","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Beijing Key Lab of Intelligent Telecommunications Software and Multimedia, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"In the mobile call mini challenge of VAST 2008 contest, we explored the temporal communication patterns of Catalano/Vidro social network which is reflected in the mobile call data.

The dominant anthropogenic greenhouse gas that seems to be contributing to the climate change problem, carbon dioxide (CO2), has a complex cycle through the atmosphere, oceans and biosphere. The combustion of fossil fuels (power production, transportation, etc.) remains the largest source of anthropogenic CO2 to the Earth’s atmosphere. Up until very recently, the quantification of fossil fuel CO2 was understood only at coarse space and time scales. A recent research effort has greatly improved this space/time quantification resulting in source data at a resolution of less than 10 km2/hr at the surface of North America. By providing visual tools to examine this new, high resolution CO2 data, we can better understand the way that CO2 is transmitted within the atmosphere and how it is exchanged with other components of the Earth System. We have developed interactive visual analytic tools, which allows for easy data manipulation, analysis, and extraction. The visualization system is aimed for a wide range of users which include researchers and political leaders.

In the context of the VAST 2008 Challenge, we developed a visualization tool that graphically displays the movement of 82 employees of the Miami Department of Health (USA). We also asked 13 users to identify potential suspects and observe what happened during an evacuation of the building caused by an explosion. In this paper we explain the results of the user testing we conducted and how the users interpreted the event taken into account.","article_number":"4677390","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677390","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677390/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677390/","publication_title":"2008 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Columbus, OH, USA","conference_dates":"19-24 Oct. 2008","publication_number":4669530,"is_number":4677336,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"19-24 Oct. 2008","start_page":"209","end_page":"210","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":125,"insert_date":"20081118","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Animation","Data visualization","Visual analytics","System testing","Data security","Information processing","Psychology","Discrete event simulation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["user testing","evacuation","visual analytics","casualties detection","H.1.2 [Models and principles]: User/Machine Systems—Human information processing","H.1.2 [Models and principles]: User/Machine Systems—Software psychology"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2935-6","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2008.4677388","title":"Evacuation trace Mini Challenge award: Tool integration analysis of movements with Geospatial Visual Analytics Toolkit","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-2935-6","partnum":"08EX2585","rank":19,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer Institute of Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS), Sankt-Augustin, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047700","id":37283047700,"full_name":"Natalia Andrienko","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute of Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS), Sankt-Augustin, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer Institute of Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS), Sankt-Augustin, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047100","id":37283047100,"full_name":"Gennady Andrienko","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute of Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS), Sankt-Augustin, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"The Geospatial Visual Analytics Toolkit intended for exploratory analysis of spatial and spatio-temporal data has been recently enriched with specific visual and computational techniques supporting analysis of data about movement.

While work in this area has relied on either manually recorded provenance (e.g., user notes) or automatically recorded event-based insight provenance (e.g., clicks, drags, and key-presses), both approaches have fundamental limitations. Our aim is to develop a new approach that combines the benefits of both approaches while avoiding their deficiencies. Toward this goal, we characterize userspsila visual analytic activity at multiple levels of granularity. Moreover, we identify a critical level of abstraction, Actions, that can be used to represent visual analytic activity with a set of general but semantically meaningful behavior types. In turn, the action types can be used as the semantic building blocks for insight provenance. We present a catalog of common actions identified through observations of several different visual analytic systems. In addition, we define a taxonomy to categorize actions into three major classes based on their semantic intent. The concept of actions has been integrated into our labpsilas prototype visual analytic system, HARVEST, as the basis for its insight provenance capabilities.","article_number":"4677365","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677365","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677365/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677365/","publication_title":"2008 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Columbus, OH, USA","conference_dates":"19-24 Oct. 2008","publication_number":4669530,"is_number":4677336,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"19-24 Oct. 2008","start_page":"123","end_page":"130","citing_paper_count":47,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":714,"insert_date":"20081118","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Taxonomy","Information analysis","Data visualization","Investments","Mice","Prototypes","Information systems","Humans","Visual perception"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Taxonomy","Information Visualization","Analytic Activity","Visual Analytics","Insight Provenance","H.5.0 [Information Systems]: Information Interfaces and Presentation—General"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2935-6","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2008.4677350","title":"Visual cluster analysis of trajectory data with interactive Kohonen Maps","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-2935-6","partnum":"08EX2585","rank":30,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Interactive Graphics Systems Group, Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282557600","id":37282557600,"full_name":"Tobias Schreck","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Interactive Graphics Systems Group, Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Interactive Graphics Systems Group, Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606179600","id":37606179600,"full_name":"Jurgen Bernard","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Interactive Graphics Systems Group, Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Interactive Graphics Systems Group, Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087724135","id":37087724135,"full_name":"Tatiana Tekusova","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Interactive Graphics Systems Group, Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics IGD, Darmstadt, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37449689200","id":37449689200,"full_name":"Jorn Kohlhammer","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics IGD, Darmstadt, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Visual-interactive cluster analysis provides valuable tools for effectively analyzing large and complex data sets. Due to desirable properties and an inherent predisposition for visualization, the Kohonen Feature Map (or Self-Organizing Map, or SOM) algorithm is among the most popular and widely used visual clustering techniques. However, the unsupervised nature of the algorithm may be disadvantageous in certain applications. Depending on initialization and data characteristics, cluster maps (cluster layouts) may emerge that do not comply with user preferences, expectations, or the application context. Considering SOM-based analysis of trajectory data, we propose a comprehensive visual-interactive monitoring and control framework extending the basic SOM algorithm. The framework implements the general Visual Analytics idea to effectively combine automatic data analysis with human expert supervision. It provides simple, yet effective facilities for visually monitoring and interactively controlling the trajectory clustering process at arbitrary levels of detail. The approach allows the user to leverage existing domain knowledge and user preferences, arriving at improved cluster maps. We apply the framework on a trajectory clustering problem, demonstrating its potential in combining both unsupervised (machine) and supervised (human expert) processing, in producing appropriate cluster results.","article_number":"4677350","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677350","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677350/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677350/","publication_title":"2008 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Columbus, OH, USA","conference_dates":"19-24 Oct. 2008","publication_number":4669530,"is_number":4677336,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"19-24 Oct. 2008","start_page":"3","end_page":"10","citing_paper_count":38,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":628,"insert_date":"20081118","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data analysis","Trajectory","Self organizing feature maps","Clustering algorithms","Monitoring","Automatic control","Humans","Data visualization","Algorithm design and analysis","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["H.4 [Information Systems]: Information Systems Applications","I.3.6 [Computing Methodologies]: Computer Graphics—Methodology and Techniques"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2935-6","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2008.4677362","title":"Entity-based collaboration tools for intelligence analysis","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-2935-6","partnum":"08EX2585","rank":31,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Palo Alto Research Center, Inc.orporated, Palo Alto, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282252000","id":37282252000,"full_name":"Eric A.

Narratives is designed to help the user place news stories in their historical and social context by understanding how the major topics associated with them have changed over time. Users can relate articles through time by examining the topical keywords that summarize a specific news event.

A unique aspect of our approach is that the LP rules are automatically learned, using Inductive Logic Programming, from examples of data that the analyst deems interesting when viewing the data in the high-dimensional visualization interface. Using this system, analysts will be able to construct models of arbitrary relationships in the data, explore the data for scenarios that fit the model, refine the model if necessary, and query the model to automatically analyze incoming (future) data exhibiting the encoded relationships. In other words it will support both model-driven data exploration, as well as data-driven model evolution.

Coordinated multiple view approaches have become commonplace in visual analysis tools because they directly support expression of complex multidimensional queries using simple interactions. However, generating such tools remains difficult because of the need to map domain-specific data structures and semantics into the idiosyncratic combinations of interdependent data and visual abstractions needed to reveal particular patterns and distributions in cross-dimensional relationships. This paper describes: (1) a method for interactively expressing sequences of multidimensional set queries by cross-filtering data values across pairs of views, and (2) design strategies for constructing coordinated multiple view interfaces for cross-filtered visual analysis of multidimensional data sets. Using examples of cross-filtered visualizations of data from several different domains, we describe how cross-filtering can be modularized and reused across designs, flexibly customized with respect to data types across multiple dimensions, and incorporated into more wide-ranging multiple view designs. The demonstrated analytic utility of these examples suggest that cross-filtering is a suitable design pattern for instantiation in a wide variety of visual analysis tools.","article_number":"4677370","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677370","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677370/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677370/","publication_title":"2008 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Columbus, OH, USA","conference_dates":"19-24 Oct. 2008","publication_number":4669530,"is_number":4677336,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"19-24 Oct. 2008","start_page":"163","end_page":"170","citing_paper_count":19,"citing_patent_count":3,"download_count":432,"insert_date":"20081118","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Multidimensional systems","Data analysis","Data visualization","Pattern analysis","Management information systems","Prototypes","Usability","Geography","Data structures","Software engineering"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["D.2.2 [Software Engineering]: Design Tools and Techniques—[User Interfaces]","H.2.3 [Information Systems]: Database Management—[Languages]","H.5.2 [Information Systems]: Information Interfaces and Presentation—[User Interfaces]"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2935-6","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2008.4677360","title":"Evaluating the relationship between user interaction and financial visual analysis","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-2935-6","partnum":"08EX2585","rank":37,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Viscenter, UNC-Charlotte, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37400451800","id":37400451800,"full_name":"Dong Hyun Jeong","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Viscenter, UNC-Charlotte, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Viscenter, UNC-Charlotte, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087173877","id":37087173877,"full_name":"Wenwen Dou","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Viscenter, UNC-Charlotte, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"HCI Laboratory, UNC-Charlotte, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601288800","id":37601288800,"full_name":"Heather Richter Lipford","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["HCI Laboratory, UNC-Charlotte, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Viscenter, UNC-Charlotte, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601289000","id":37601289000,"full_name":"Felesia Stukes","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Viscenter, UNC-Charlotte, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Viscenter, UNC-Charlotte, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592409400","id":37592409400,"full_name":"Remco Chang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Viscenter, UNC-Charlotte, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"HCI Laboratory, UNC-Charlotte, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300425000","id":37300425000,"full_name":"William Ribarsky","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["HCI Laboratory, UNC-Charlotte, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"It has been widely accepted that interactive visualization techniques enable users to more effectively form hypotheses and identify areas for more detailed investigation.

Unfortunately, many outbreaks are difficult to detect because their signal is obscured by the statistical noise. Consequently, many detection algorithms have a high false positive rate. While many false alerts can be easily filtered by trained epidemiologists, others require health officials to drill down into the data, analyzing specific segments of the population and historical trends over time and space. Furthermore, the ability to accurately recognize meaningful patterns in the data becomes more challenging as these data sources increase in volume and complexity. To facilitate more accurate and efficient event detection, we have created a visual analytics tool that provides analysts with linked geo-spatiotemporal and statistical analytic views. We model syndromic hotspots by applying a kernel density estimation on the population sample. When an analyst selects a syndromic hotspot, temporal statistical graphs of the hotspot are created. Similarly, regions in the statistical plots may be selected to generate geospatial features specific to the current time period. Demographic filtering can then be combined to determine if certain populations are more affected than others. These tools allow analysts to perform real-time hypothesis testing and evaluation.","article_number":"4677354","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677354","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677354/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677354/","publication_title":"2008 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Columbus, OH, USA","conference_dates":"19-24 Oct. 2008","publication_number":4669530,"is_number":4677336,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"19-24 Oct. 2008","start_page":"35","end_page":"42","citing_paper_count":13,"citing_patent_count":4,"download_count":422,"insert_date":"20081118","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Data analysis","Surveillance","Medical services","Signal detection","Detection algorithms","Pattern recognition","Event detection","Kernel","Demography"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2935-6","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2008.4677359","title":"Visual evaluation of text features for document summarization and analysis","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-2935-6","partnum":"08EX2585","rank":41,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591207400","id":37591207400,"full_name":"Daniela Oelke","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37392085400","id":37392085400,"full_name":"Peter Bak","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","id":37283138700,"full_name":"Daniel A.

Moreover, to support the role of visualization in the knowledge creation process, it is advantageous to allow users to describe the reasoning strategies they employ while interacting with analytic environments. We introduce an application suite called the scalable reasoning system (SRS), which provides Web-based and mobile interfaces for visual analysis. The service-oriented analytic framework that underlies SRS provides a platform for deploying pervasive visual analytic environments across an enterprise. SRS represents a ldquolightweightrdquo approach to visual analytics whereby thin client analytic applications can be rapidly deployed in a platform-agnostic fashion. Client applications support multiple coordinated views while giving analysts the ability to record evidence, assumptions, hypotheses and other reasoning artifacts. We describe the capabilities of SRS in the context of a real-world deployment at a regional law enforcement organization.","article_number":"4677366","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677366","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677366/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677366/","publication_title":"2008 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Columbus, OH, USA","conference_dates":"19-24 Oct. 2008","publication_number":4669530,"is_number":4677336,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"19-24 Oct. 2008","start_page":"131","end_page":"138","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":331,"insert_date":"20081118","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Visual analytics","Handheld computers","Law enforcement","Computer interfaces","Information analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Computer networks","Pervasive computing","Computer displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Web visualization","mobile visualization","analytic reasoning","law enforcement","multiple views","H.5.3 [Information Systems]: Information Interfaces and Presentation—Group and Organization Interfaces","C.2.4 [Computer Systems Organization]: Computer-Communication Networks —Distributed Systems"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2935-6","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2008.4677351","title":"Crystal structures classifier for an evolutionary algorithm structure predictor","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-2935-6","partnum":"08EX2585","rank":43,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Data Analysis and Visualization Services, Swiss National Supercomputing Centre, Switzerland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37866298300","id":37866298300,"full_name":"Mario Valle","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Data Analysis and Visualization Services, Swiss National Supercomputing Centre, Switzerland"]}},{"affiliation":"Laboratory of Crystallography, Department of Materials, ETH Zürich","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37570687200","id":37570687200,"full_name":"Artem R.

Every USPEX run produces hundreds or thousands of crystal structures, some of which may be identical. To ease the extraction of unique and potentially interesting structures we applied usual high-dimensional classification concepts to the unusual field of crystallography. We experimented with various crystal structure descriptors, distinct distance measures and tried different clustering methods to identify groups of similar structures. These methods are already applied in combinatorial chemistry to organic molecules for a different goal and in somewhat different forms, but are not widely used for crystal structures classification. We adopted a visual design and validation method in the development of a library (CrystalFp) and an end-user application to select and validate method choices, to gain userspsila acceptance and to tap into their domain expertise. The use of the classifier has already accelerated the analysis of USPEX output by at least one order of magnitude, promoting some new crystallographic insight and discovery. Furthermore the visual display of key algorithm indicators has led to diverse, unexpected discoveries that will improve the USPEX algorithms.","article_number":"4677351","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677351","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677351/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677351/","publication_title":"2008 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Columbus, OH, USA","conference_dates":"19-24 Oct. 2008","publication_number":4669530,"is_number":4677336,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"19-24 Oct. 2008","start_page":"11","end_page":"18","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":524,"insert_date":"20081118","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Evolutionary computation","Crystallography","Clustering methods","Chemistry","Design methodology","Libraries","Multidimensional systems","Crystalline materials","Acceleration","Electronic mail"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["J.2 [Physical Sciences and Engineering]: Chemistry","I.5.2 [Pattern Recognition]: Design Methodology—Classifier design and evaluation"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2935-6","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2008.4677355","title":"Configurable Spaces: Temporal analysis in diagrammatic contexts","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-2935-6","partnum":"08EX2585","rank":44,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Oculus Info Inc., USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37704437500","id":37704437500,"full_name":"Thomas Kapler","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oculus Info Inc., USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Oculus Info Inc., USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37425695700","id":37425695700,"full_name":"Ryan Eccles","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oculus Info Inc., USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Oculus Info Inc., USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37594531000","id":37594531000,"full_name":"Robert Harper","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oculus Info Inc., USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Oculus Info Inc., USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37654961400","id":37654961400,"full_name":"William Wright","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oculus Info Inc., USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Social network graphs, concept maps, and process charts are examples of diagrammatic representations employed by intelligence analysts to understand complex systems. Unfortunately, these 2D representations currently do not easily convey the flow, sequence, tempo and other important dynamic behaviors within these systems. In this paper we present Configurable Spaces, a novel analytical method for visualizing patterns of activity over time in complex diagrammatically- represented systems. Configurable Spaces extends GeoTime's X, Y, T coordinate workspace space for temporal analysis to any arbitrary diagrammatic work space by replacing a geographic map with a diagram. This paper traces progress from concept to prototype, and discusses how diagrams can be created, transformed and leveraged for analysis, including generating diagrams from knowledge bases, visualizing temporal concept maps, and the use of linked diagrams for exploring complex, multi-dimensional, sequences of events. An evaluation of the prototype by the National Institute of Standards and Technology showed intelligence analysts believed they were able to attain an increased level of insight, were able to explore data more efficiently, and that Configurable Spaces would help them work faster.","article_number":"4677355","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677355","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677355/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677355/","publication_title":"2008 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Columbus, OH, USA","conference_dates":"19-24 Oct. 2008","publication_number":4669530,"is_number":4677336,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"19-24 Oct. 2008","start_page":"43","end_page":"50","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":296,"insert_date":"20081118","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Space technology","Prototypes","Data visualization","Visual analytics","Social network services","Pattern analysis","NIST","Humans","Graphical user interfaces","Information analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["human information interaction","visual analytics","graph visualization","geo-temporal analysis","concept maps"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2935-6","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2008.4677367","title":"Generating hypotheses of trends in high-dimensional data skeletons","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-2935-6","partnum":"08EX2585","rank":45,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37673742400","id":37673742400,"full_name":"Chandan K.

We describe a new algorithm to find the optimal paths through such a principal graph.

How to automatically and effectively discover new knowledge from rich multimedia data poses a compelling challenge since state-of-the-art data mining techniques can most often only search and extract pre-defined patterns or knowledge from complex heterogeneous data. In light of this, our approach is to take advantages of both the power of human perception system and the power of computational algorithms. More specifically, we propose an approach that allows scientists to use data mining as a first pass, and then forms a closed loop of visual analysis of current results followed by more data mining work inspired by visualization, the results of which can be in turn visualized and lead to the next round of visual exploration and analysis. In this way, new insights and hypotheses gleaned from the raw data and the current level of analysis can contribute to further analysis. As a first step toward this goal, we implement a visualization system with three critical components: (1) A smooth interface between visualization and data mining. The new analysis results can be automatically loaded into our visualization tool. (2) A flexible tool to explore and query temporal data derived from raw multimedia data. We represent temporal data into two forms - continuous variables and event variables. We have developed various ways to visualize both temporal correlations and statistics of multiple variables with the same type, and conditional and high-order statistics between continuous and event variables. (3) A seamless interface between raw multimedia data and derived data. Our visualization tool allows users to explore, compare, and analyze multi-stream derived variables and simultaneously switch to access raw multimedia data. We demonstrate various functions in our visualization program using a set of multimedia data including video, audio and motion tracking data.","article_number":"4677369","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677369","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677369/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677369/","publication_title":"2008
