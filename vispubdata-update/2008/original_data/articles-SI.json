For large graphs, excessive edge crossings make the display visually cluttered and thus difﬁcult to explore. In this paper, we propose a novel geometry-based edge-clustering framework that can group edges into bundles to reduce the overall edge crossings. Our method uses a control mesh to guide the edge-clustering process; edge bundles can be formed by forcing all edges to pass through some control points on the mesh. The control mesh can be generated at different levels of detail either manually or automatically based on underlying graph patterns. Users can further interact with the edge-clustering results through several advanced visualization techniques such as color and opacity enhancement. Compared with other edge-clustering methods, our approach is intuitive, ﬂexible, and efﬁcient. The experiments on some large graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.","article_number":"4658140","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658140","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658140/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658140/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"1277","end_page":"1284","citing_paper_count":190,"citing_patent_count":6,"download_count":2555,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Cities and towns","Road transportation","Automatic control","Data visualization","Displays","Automatic generation control","Mesh generation","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Switches"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—","Graph visualization","visual clutter","mesh","edge clustering"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.153","title":"Rolling the Dice: Multidimensional Visual Exploration using Scatterplot Matrix Navigation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":2,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"INRIA, Paris, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295438200","id":37295438200,"full_name":"Niklas Elmqvist","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["INRIA, Paris, France"]}},{"affiliation":"INRIA, Paris, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590932700","id":37590932700,"full_name":"Pierre Dragicevic","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["INRIA, Paris, France"]}},{"affiliation":"INRIA, Paris, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407972900","id":37407972900,"full_name":"Jean-Daniel Fekete","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["INRIA, Paris, France"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Scatterplots remain one of the most popular and widely-used visual representations for multidimensional data due to their simplicity, familiarity and visual clarity, even if they lack some of the flexibility and visual expressiveness of newer multidimensional visualization techniques. This paper presents new interactive methods to explore multidimensional data using scatterplots. This exploration is performed using a matrix of scatterplots that gives an overview of the possible configurations, thumbnails of the scatterplots, and support for interactive navigation in the multidimensional space. Transitions between scatterplots are performed as animated rotations in 3D space, somewhat akin to rolling dice. Users can iteratively build queries using bounding volumes in the dataset, sculpting the query from different viewpoints to become more and more refined. Furthermore, the dimensions in the navigation space can be reordered, manually or automatically, to highlight salient correlations and differences among them. An example scenario presents the interaction techniques supporting smooth and effortless visual exploration of multidimensional datasets.","article_number":"4658123","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658123","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658123/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658123/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"1539","end_page":"1148","citing_paper_count":259,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":3791,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Multidimensional systems","Navigation","Light scattering","Data visualization","Animation","Graphics","Visual analytics","Optical polarization","Vocabulary","Rendering (computer graphics)"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—","visual exploration","visual queries","visual analytics","navigation","multivariate data","interaction"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.166","title":"Stacked Graphs – Geometry & Aesthetics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":3,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"The New York Times","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37868017200","id":37868017200,"full_name":"Lee Byron","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The New York Times"]}},{"affiliation":"Visual Communication Laboratory at IBM","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550759700","id":37550759700,"full_name":"Martin Wattenberg","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Communication Laboratory at IBM"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In February 2008, the New York Times published an unusual chart of box office revenues for 7500 movies over 21 years.

This technique has recently gained new prominence for presentations, most notably with Gapminder Trendalyzer. In Trendalyzer, animation together with interesting data and an engaging presenter helps the audience understand the results of an analysis of the data. It is less clear whether trend animation is effective for analysis. This paper proposes two alternative trend visualizations that use static depictions of trends: one which shows traces of all trends overlaid simultaneously in one display and a second that uses a small multiples display to show the trend traces side-by-side. The paper evaluates the three visualizations for both analysis and presentation. Results indicate that trend animation can be challenging to use even for presentations; while it is the fastest technique for presentation and participants find it enjoyable and exciting, it does lead to many participant errors. Animation is the least effective form for analysis; both static depictions of trends are significantly faster than animation, and the small multiples display is more accurate.","article_number":"4658146","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658146","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658146/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658146/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"1325","end_page":"1332","citing_paper_count":235,"citing_patent_count":5,"download_count":4021,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Animation","Data visualization","Data analysis","Displays","Dictionaries"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—","Information visualization","animation","trends","design","experiment"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.172","title":"The Word Tree, an Interactive Visual Concordance","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":5,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"IBM Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550759700","id":37550759700,"full_name":"Martin Wattenberg","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IBM Research"]}},{"affiliation":"IBM Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681355300","id":37681355300,"full_name":"Fernanda B.

However, efficient computation of the MS complex for large scale data remains a challenging problem. We describe a new algorithm and easily extensible framework for computing MS complexes for large scale data of any dimension where scalar values are given at the vertices of a closure-finite and weak topology (CW) complex, therefore enabling computation on a wide variety of meshes such as regular grids, simplicial meshes, and adaptive multiresolution (AMR) meshes. A new divide-and-conquer strategy allows for memory-efficient computation of the MS complex and simplification on-the-fly to control the size of the output. In addition to being able to handle various data formats, the framework supports implementation-specific optimizations, for example, for regular data. We present the complete characterization of critical point cancellations in all dimensions. This technique enables the topology based analysis of large data on off-the-shelf computers.

Based on different temporal trends exhibited by importance curves and their clustering results, we suggest several interesting and effective visualization techniques to reveal the important aspects of time-varying data.","article_number":"4658174","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658174","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658174/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658174/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"1547","end_page":"1554","citing_paper_count":114,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2085,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Entropy","Transfer functions","Information theory","Time measurement","Chaos","Data engineering","Data analysis","Information analysis","Earthquakes"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—","Time-varying data","conditional entropy","joint feature-temporal space","clustering","highlighting","transfer function."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.119","title":"Continuous Scatterplots","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":11,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"VISUS (Visualization Research Center), Universität Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869985900","id":37869985900,"full_name":"Sven Bachthaler","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VISUS (Visualization Research Center), Universität Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"VISUS (Visualization Research Center), Universität Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268045000","id":37268045000,"full_name":"Daniel Weiskopf","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VISUS (Visualization Research Center), Universität Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Scatterplots are well established means of visualizing discrete data values with two data variables as a collection of discrete points. We aim at generalizing the concept of scatterplots to the visualization of spatially continuous input data by a continuous and dense plot. An example of a continuous input field is data defined on an n-D spatial grid with respective interpolation or reconstruction of in-between values. We propose a rigorous, accurate, and generic mathematical model of continuous scatterplots that considers an arbitrary density defined on an input field on an n-D domain and that maps this density to m-D scatterplots. Special cases are derived from this generic model and discussed in detail: scatterplots where the n-D spatial domain and the m-D data attribute domain have identical dimension, 1-D scatterplots as a way to define continuous histograms, and 2-D scatterplots of data on 3-D spatial grids. We show how continuous histograms are related to traditional discrete histograms and to the histograms of isosurface statistics. Based on the mathematical model of continuous scatterplots, respective visualization algorithms are derived, in particular for 2-D scatterplots of data from 3-D tetrahedral grids. For several visualization tasks, we show the applicability of continuous scatterplots. Since continuous scatterplots do not only sample data at grid points but interpolate data values within cells, a denseand complete visualization of the data set is achieved that scales well with increasing data set size. Especially for irregular grids with varying cell size, improved results are obtained when compared to conventional scatterplots. Therefore, continuous scatterplots are a suitable extension of a statistics visualization technique to be applied to typical data from scientific computation.","article_number":"4658159","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658159","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658159/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658159/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"1428","end_page":"1435","citing_paper_count":114,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1254,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Scattering","Data visualization","Histograms","Interpolation","Mathematical model","Statistics","Frequency","Computer Society","Isosurfaces","Displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—","Scatterplot","histogram","continuous frequency plot","interpolation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.165","title":"Spatially Ordered Treemaps","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":12,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Informatics, City University, London, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399045100","id":37399045100,"full_name":"Jo Wood","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Informatics, City University, London, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Informatics, City University, London, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37605079900","id":37605079900,"full_name":"Jason Dykes","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Informatics, City University, London, UK"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Existing treemap layout algorithms suffer to some extent from poor or inconsistent mappings between data order and visual ordering in their representation, reducing their cognitive plausibility.

Since the popular diffusion tensor (DT-MRI) model is limited to voxels with a single fiber direction, a number of high angular resolution techniques have been proposed to provide information about more diverse fiber distributions. Two such approaches are Q-Ball imaging and spherical deconvolution, which produce orientation distribution functions (ODFs) on the sphere. For analysis and visualization, the maxima of these functions have been used as principal directions, even though the results are known to be biased in case of crossing fiber tracts. In this paper, we present a more reliable technique for extracting discrete orientations from continuous ODFs, which is based on decomposing their higher-order tensor representation into an isotropic component, several rank-1 terms, and a small residual. Comparing to ground truth in synthetic data shows that the novel method reduces bias and reliably reconstructs crossing fibers which are not resolved as individual maxima in the ODF. We present results on both Q-Ball and spherical deconvolution data and demonstrate that the estimated directions allow for plausible fiber tracking in a real data set.","article_number":"4658185","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658185","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658185/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658185/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"1635","end_page":"1642","citing_paper_count":93,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":775,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Tensile stress","Deconvolution","Magnetic resonance imaging","Nerve fibers","Diffusion tensor imaging","High-resolution imaging","Distribution functions","Visualization","Data mining","Image reconstruction"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—","DW-MRI","Q-Ball","spherical deconvolution","fiber tracking","higher-order tensor","tensor decomposition."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.127","title":"EMDialog: Bringing Information Visualization into the Museum","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":15,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Calgary, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869968000","id":37869968000,"full_name":"Uta Hinrichs","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary, Canada"]}},{"authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37874733000","id":37874733000,"full_name":"Holly Schmidt","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":null}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37285000100","id":37285000100,"full_name":"Sheelagh Carpendale","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary, Canada"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Digital information displays are becoming more common in public spaces such as museums, galleries, and libraries.

In the field of visualization, however, the use of systematic rules embracing these aspects has received less attention. The situation is further complicated by the fact that visualization often uses semi-transparencies to reveal occluded objects, in which case the resulting color mixing effects add additional constraints to the choice of the color palette. Color design forms a crucial part in visual aesthetics. Thus, the consideration of these issues can be of great value in the emerging field of illustrative visualization. We describe a knowledge-based system that captures established color design rules into a comprehensive interactive framework, aimed to aid users in the selection of colors for scene objects and incorporating individual preferences, importance functions, and overall scene composition. Our framework also offers new knowledge and solutions for the mixing, ordering and choice of colors in the rendering of semi-transparent layers and surfaces. All design rules are evaluated via user studies, for which we extend the method of conjoint analysis to task-based testing scenarios. Our framework's use of principles rooted in color design with application for the illustration of features in pre-classified data distinguishes it from existing systems which target the exploration of continuous-range density data via perceptual color maps.","article_number":"4658198","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658198","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658198/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658198/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"1739","end_page":"1754","citing_paper_count":85,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":3090,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Color","Data visualization","Layout","Graphics","Knowledge based systems","Rendering (computer graphics)","Testing","Humans","Visual perception","Engines"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—","Color design","volume rendering","transparency","user study evaluation","conjoint analysis","illustrative visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.109","title":"A Framework of Interaction Costs in Information Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":17,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of British Columbia, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37873130000","id":37873130000,"full_name":"Heidi Lam","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of British Columbia, Canada"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Interaction cost is an important but poorly understood factor in visualization design.

Small multiple views of different experimental conditions and a data-driven parallel coordinates view enable correlations between experimental conditions to be analyzed at the same time that the data is viewed in the graph context. This combination of coordinated views allows the biologist to view the data from many different perspectives simultaneously.

The process of understanding a visualization therefore involves an interaction between these external visual metaphors and the user's internal knowledge representations. To investigate this claim, we conducted an experiment to test the effects of visual metaphor and verbal metaphor on the understanding of tree visualizations. Participants answered simple data comprehension questions while viewing either a treemap or a node-link diagram. Questions were worded to reflect a verbal metaphor that was either compatible or incompatible with the visualization a participant was using. The results suggest that the visual metaphor indeed affects how a user derives information from a visualization. Additionally, we found that the degree to which a user is affected by the metaphor is strongly correlated with the user's ability to answer task questions correctly. These findings are a first step towards illuminating how visual metaphors shape user understanding, and have significant implications for the evaluation, application, and theory of visualization.","article_number":"4658138","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658138","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658138/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658138/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"1269","end_page":"1276","citing_paper_count":76,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1909,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Shape","Delay","Tree graphs","Knowledge representation","Testing","Cognition","Usability","Performance evaluation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—","Cognition","visualization theory","metaphors","hierarchies","evaluation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.121","title":"Distributed Cognition as a Theoretical Framework for Information Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":20,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Interactive Computing and the GVU Center, Georgia Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592993600","id":37592993600,"full_name":"Zhicheng Liu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Interactive Computing and the GVU Center, Georgia Institute of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Interactive Computing and the School of Public Policy, Georgia Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37412991300","id":37412991300,"full_name":"Nancy Nersessian","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Interactive Computing and the School of Public Policy, Georgia Institute of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Interactive Computing and the GVU Center, Georgia Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267736900","id":37267736900,"full_name":"John Stasko","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Interactive Computing and the GVU Center, Georgia Institute of Technology"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Even though information visualization (InfoVis) research has matured in recent years, it is generally acknowledged that the field still lacks supporting, encompassing theories. In this paper, we argue that the distributed cognition framework can be used to substantiate the theoretical foundation of InfoVis. We highlight fundamental assumptions and theoretical constructs of the distributed cognition approach, based on the cognitive science literature and a real life scenario. We then discuss how the distributed cognition framework can have an impact on the research directions and methodologies we take as InfoVis researchers. Our contributions are as follows. First, we highlight the view that cognition is more an emergent property of interaction than a property of the human mind. Second, we argue that a reductionist approach to study the abstract properties of isolated human minds may not be useful in informing InfoVis design. Finally we propose to make cognition an explicit research agenda, and discuss the implications on how we perform evaluation and theory building.","article_number":"4658127","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658127","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658127/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658127/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"1173","end_page":"1180","citing_paper_count":75,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2391,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Cognition","Humans","Cognitive science","Data visualization","Electronic mail","Testing","Performance evaluation","Buildings","Distributed computing","Guidelines"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—","Information visualization","distributed cognition","interaction","representation","theory and methods"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.169","title":"Texture-based Transfer Functions for Direct Volume Rendering","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":21,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland (UMBC), USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37541275000","id":37541275000,"full_name":"Jesus J.

Those parameters can determine the effectiveness and accuracy of the visualization. Frequently, volumetric data includes multiple structures and features that need to be differentiated. However, if those features have the same intensity and gradient values, existing transfer functions are limited at effectively illustrating those similar features with different rendering properties. We introduce texture-based transfer functions for direct volume rendering. In our approach, the voxelpsilas resulting opacity and color are based on local textural properties rather than individual intensity values. For example, if the intensity values of the vessels are similar to those on the boundary of the lungs, our texture-based transfer function will analyze the textural properties in those regions and color them differently even though they have the same intensity values in the volume. The use of texture-based transfer functions has several benefits. First, structures and features with the same intensity and gradient values can be automatically visualized with different rendering properties. Second, segmentation or prior knowledge of the specific features within the volume is not required for classifying these features differently. Third, textural metrics can be combined and/or maximized to capture and better differentiate similar structures. We demonstrate our texture-based transfer function for direct volume rendering with synthetic and real-world medical data to show the strength of our technique.","article_number":"4658151","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658151","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658151/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658151/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"1364","end_page":"1371","citing_paper_count":69,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1087,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Transfer functions","Data visualization","Biomedical imaging","Image color analysis","Computer science","Lungs","Statistical analysis","Probes","Image segmentation","Visual system"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—","visualization","statistical analysis","volume rendering","data variability","medical imaging"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.155","title":"Perceptual Organization in User-Generated Graph Layouts","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":22,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"IBM Research Cambridge, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37326291000","id":37326291000,"full_name":"Frank van Ham","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IBM Research Cambridge, MA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"IBM Research Hawthorne, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37332114400","id":37332114400,"full_name":"Bernice Rogowitz","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IBM Research Hawthorne, NY, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Many graph layout algorithms optimize visual characteristics to achieve useful representations. Implicitly, their goal is to create visual representations that are more intuitive to human observers. In this paper, we asked users to explicitly manipulate nodes in a network diagram to create layouts that they felt best captured the relationships in the data. This allowed us to measure organizational behavior directly, allowing us to evaluate the perceptual importance of particular visual features, such as edge crossings and edge-lengths uniformity. We also manipulated the interior structure of the node relationships by designing data sets that contained clusters, that is, sets of nodes that are strongly interconnected. By varying the degree to which these clusters were “masked” by extraneous edges we were able to measure observers’ sensitivity to the existence of clusters and how they revealed them in the network diagram. Based on these measurements we found that observers are able to recover cluster structure, that the distance between clusters is inversely related to the strength of the clustering, and that users exhibit the tendency to use edges to visually delineate perceptual groups. These results demonstrate the role of perceptual organization in representing graph data and provide concrete recommendations for graph layout algorithms.","article_number":"4658147","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658147","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658147/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658147/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"1333","end_page":"1339","citing_paper_count":65,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":782,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Humans","Clustering algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Particle measurements","Concrete","Data visualization","Neural networks","Communication networks","Social network services","Performance analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—","Network layout visualization","perceptual organization","graph layout","user studies"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.174","title":"VisComplete: Automating Suggestions for Visualization Pipelines","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":23,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Computing, University of Utah, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37647314800","id":37647314800,"full_name":"D.

In this work we present a novel hierarchical point placement technique that is capable of dealing with these problems.

In practice, our algorithm can perform geometric sound propagation in complex scenes at 4-20 frames per second on a multi-core PC.","article_number":"4658194","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658194","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658194/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658194/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"1707","end_page":"1722","citing_paper_count":53,"citing_patent_count":13,"download_count":446,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Acoustic propagation","Layout","Acoustic diffraction","Computational modeling","Solid modeling","Virtual environment","Interactive systems","Visualization","Auditory displays","Real time systems"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—","Sound propagation","interactive system","auralization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.133","title":"Generation of Accurate Integral Surfaces in Time-Dependent Vector Fields","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":29,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Institute of Data Analysis and Visualization, University of California, Davis, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282573700","id":37282573700,"full_name":"Christoph Garth","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Data Analysis and Visualization, University of California, Davis, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Data Analysis and Visualization, University of California, Davis, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38556273200","id":38556273200,"full_name":"Han Krishnan","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Data Analysis and Visualization, University of California, Davis, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science Dept., Purdue University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282575100","id":37282575100,"full_name":"Xavier Tricoche","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Dept., Purdue University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Geometric Algorithms Group, University of Kaiserslautern","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37728450600","id":37728450600,"full_name":"Tom Bobach","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Geometric Algorithms Group, University of Kaiserslautern"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Data Analysis and Visualization, University of California, Davis, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267811400","id":37267811400,"full_name":"Kenneth I.

The main difficulties that arise when applying PCPs to large numbers of data points are visual clutter and slow performance, making interactive exploration infeasible. Moreover, the spatial context of the volumetric data is usually lost. We describe techniques for preprocessing using data quantization and compression, and for fast GPU-based rendering of PCPs using joint density distributions for each pair of consecutive variables, resulting in a smooth, continuous visualization. Also, fast brushing techniques are proposed for interactive data selection in multiple linked views, including a 3D spatial volume view. These techniques have been successfully applied to three large data sets: Hurricane Isabel (Vis'04 contest), the ionization front instability data set (Vis'08 design contest), and data from a large-eddy simulation of cumulus clouds. With these data, we show how PCPs can be extended to successfully visualize and interactively explore multi-timepoint volumetric datasets with an order of magnitude more data points.","article_number":"4658160","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658160","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658160/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658160/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"1436","end_page":"1451","citing_paper_count":50,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":822,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Quantization","Data analysis","Scattering","Scalability","Usability","Data preprocessing","Hurricanes","Ionization","Clouds"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—","Parallel coordinate plots","time-varying","multi-field","linked related views."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.163","title":"Smoke Surfaces: An Interactive Flow Visualization Technique Inspired by Real-World Flow Experiments","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":31,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"MPI Informatik Saarbrücken","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869714300","id":37869714300,"full_name":"Wolfram von Funck","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["MPI Informatik Saarbrücken"]}},{"affiliation":"Zuse Institute Berlin","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282635100","id":37282635100,"full_name":"Tino Weinkauf","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zuse Institute Berlin"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266875400","id":37266875400,"full_name":"Holger Theisel","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Magdeburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"MPI Informatik Saarbrücken","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271851300","id":37271851300,"full_name":"Hans-Peter Seidel","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["MPI Informatik Saarbrücken"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Smoke rendering is a standard technique for flow visualization.

If the results are not satisfactory, region growing must be performed again with different parameters. In contrast, our method allows interactive exploration of the parameter space, completely separated from region growing in an unattended pre-processing stage. The pre-computed feature volume tracks a feature size curve for each voxelover time, which is identified with the main region growing parameter such as variance. A novel 3D transfer function domain over (density, feature size, time) allows for interactive exploration of feature classes. Features and feature size curves can also be explored individually, which helps with transfer function specification and allows coloring individual features and disabling features resulting from CT artifacts.

To preserve the expressiveness of the visual representation, a placed label should neither occlude other labels nor visual representatives (e.g., icons, lines) that communicate crucial information. Optimal, non-overlapping labeling is an NP-hard problem. Thus, only a few approaches achieve a fast non-overlapping labeling in highly interactive scenarios like information visualization. These approaches generally target the point-feature label placement (PFLP) problem, solving only label-label conflicts. This paper presents a new, fast, solid and flexible 2D labeling approach for the PFLP problem that additionally respects other visual elements and the visual extent of labeled features. The results (number of placed labels, processing time) of our particle-based method compare favorably to those of existing techniques. Although the esthetic quality of non-real-time approaches may not be achieved with our method, it complies with practical demands and thus supports the interactive exploration of information spaces. In contrast to the known adjacent techniques, the flexibility of our technique enables labeling of dense point clouds by the use of non-occluding distant labels.

The key insight is that degenerate lines in tensor fields, as defined by the standard topological approach, are exactly crease (ridge and valley) lines of a particular tensor invariant called mode. This reformulation allows us to apply well-studied approaches from scientific visualization or computer vision to the extraction of topological lines in tensor fields. More generally, this main result suggests that other tensor invariants, such as anisotropy measures like fractional anisotropy (FA), can be used in the same framework in lieu of mode to identify important structural properties in tensor fields. Our implementation addresses the specific challenge posed by the non-linearity of the considered scalar measures and by the smoothness requirement of the crease manifold computation. We use a combination of smooth reconstruction kernels and adaptive refinement strategy that automatically adjust the resolution of the analysis to the spatial variation of the considered quantities. Together, these improvements allow for the robust application of existing ridge line extraction algorithms in the tensor context of our problem. Results are proposed for a diffusion tensor MRI dataset, and for a benchmark stress tensor field used in engineering research.","article_number":"4658184","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658184","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658184/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658184/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"1627","end_page":"1634","citing_paper_count":45,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":386,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Tensile stress","Topology","Biomedical imaging","Computer vision","Data mining","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Magnetic resonance imaging","Data engineering","Data visualization","Hospitals"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—","Tensor ﬁ","elds","tensor invariants","ridge lines","crease extraction","structural analysis","topology"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.154","title":"Particle-based Sampling and Meshing of Surfaces in Multimaterial Volumes","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":38,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Initiative in Innovative Computing, Harvard University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564728700","id":37564728700,"full_name":"Miriah Meyer","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Initiative in Innovative Computing, Harvard University, USA","Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267322600","id":37267322600,"full_name":"Ross Whitaker","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275716100","id":37275716100,"full_name":"Robert M.

The generation of such multimaterial models from measured data poses two unique challenges: first, the surfaces must be well-sampled with regular, efficient tessellations that are consistent across material boundaries; and second, the resulting meshes must respect the nonmanifold geometry of the multimaterial interfaces. This paper proposes a strategy for sampling and meshing multimaterial volumes using dynamic particle systems, including a novel, differentiable representation of the material junctions that allows the particle system to explicitly sample corners, edges, and surfaces of material intersections. The distributions of particles are controlled by fundamental sampling constraints, allowing Delaunay-based meshing algorithms to reliably extract watertight meshes of consistently high-quality.","article_number":"4658173","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658173","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658173/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658173/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"1539","end_page":"1546","citing_paper_count":44,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":365,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Sampling methods","Solid modeling","Biological materials","Geometry","Biomedical materials","Magnetic resonance imaging","Data visualization","Data mining","Geophysics computing","Scientific computing"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—","Sampling","meshing","visualizations"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.139","title":"Hypothesis Generation in Climate Research with Interactive Visual Data Exploration","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":39,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Norway","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546620000","id":37546620000,"full_name":"Johannes Kehrer","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Norway"]}},{"affiliation":"Wegener Center for Climate and Global Change (WegCenter) and the Institute for Geophysics, Astrophysics, and Meteorology (IGAM), University of Graz, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869982700","id":37869982700,"full_name":"Florian Ladstädter","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Wegener Center for Climate and Global Change (WegCenter) and the Institute for Geophysics, Astrophysics, and Meteorology (IGAM), University of Graz, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center, SimVis GmbH, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546620600","id":37546620600,"full_name":"Philipp Muigg","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VRVis Research Center, SimVis GmbH, Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center, SimVis GmbH, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546620400","id":37546620400,"full_name":"Helmut Doleisch","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VRVis Research Center, SimVis GmbH, Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Wegener Center for Climate and Global Change (WegCenter) and the Institute for Geophysics, Astrophysics, and Meteorology (IGAM), University of Graz, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089308969","id":37089308969,"full_name":"Andrea Steiner","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Wegener Center for Climate and Global Change (WegCenter) and the Institute for Geophysics, Astrophysics, and Meteorology (IGAM), University of Graz, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Norway","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274158800","id":37274158800,"full_name":"Helwig Hauser","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Norway"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"One of the most prominent topics in climate research is the investigation, detection, and allocation of climate change. In this paper, we aim at identifying regions in the atmosphere (e.g., certain height layers) which can act as sensitive and robust indicators for climate change. We demonstrate how interactive visual data exploration of large amounts of multi-variate and time-dependent climate data enables the steered generation of promising hypotheses for subsequent statistical evaluation. The use of new visualization and interaction technology—in the context of a coordinated multiple views framework—allows not only to identify these promising hypotheses, but also to efficiently narrow down parameters that are required in the process of computational data analysis. Two datasets, namely an ECHAM5 climate model run and the ERA-40 reanalysis incorporating observational data, are investigated. Higher-order information such as linear trends or signal-to-noise ratio is derived and interactively explored in order to detect and explore those regions which react most sensitively to climate change.

The user explores the network by changing the focal node in the detailed view or by changing the level of detail of a node or cluster. For scalability, fast force-based layout algorithms are used for the overview and the detailed view. However, using the same layout algorithm in both views is problematic since layout for the detailed view has different requirements to that in the overview. Here we present a model in which constrained graph layout algorithms are used for layout in the detailed view. This means the detailed view has high-quality layout including sophisticated edge routing and is customisable by the user who can add placement constraints on the layout. Scalability is still ensured since the slower layout techniques are only applied to the small subgraph shown in the detailed view. The main technical innovations are techniques to ensure that the overview and detailed view remain synchronized, and modifying constrained graph layout algorithms to support smooth, stable layout. The key innovation supporting stability are new dynamic graph layout algorithms that preserve the topology or structure of the network when the user changes the focus node or the level of detail by in situ semantic zooming.

In this paper we describe a successful realization of a tightly coupled steering loop, integrating new simulation technology and interactive visual analysis in a prototyping environment for automotive industry system design. Due to increasing pressure on car manufacturers to meet new emission regulations, to improve efficiency, and to reduce noise, both simulation and visualization are pushed to their limits. Automotive system components, such as the powertrain system or the injection system have an increasing number of parameters, and new design approaches are required. It is no longer possible to optimize such a system solely based on experience or forward optimization. By coupling interactive visualization with the simulation back-end (computational steering), it is now possible to quickly prototype a new system, starting from a non-optimized initial prototype and the corresponding simulation model. The prototyping continues through the refinement of the simulation model, of the simulation parameters and through trial-and-error attempts to an optimized solution. The ability to early see the first results from a multidimensional simulation space — thousands of simulations are run for a multidimensional variety of input parameters — and to quickly go back into the simulation and request more runs in particular parameter regions of interest significantly improves the prototyping process and provides a deeper understanding of the system behavior. The excellent results which we achieved for the common rail injection system strongly suggest that our approach has a great potential of being generalized to other, similar scenarios.","article_number":"4658193","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658193","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658193/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658193/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"1699","end_page":"1706","citing_paper_count":39,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":505,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Prototypes","Rails","Virtual prototyping","Visualization","Computational modeling","Automotive engineering","Multidimensional systems","Analytical models","Manufacturing industries","System analysis and design"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—","interactive computational steering","interactive visual analysis","simulation","common rail injection system"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.160","title":"Revisiting Histograms and Isosurface Statistics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":43,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550809300","id":37550809300,"full_name":"Carlos E.

When zoomed out, local trends and anomalies become suppressed and lost; when zoomed in for local inspection, spatial awareness and comparison between regions become limited. In our model, coordinated visualizations are integrated within individual probe interfaces, which depict the local data in user-defined regions-of-interest. Our probe concept can be incorporated into a variety of geospatial visualizations to empower users with the ability to observe, coordinate, and compare data across multiple local regions. It is especially useful when dealing with complex simulations or analyses where behavior in various localities differs from other localities and from the system as a whole. We illustrate the effectiveness of our technique over traditional interfaces by incorporating it within three existing geospatial visualization systems: an agent-based social simulation, a census data exploration tool, and an 3D GIS environment for analyzing urban change over time. In each case, the probe-based interaction enhances spatial awareness, improves inspection and comparison capabilities, expands the range of scopes, and facilitates collaboration among multiple users.","article_number":"4658126","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658126","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658126/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658126/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"1165","end_page":"1172","citing_paper_count":33,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":622,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Probes"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—","Multiple-view techniques","geospatial visualization","geospatial analysis","focus + context","probes"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.161","title":"Sinus Endoscopy - Application of Advanced GPU Volume Rendering for Virtual Endoscopy","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":46,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Simulation and Graphics, Otto-von-Guericke-University of Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088413533","id":37088413533,"full_name":"Arno Kruger","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Simulation and Graphics, Otto-von-Guericke-University of Magdeburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Simulation and Graphics, Otto-von-Guericke-University of Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869714800","id":37869714800,"full_name":"Christoph Kubisch","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Simulation and Graphics, Otto-von-Guericke-University of Magdeburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"ENT Department, University Hospital of Leipzig","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37424645300","id":37424645300,"full_name":"Bernhard Preim","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["ENT Department, University Hospital of Leipzig"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Simulation and Graphics, Otto-von-Guericke-University of Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546436800","id":37546436800,"full_name":"Gero Strauss","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Simulation and Graphics, Otto-von-Guericke-University of Magdeburg, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"For difficult cases in endoscopic sinus surgery, a careful planning of the intervention is necessary. Due to the reduced field of view during the intervention, the surgeons have less information about the surrounding structures in the working area compared to open surgery. Virtual endoscopy enables the visualization of the operating field and additional information, such as risk structures (e.g., optical nerve and skull base) and target structures to be removed (e.g., mucosal swelling). The Sinus Endoscopy system provides the functional range of a virtual endoscopic system with special focus on a realistic representation. Furthermore, by using direct volume rendering, we avoid time-consuming segmentation steps for the use of individual patient datasets. However, the image quality of the endoscopic view can be adjusted in a way that a standard computer with a modern standard graphics card achieves interactive frame rates with low CPU utilization. Thereby, characteristics of the endoscopic view are systematically used for the optimization of the volume rendering speed. The system design was based on a careful analysis of the endoscopic sinus surgery and the resulting needs for computer support. As a small standalone application it can be instantly used for surgical planning and patient education. First results of a clinical evaluation with ENT surgeons were employed to fine-tune the user interface, in particular to reduce the number of controls by using appropriate default values wherever possible. The system was used for preoperative planning in 102 cases, provides useful information for intervention planning (e.g., anatomic variations of the Rec. Frontalis), and closely resembles the intraoperative situation.","article_number":"4658167","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658167","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658167/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658167/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"1491","end_page":"1498","citing_paper_count":33,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":575,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Endoscopes","Surgery","Rendering (computer graphics)","Visualization","Biomedical optical imaging","Skull","Image segmentation","Image quality","Computer graphics","System analysis and design"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—","medical visualization","sinus surgery","operationplanning","virtual endoscopy","volume rendering"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.132","title":"Focus+Context Visualization with Distortion Minimization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":47,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics Group/Visual System Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407536000","id":37407536000,"full_name":"Yu-Shuen Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics Group/Visual System Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics Group/Visual System Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37277268400","id":37277268400,"full_name":"Tong-Yee Lee","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics Group/Visual System Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37324166000","id":37324166000,"full_name":"Chiew-Lan Tai","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The need to examine and manipulate large surface models is commonly found in many science, engineering, and medical applications.

It is, therefore, desirable that visualization methods take into account the entire multi-field volume data rather than concentrating on one variable. We present a visualization approach based on surface extraction from multi-field particle volume data. The surfaces segment the data with respect to the underlying multi-variate function. Decisions on segmentation properties are based on the analysis of the multi-dimensional feature space. The feature space exploration is performed by an automated multi-dimensional hierarchical clustering method, whose resulting density clusters are shown in the form of density level sets in a 3D star coordinate layout. In the star coordinate layout, the user can select clusters of interest. A selected cluster in feature space corresponds to a segmenting surface in object space. Based on the segmentation property induced by the cluster membership, we extract a surface from the volume data. Our driving applications are smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations, where each particle carries multiple properties. The data sets are given in the form of unstructured point-based volume data. We directly extract our surfaces from such data without prior resampling or grid generation. The surface extraction computes individual points on the surface, which is supported by an efficient neighborhood computation. The extracted surface points are rendered using point-based rendering operations. Our approach combines methods in scientific visualization for object-space operations with methods in information visualization for feature-space operations.","article_number":"4658166","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658166","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658166/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658166/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"1483","end_page":"1490","citing_paper_count":31,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":670,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data mining","Data visualization","Hydrodynamics","Computational modeling","Astrophysics","Interpolation","Sampling methods","Space exploration","Clustering methods","Level set"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—","Multi-field and multi-variate visualization","isosurfaces and surface extraction","point-based visualization","star coordinates","visualization in astrophysics","particle simulations."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.178","title":"Vispedia: Interactive Visual Exploration of Wikipedia Data via Search-Based Integration","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":50,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Stanford, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37876908500","id":37876908500,"full_name":"Bryan Chan","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stanford, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stanford, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37877444800","id":37877444800,"full_name":"Leslie Wu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stanford, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stanford, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604514900","id":37604514900,"full_name":"Justin Talbot","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stanford, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stanford, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37870000300","id":37870000300,"full_name":"Mike Cammarano","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stanford, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stanford, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349803800","id":37349803800,"full_name":"Pat Hanrahan","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stanford, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Wikipedia is an example of the collaborative, semi-structured data sets emerging on the Web.

We applied visualization techniques that provide shape cues as well as depth cues to allow the viewer to differentiate between vessels that are closer from those that are farther. We use our computed vesselness coefficient to effectively visualize vasculature in both clinical neurovascular x-ray computed tomography based angiography images, as well as images from three different animal studies.

Through the novel geodesic distance-weighted shape vector image diffusion presented in this paper, we can create a multiscale diffusion space, in which the cross-scale extrema can be detected as the robust geometric features for the matching and registration of surfaces. Therefore, statistical analysis and visualization of surface properties across subjects become readily available.

Since the texture resolution is independent of the volume resolution, this technique allows structure-aligned textures containing appearance properties or textual information to be used for volume augmentation and annotation.","article_number":"4658154","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658154","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658154/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658154/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"1388","end_page":"1395","citing_paper_count":28,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":458,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Brushes","Painting","Graphics","Data visualization","Paints","Filling","Buildings","Biomedical imaging","Engineering in medicine and biology"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—","Volume editing","GPU","painting","carving","annotations"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.115","title":"Box Spline Reconstruction On The Face-Centered Cubic Lattice","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":54,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"CISE Department, University of Florida, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37878688900","id":37878688900,"full_name":"Minho Kim","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["CISE Department, University of Florida, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"CISE Department, University of Florida, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268675600","id":37268675600,"full_name":"Alireza Entezari","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["CISE Department, University of Florida, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"CISE Department, University of Florida, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37288759800","id":37288759800,"full_name":"Jörg Peters","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["CISE Department, University of Florida, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We introduce and analyze an efficient reconstruction algorithm for FCC-sampled data.

However, the engineering of these devices is a highly demanding task. Advanced modeling methods and computer simulations allow the investigation of the fluid flow inside such a device and in particular of potential blood damage. In this paper we present a set of visualization methods which have been designed to specifically support the analysis of a tensor-based blood damage prediction model. This model is based on the tracing of particles through the VAD, for each of which the cumulative blood damage can be computed. The model's tensor output approximates a single blood cell's deformation in the flow field. The tensor and derived scalar data are subsequently visualized using techniques based on icons, particle visualization, and function plotting. All these techniques are accessible through a Virtual Reality-based user interface, which features not only stereoscopic rendering but also natural interaction with the complex three-dimensional data. To illustrate the effectiveness of these visualization methods, we present the results of an analysis session that was performed by domain experts for a specific data set for the MicroMed DeBakey VAD.","article_number":"4658170","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658170","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658170/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658170/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"1515","end_page":"1522","citing_paper_count":26,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":592,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Blood","Data visualization","Heart","Tensile stress","Humans","Degenerative diseases","Maintenance engineering","Biological system modeling","Computer simulation","Fluid flow"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—","Tensor visualization","time-dependent data","blood damage","ventricular assist device","virtual reality"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.144","title":"Interactive Visual Analysis of Set-Typed Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":57,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017008700","id":38017008700,"full_name":"Wolfgang Freiler","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VRVis Research Center Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37947312900","id":37947312900,"full_name":"Kresimir Matkovic","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VRVis Research Center Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Bergen in Norway, Norway","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274158800","id":37274158800,"full_name":"Helwig Hauser","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bergen in Norway, Norway"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"While it is quite typical to deal with attributes of different data types in the visualization of heterogeneous and multivariate datasets, most existing techniques still focus on the most usual data types such as numerical attributes or strings.

High level reasoning still resides in the human analyst, while part of the low level perception is handled by the computer.

Overhead video provides rich opportunities for long-term behavioral and occupancy analysis, but it poses considerable challenges. We present initial steps addressing two challenges.

In this paper, we present a seamless multi-focus and context technique, called Balloon Focus, that allows the user to smoothly enlarge multiple treemap items served as the foci, while maintaining a stable treemap layout as the context. Our method has several desirable features. First, this method is quite general and can be used with different treemap layout algorithms. Second, as the foci are enlarged, the relative positions among all items are preserved. Third, the foci are placed in a way that the remaining space is evenly distributed back to the non-focus treemap items. When Balloon Focus enlarges the focus items to a maximum degree, the above features ensure that the treemap will maintain a consistent appearance and avoid any abrupt layout changes. In our algorithm, a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) is used to maintain the positional constraints, and an elastic model is employed to govern the placement of the treemap items. We demonstrate a treemap visualization system that integrates data query, manual focus selection, and our novel multi-focus+context technique, Balloon Focus, together. A user study was conducted. Results show that with Balloon Focus, users can better perform the tasks of comparing the values and the distribution of the foci.","article_number":"4658125","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658125","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658125/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658125/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"1157","end_page":"1164","citing_paper_count":16,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":500,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Displays","Tree graphs","Computer science","Manuals","Large-scale systems","File systems","Telecommunication traffic","Navigation","Computer interfaces"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—","Treemap","focus+context","multi-focus","fisheye","magnification","visualizing query results","multi-scale viewing."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.136","title":"Glyph-Based SPECT Visualization for the Diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":63,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Visualization and Computer Graphics Research Group (VisCG), University of Münster, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38271045600","id":38271045600,"full_name":"Jennis Meyer-Spradow","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visualization and Computer Graphics Research Group (VisCG), University of Münster, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital of Münster, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273031400","id":37273031400,"full_name":"Lars Stegger","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital of Münster, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Visualization and Computer Graphics Research Group (VisCG), University of Münster, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089138838","id":37089138838,"full_name":"Christian Döring","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visualization and Computer Graphics Research Group (VisCG), University of Münster, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Visualization and Computer Graphics Research Group (VisCG), University of Münster, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295281400","id":37295281400,"full_name":"Timo Ropinski","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visualization and Computer Graphics Research Group (VisCG), University of Münster, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Visualization and Computer Graphics Research Group (VisCG), University of Münster, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267218300","id":37267218300,"full_name":"Klaus Hinrichs","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visualization and Computer Graphics Research Group (VisCG), University of Münster, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Myocardial perfusion imaging with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is an established method for the detection and evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD). State-of-the-art SPECT scanners yield a large number of regional parameters of the left-ventricular myocardium (e.g., blood supply at rest and during stress, wall thickness, and wall thickening during heart contraction) that all need to be assessed by the physician. Today, the individual parameters of this multivariate data set are displayed as stacks of 2D slices, bull's eye plots, or, more recently, surfaces in 3D, which depict the left-ventricular wall. In all these visualizations, the data sets are displayed side-by-side rather than in an integrated manner, such that the multivariate data have to be examined sequentially and need to be fused mentally. This is time consuming and error-prone. In this paper we present an interactive 3D glyph visualization, which enables an effective integrated visualization of the multivariate data. Results from semiotic theory are used to optimize the mapping of different variables to glyph properties. This facilitates an improved perception of important information and thus an accelerated diagnosis. The 3D glyphs are linked to the established 2D views, which permit a more detailed inspection, and to relevant meta-information such as known stenoses of coronary vessels supplying the myocardial region. Our method has demonstrated its potential for clinical routine use in real application scenarios assessed by nuclear physicians.","article_number":"4658168","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658168","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658168/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658168/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"1499","end_page":"1506","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":551,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Coronary arteriosclerosis","Myocardium","Blood","Stress","Data visualization","Arteries","Heart","Single photon emission computed tomography","Positron emission tomography","Acceleration"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—","Multivariate visualization","glyph techniques","SPECT","myocardial perfusion imaging"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.180","title":"Visualization of Myocardial Perfusion Derived from Coronary Anatomy","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":64,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Vienna University of Technology, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869997400","id":37869997400,"full_name":"Maurice Termeer","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Vienna University of Technology, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Philips Healthcare","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086889017","id":37086889017,"full_name":"Javier Oliván Bescós","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Philips Healthcare"]}},{"affiliation":"Philips Healthcare","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37374875300","id":37374875300,"full_name":"Marcel Breeuwer","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Philips Healthcare"]}},{"affiliation":"Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282551500","id":37282551500,"full_name":"Anna Vilanova","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands"]}},{"affiliation":"Philips Healthcare","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37374887400","id":37374887400,"full_name":"Frans Gerritsen","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Philips Healthcare"]}},{"affiliation":"Vienna University of Technology, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282552200","id":37282552200,"full_name":"M.

The results are subsequently visualized using both three-dimensional visualizations and bull’s eye plots, partially inspired by approaches currently common in medical practice. Our approach results in a comprehensive visualization of the coronary anatomy that compares well to visualizations commonly used for other scanning technologies. We demonstrate techniques giving detailed insight in blood supply, coronary territories and feeding coronary arteries of a selected region. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach through visualizations that show information which commonly cannot be directly observed in scanning data, such as a separate visualization of the supply from each coronary artery. We thus show that the results of a computational simulation can be effectively visualized and facilitate visually correlating these results to for example perfusion data.","article_number":"4658180","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658180","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658180/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658180/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"1595","end_page":"1602","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":50,"download_count":449,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Myocardium","Anatomy","Data visualization","Arteries","Computational modeling","Blood","Heart","Muscles","Coronary arteriosclerosis","Medical simulation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—","Cardiac visualization","coronary artery territories","myocardial perfusion"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.168","title":"Text Scaffolds for Effective Surface Labeling","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":65,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37882969500","id":37882969500,"full_name":"Gregory Cipriano","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282585700","id":37282585700,"full_name":"Michael Gleicher","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this paper we introduce a technique for applying textual labels to 3D surfaces. An effective labeling must balance the conflicting goals of conveying the shape of the surface while being legible from a range of viewing directions. Shape can be conveyed by placing the text as a texture directly on the surface, providing shape cues, meaningful landmarks and minimally obstructing the rest of the model. But rendering such surface text is problematic both in regions of high curvature, where text would be warped, and in highly occluded regions, where it would be hidden. Our approach achieves both labeling goals by applying surface labels to a ’text scaffold’, a surface explicitly constructed to hold the labels. Text scaffolds conform to the underlying surface whenever possible, but can also float above problem regions, allowing them to be smooth while still conveying the overall shape. This paper provides methods for constructing scaffolds from a variety of input sources, including meshes, constructive solid geometry, and scalar fields. These sources are first mapped into a distance transform, which is then filtered and used to construct a new mesh on which labels are either manually or automatically placed. In the latter case, annotated regions of the input surface are associated with proximal regions on the new mesh, and labels placed using cartographic principles.","article_number":"4658190","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658190","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658190/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658190/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"1675","end_page":"1682","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":263,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Labeling","Shape","Rough surfaces","Surface roughness","Surface texture","Solids","Geometry","Art","Visualization","Three dimensional displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—","surface labeling","computational cartography","text authoring","annotation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.108","title":"A Comparison of the Perceptual Benefits of Linear Perspective and Physically-Based Illumination for Display of Dense 3D Streamtubes","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":66,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"UT/ORNL Joint Institiute for Computational Sciences, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282585600","id":37282585600,"full_name":"Chris Weigle","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UT/ORNL Joint Institiute for Computational Sciences, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"UT/ORNL Joint Institiute for Computational Sciences, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37356983700","id":37356983700,"full_name":"David Banks","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UT/ORNL Joint Institiute for Computational Sciences, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Large datasets typically contain coarse features comprised of finer sub-features. Even if the shapes of the small structures are evident in a 3D display, the aggregate shapes they suggest may not be easily inferred. From previous studies in shape perception, the evidence has not been clear whether physically-based illumination confers any advantage over local illumination for understanding scenes that arise in visualization of large data sets that contain features at two distinct scales. In this paper we show that physically-based illumination can improve the perception for some static scenes of complex 3D geometry from flow fields. We perform human-subjects experiments to quantify the effect of physically-based illumination on participant performance for two tasks: selecting the closer of two streamtubes from a field of tubes, and identifying the shape of the domain of a flow field over different densities of tubes. We find that physically-based illumination influences participant performance as strongly as perspective projection, suggesting that physically-based illumination is indeed a strong cue to the layout of complex scenes. We also find that increasing the density of tubes for the shape identification task improved participant performance under physically-based illumination but not under the traditional hardware-accelerated illumination model.","article_number":"4658196","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658196","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658196/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658196/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"1723","end_page":"1730","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":346,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Lighting","Three dimensional displays","Shape","Layout","Data visualization","Humans","Visual system","Psychology","Aggregates","Geometry"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—","user study","volume completion","3D shape perception","physically-based illumination","global illumination","local illumination","multi-scale visualization","flow visualization","streamtubes","DT-MRI","white matter tractography"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.179","title":"Visualization of Cellular and Microvascular Relationships","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":67,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Texas A and M University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282589200","id":37282589200,"full_name":"David Mayerich","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Texas A and M University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Veterinary Integrative Biosciences, Texas A and M University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37884259000","id":37884259000,"full_name":"Louise Abbott","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Veterinary Integrative Biosciences, Texas A and M University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Texas A and M University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282588300","id":37282588300,"full_name":"John Keyser","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Texas A and M University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Understanding the structure of microvasculature structures and their relationship to cells in biological tissue is an important and complex problem.

Due to recent advances in microscopy, large volumes of data can be imaged at the resolution necessary to reconstruct these structures. Due to the dense and complex nature of microscopy data sets, it is important to limit the amount of information displayed. In this paper, we describe methods for encoding the unique structure of microvascular data, allowing researchers to selectively explore microvascular anatomy.

Existing approaches operate on gridded data and mainly on regular structured grids. When considering unstructured point-based volume data where sample points do not form regular patterns nor are they connected in any form, one would typically resample the data over a grid prior to applying the known PDE-based methods. As resampling inserts interpolation inaccuracies, data providers would rather have segmentation methods operate on the actual unstructured data. We propose an approach that directly extracts smooth surfaces from unstructured point-based volume data without prior resampling or mesh generation.When operating on unstructured data one needs to quickly derive neighborhood informations. The respective information is retrieved by partitioning the 3D domain into cells using a kd-tree and operating on its cells. We exploit neighborhood information to estimate gradients and mean curvature at every sample point using a four-dimensional least-squares fitting approach. Gradients and mean curvature are required for applying the chosen PDE-based method that combines hyperbolic advection to an isovalue of a given scalar field and mean curvature flow. Since we are using an explicit time-integration scheme, time steps are bounded by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition. To avoid small global time steps, we use asynchronous local integration. We extract the surface by successively fitting a smooth function to the data set. This function is initialized with a signed distance function. For each sample and for every time step we compute the respective gradient, the mean curvature, and a stable time step. With these informations the function is manipulated using an explicit Euler time integration. The process continues with the next sample point in time.

The results of two separate user studies suggest that our interface lowers the learning curve for naive users, while still providing enough analytical power to discover interesting correlations in the data.","article_number":"4658130","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658130","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658130/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658130/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"1197","end_page":"1204","citing_paper_count":12,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":389,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Voting","Database languages","Data visualization","Data analysis","Nominations and elections","Demography","Computer graphics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—","Visual query languages","radial visualization","data analysis","human-computer interaction"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.126","title":"Effects of Video Placement and Spatial Context Presentation on Path Reconstruction Tasks with Contextualized Videos","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":70,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601156200","id":37601156200,"full_name":"Yi Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virginia Tech"]}},{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282977600","id":37282977600,"full_name":"Doug Bowman","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virginia Tech"]}},{"affiliation":"Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37391946800","id":37391946800,"full_name":"David Krum","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center","Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center"]}},{"affiliation":"Bosch RTC","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088672734","id":37088672734,"full_name":"Enylton Coalho","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Bosch RTC"]}},{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38270396300","id":38270396300,"full_name":"Tonya Smith-Jackson","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virginia Tech"]}},{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088672911","id":37088672911,"full_name":"David Bailey","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virginia Tech"]}},{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37876923500","id":37876923500,"full_name":"Sarah Peck","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virginia Tech"]}},{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088673213","id":37088673213,"full_name":"Swethan Anand","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virginia Tech"]}},{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088672752","id":37088672752,"full_name":"Trevor Kennedy","author_order":9,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virginia Tech"]}},{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088674042","id":37088674042,"full_name":"Yernar Abdrazakov","author_order":10,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virginia Tech"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Many interesting and promising prototypes for visualizing video data have been proposed, including those that combine videos with their spatial context (contextualized videos).

Research on volume exploration has been focused on revealing hidden structures in volumetric data. While the information of individual structures or features is useful in practice, spatial relations between structures are also important in many applications and can provide further insights into the data. In this paper, we systematically study the extraction, representation,exploration, and visualization of spatial relations in volumetric data and propose a novel relation-aware visualization pipeline for volume exploration. In our pipeline, various relations in the volume are first defined and measured using region connection calculus (RCC) and then represented using a graph interface called relation graph. With RCC and the relation graph, relation query and interactive exploration can be conducted in a comprehensive and intuitive way. The visualization process is further assisted with relation-revealing viewpoint selection and color and opacity enhancement. We also introduce a quality assessment scheme which evaluates the perception of spatial relations in the rendered images. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the practical use of our system in exploratory visualization.","article_number":"4658191","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658191","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658191/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658191/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"1683","end_page":"1690","citing_paper_count":11,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":253,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Pipelines","Rendering (computer graphics)","Data visualization","Data mining","Volume measurement","Calculus","Color","Quality assessment","Data acquisition","Analytical models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—","Exploratory Visualization","Relation-Based Visualization","Visualization Pipeline."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.182","title":"Visualizing Multiwavelength Astrophysical Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":72,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37881121400","id":37881121400,"full_name":"Hongwei Li","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Nanyang Technological University, Singapore","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37336329800","id":37336329800,"full_name":"Chi-Wing Fu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"]}},{"affiliation":"Indiana University, Bloomington, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37333439100","id":37333439100,"full_name":"Andrew Hanson","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Indiana University, Bloomington, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"With recent advances in the measurement technology for allsky astrophysical imaging, our view of the sky is no longer limited to the tiny visible spectral range over the 2D Celestial sphere.

In this work we present a new classification of MC cases that we call edge groups, which helps elucidate the issues that impact the triangle quality of the meshes that the method generates. This formulation allows a more systematic way to bound the triangle quality, and is general enough to extend to other polyhedral cell shapes used in other polygonization algorithms. Using this analysis, we also discuss ways to improve the quality of the resulting triangle mesh, including some that require only minor modifications of the original algorithm.","article_number":"4658187","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658187","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658187/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658187/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"1651","end_page":"1666","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":325,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Isosurfaces","Robustness","Mesh generation","Shape","Algorithm design and analysis","Proposals","Mathematics","Computational modeling","Pressing","Scientific computing"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—","Isosurface extraction","Marching Cubes"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.124","title":"Effective Visualization of Short Routes","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":74,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics Group, University of Bonn, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37870005900","id":37870005900,"full_name":"Patrick Degener","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics Group, University of Bonn, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics Group, University of Bonn, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37867979100","id":37867979100,"full_name":"Ruwen Schnabel","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics Group, University of Bonn, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics Group, University of Bonn, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37719871100","id":37719871100,"full_name":"Christopher Schwartz","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics Group, University of Bonn, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics Group, University of Bonn, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271619700","id":37271619700,"full_name":"Reinhard Klein","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics Group, University of Bonn, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this work we develop a new alternative to conventional maps for visualization of relatively short paths as they are frequently encountered in hotels, resorts or museums.

One of the most interesting models which came up with Einstein's theory was developed by Kurt Godel in 1949. The Godel universe is a valid solution of Einstein's field equations, making it a possible physical description of our universe. It offers remarkable features like the existence of an optical horizon beyond which time travel is possible. Although we know that our universe is not a Godel universe, it is interesting to visualize physical aspects of a world model resulting from a theory which is highly confirmed in scientific history. Standard techniques to adopt an egocentric point of view in a relativistic world model have shortcomings with respect to the time needed to render an image as well as difficulties in applying a direct illumination model. In this paper we want to face both issues to reduce the gap between common visualization standards and relativistic visualization. We will introduce two techniques to speed up recalculation of images by means of preprocessing and lookup tables and to increase image quality through a special optimization applicable to the Godel universe. The first technique allows the physicist to understand the different effects of general relativity faster and better by generating images from existing datasets interactively. By using the intrinsic symmetries of Godel's spacetime which are expressed by the Killing vector field, we are able to reduce the necessary calculations to simple cases using the second technique. This even makes it feasible to account for a direct illumination model during the rendering process. Although the presented methods are applied to Godel's universe, they can also be extended to other manifolds, for example light propagation in moving dielectric media. Therefore, other areas of research can benefit from these generic improvements.","article_number":"4658176","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658176","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658176/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658176/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"1563","end_page":"1570","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":414,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Rendering (computer graphics)","Lighting","Equations","History","Table lookup","Image quality","Image generation","Optical propagation","Dielectrics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—","General relativity","Gödel universe","nonlinear ray tracing","time travel."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.146","title":"Interactive Visualization and Analysis of Transitional Flow","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":76,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Texas Advanced Computing Center, The University of Texas, Austin","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37269399700","id":37269399700,"full_name":"Gregory P.

Although researchers have developed many data transformation techniques, there is little empirical study of the general impact of data transformation on visualization. Without such study, it is difficult to systematically decide when and which data transformation techniques are needed. We thus have designed and conducted a two-part empirical study that examines how the use of common data transformation techniques impacts visualization quality, which in turn affects user task performance. Our first experiment studies the impact of data transformation on user performance in single-step, typical visual analytic tasks. The second experiment assesses the impact of data transformation in multi-step analytic tasks. Our results quantify the benefits of data transformation in both experiments. More importantly, our analyses reveal that (1) the benefits of data transformation vary significantly by task and by visualization, and (2) the use of data transformation depends on a user's interaction context. Based on our findings, we present a set of design recommendations that help guide the development and use of data transformation techniques.","article_number":"4658144","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658144","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658144/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658144/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"1309","end_page":"1316","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1018,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Cleaning","Sampling methods","Visual analytics","Data analysis","Design methodology","Data mining","Man machine systems"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—","data transformation","data cleaning","empirical evaluation","user studies"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.176","title":"Visibility-driven Mesh Analysis and Visualization through Graph Cuts","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":78,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"NVIDIA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37873595500","id":37873595500,"full_name":"Kaichi Zhou","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["NVIDIA","Arizona State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Oregon State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37398562200","id":37398562200,"full_name":"Eugene Zhang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oregon State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085784832","id":37085784832,"full_name":"Jiˇr´ı Bittner","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic"]}},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38514733100","id":38514733100,"full_name":"Peter Wonka","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this paper we present an algorithm that operates on a triangular mesh and classifies each face of a triangle as either inside or outside. We present three example applications of this core algorithm: normal orientation, inside removal, and layer-based visualization. The distinguishing feature of our algorithm is its robustness even if a difficult input model that includes holes, coplanar triangles, intersecting triangles, and lost connectivity is given. Our algorithm works with the original triangles of the input model and uses sampling to construct a visibility graph that is then segmented using graph cut.","article_number":"4658189","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658189","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658189/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658189/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"1667","end_page":"1674","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":7,"download_count":305,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Electronic mail","Face detection","Robustness","Sampling methods","Solid modeling","Geometry","Iterative algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Surface cracks"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—","Interior/Exterior Classification","Normal Orientation","Layer Classification","Inside Removal","Graph Cut"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.113","title":"Back matter","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":79,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Back matter from Vis/InfoVis 2008","article_number":"4658201","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658201","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658201/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658201/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"xxvii","end_page":"xxviii","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":87,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.156","title":"PrePages","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":80,"volume":"14","authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Prepages from Vis/InfoVis 2008","article_number":"4658122","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658122","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658122/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658122/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4658121,"publication_year":2008,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2008","start_page":"i","end_page":"xxv","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":402,"insert_date":"20081024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Conference proceedings"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Index Terms—"]}}}]}
