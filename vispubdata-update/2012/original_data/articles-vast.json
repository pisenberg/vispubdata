In addition to stable traits such as locus of control, research in psychology has found that temporary changes in affect (emotion) can significantly impact individual performance on cognitive tasks. We examine the relationship between fundamental visual judgement tasks and affect through a crowdsourced user study that combines affective-priming techniques from psychology with longstanding graphical perception experiments. Our results suggest that affective-priming can significantly influence accuracy in visual judgements, and that some chart types may be more affected than others.","article_number":"6400540","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400540","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400540/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400540/","publication_title":"2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Seattle, WA, USA","conference_dates":"14-19 Oct. 2012","publication_number":6381601,"is_number":6400483,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"14-19 Oct. 2012","start_page":"227","end_page":"228","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":401,"insert_date":"20130103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Psychology","Visual analytics","Human factors","Accuracy","Humans","Atmospheric measurements"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Judgment","Psychological Research","Locus Of Control","Sense Of Control","Crowdsourcing","Changes In Affect","Individual Differences In Personality","Affective Priming","Chart Types","Cognitive Function","Cognitive Performance","Cognitive Skills","Cognitive Abilities","Usability","Ease Of Use","Visual Analysis","Negative Group","Positive Group","Primary Group","Mechanical Turk","Self-Assessment Manikin"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4752-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4753-2","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2012.6400537","title":"A generic model for the integration of interactive visualization and statistical computing using R","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-4752-5","partnum":"12EX7700","rank":3,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546620000","id":37546620000,"full_name":"Johannes Kehrer","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Dept. of Statistics and Probability Theory, Vienna University of Technology, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086788302","id":37086788302,"full_name":"Roland N.

Thus, it is difficult for analysts to process and understand this overwhelming amount of data. In the specific case of time series data another problem arises: time series can be highly interrelated. This problem becomes even more challenging when a set of parameters influences the progression of a time series. However, while most visual analysis techniques support the analysis of short time periods, e.g. one day or one week, they fail to visualize large-scale time series, ranging over one year or more. In our approach we present a time series matrix visualization that tackles this problem. Its primary advantages are that it scales to a large number of time series with different start and end points and allows for the visual comparison / correlation analysis of a set of influencing factors. To evaluate our approach, we applied our technique to a real-world data set, showing the impact of local weather conditions on the efficiency of photovoltaic power plants.","article_number":"6400549","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400549","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400549/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400549/","publication_title":"2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Seattle, WA, USA","conference_dates":"14-19 Oct. 2012","publication_number":6381601,"is_number":6400483,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"14-19 Oct. 2012","start_page":"209","end_page":"210","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":453,"insert_date":"20130103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Time series analysis","Correlation","Temperature measurement","Meteorology","Substations","Visualization","Power generation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval Design Tools and Techniques]: Information filtering —"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Time Series Data","Visual Analysis","Large Time-series Data","Time Series","Power Plants","Real-world Datasets","Photovoltaic Power","Solar Power Plants","Solar Farms","Photovoltaic Farm","Photovoltaic Power Stations","Photovoltaic Power Plants","Photovoltaic Plant","Solar Park","Wide Variety Of Domains","Power Grid","Color Map","Power Production","Matrix Representation","Triangular Matrix","Triangular Matrices","Triangular Form","Time Series Dataset","Sunshine Duration","Correlation Of Time Series","Time-series Correlation","Weather Parameters","Zoom Level","Interval Time Series"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4752-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4753-2","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2012.6400516","title":"NetSecRadar: A real-time visualization system for network security - VAST 2012 Mini Challenge.

While these results are compelling and have direct implications to visualization design, the relationship between a user's LOC measure and their performance is not well understood. We hypothesize that there is a dependent relationship between LOC and performance; specifically, a person's orientation on the LOC scale directly influences their performance when learning new visualizations. To test this hypothesis, we conduct an experiment with 300 subjects using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. We adapt techniques from personality psychology to manipulate a user's LOC so that users are either primed to be more internally or externally oriented on the LOC scale. Replicating previous studies investigating the effect of LOC on performance, we measure users' speed and accuracy as they use visualizations with varying visual metaphors. Our findings demonstrate that changing a user's LOC impacts their performance. We find that a change in users' LOC results in performance changes.","article_number":"6400535","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400535","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400535/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400535/","publication_title":"2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Seattle, WA, USA","conference_dates":"14-19 Oct. 2012","publication_number":6381601,"is_number":6400483,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"14-19 Oct. 2012","start_page":"237","end_page":"238","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":261,"insert_date":"20130103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Layout","Educational institutions","Psychology","Electronic mail","Visual analytics","Marine vehicles"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Locus Of Control","Sense Of Control","Personality Traits","Dependent Relationship","Changes In Usage","Personality Psychology","Personal Theories","Visual Design","Visual Metaphors","Cognitive Processes","Mental Processes","Visual Task","Primary Group","Nest Boxes","Frame Of Mind"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4752-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4753-2","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2012.6400539","title":"Visualizing flows of images in social media","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-4752-5","partnum":"12EX7700","rank":17,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37534010200","id":37534010200,"full_name":"Masahiko Itoh","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37328454400","id":37328454400,"full_name":"Masashi Toyoda","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo"]}},{"affiliation":"Rakuten, Inc.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086712950","id":37086712950,"full_name":"Tetsuya Kamijo","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Rakuten, Inc."]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283954000","id":37283954000,"full_name":"Masaru Kitsuregawa","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Mass and social media provide flows of images for real world events. It is sometimes difficult to represent realities and impressions of events using only text. However, even a single photo might remind us complex events. Along with events in the real world, there are representative images, such as design of products and commercial pictures. We can therefore recognize changes in trends of people's ideas, experiences, and interests through observing the flows of such representative images. This paper presents a novel 3D visualization system to explore temporal changes in trends using images associating with different topics, called Image Bricks. We show case studies using images extracted from our six-year blog archive. We first extract clusters of images as topics related to given keywords. We then visualize them on multiple timelines in a 3D space. Users can visually read stories of topics through exploring visualized images.","article_number":"6400539","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400539","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400539/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400539/","publication_title":"2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Seattle, WA, USA","conference_dates":"14-19 Oct. 2012","publication_number":6381601,"is_number":6400483,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"14-19 Oct. 2012","start_page":"229","end_page":"230","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":335,"insert_date":"20130103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Market research","Blogs","Media","Timing","Histograms","Feature extraction"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Social Media","Social Platforms","Image Flow","Social Media Images","Change Trend","Temporal Changes","3D Space","3-dimensional Space","3D Visualization","Real-world Effectiveness","Real-world Consequences","Real-world Events","Single Photograph","Single Photo","Idea Of People","Time Window","News Content","Image Histogram","Grayscale Histogram"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4752-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4753-2","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2012.6400551","title":"Information retrieval failure analysis: Visual analytics as a support for interactive “what-if” investigation","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-4752-5","partnum":"12EX7700","rank":18,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Sapienza University of Roma, Italy","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085708091","id":37085708091,"full_name":"Marco Angelini","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sapienza University of Roma, Italy"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Padua, Italy","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295403100","id":37295403100,"full_name":"Nicola Ferro","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Padua, Italy"]}},{"affiliation":"Sapienza University of Roma, Italy","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086772995","id":37086772995,"full_name":"Guido Granato","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sapienza University of Roma, Italy"]}},{"affiliation":"Sapienza University of Roma, Italy","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283308300","id":37283308300,"full_name":"Guiseppe Santucci","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sapienza University of Roma, Italy"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Padua, Italy","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38111489700","id":38111489700,"full_name":"Gianmaria Silvello","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Padua, Italy"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"This poster provides an analytical model for examining performances of IR systems, based on the discounted cumulative gain family of metrics, and visualization for interacting and exploring the performances of the system under examination.

To explore CPS data and obtain actionable insights, we construct a Radial Pixel Visualization (RPV) system, which uses multiple concentric rings to show the data in a compact circular layout of small polygons (pixel cells), each of which represents an individual data value. RPV provides an effective visual representation of locality and periodicity of the high volume, multivariate data streams, and seamlessly combines them with the results of an automated analysis. In the outermost ring the results of correlation analysis and peak point detection are highlighted. Our explorations demonstrates how RPV can help administrators to identify periodic thermal hot spots, understand data center energy consumption, and optimize IT workload.","article_number":"6400541","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400541","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400541/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400541/","publication_title":"2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Seattle, WA, USA","conference_dates":"14-19 Oct. 2012","publication_number":6381601,"is_number":6400483,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"14-19 Oct. 2012","start_page":"225","end_page":"226","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":249,"insert_date":"20130103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Buildings","Servers","Correlation","Temperature sensors","Temperature measurement","Energy consumption"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Radial pixel visualization","cyber physical system","correlations","peaks","time-series data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Streams","Large Amount Of Data","Data Center","Peak Point","Multiple Rings","Smart Buildings","Outermost Ring","Outmost Ring","Circular Layout","Power Consumption"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4752-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4753-2","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2012.6400504","title":"Irregular Trend Finder: Visualization tool for analyzing time-series big data","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-4752-5","partnum":"12EX7700","rank":20,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Tsukuba, Japan","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086728439","id":37086728439,"full_name":"Shinnosuke Takeda","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Tsukuba, Japan"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Tsukuba, Japan","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38474212400","id":38474212400,"full_name":"Aimi Kobayashi","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Tsukuba, Japan"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Tsukuba, Japan","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085342309","id":37085342309,"full_name":"Hiroaki Kobayashi","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Tsukuba, Japan"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Tsukuba, Japan","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086672926","id":37086672926,"full_name":"Saori Okubo","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Tsukuba, Japan"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Tsukuba, Japan","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37370700600","id":37370700600,"full_name":"Kazuo Misue","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Tsukuba, Japan"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"We created a visualization tool called Irregular Trend Finder (ITF) for the VAST Challenge 2012 Mini Challenge 1.

Research into visual analytics tools to support the discovery of patterns in event data often focuses on the spatiotemporal or spatiomultivariate dimension of the data only. Few research efforts focus on all three dimensions in one framework. An integral view on all three dimensions is, however, required to unlock the full potential of event datasets. In this poster, we present an event visualization, transition, and interaction framework that enables an integral view on all dimensions of spatiotemporal multivariate event data. The framework is built around the notion that the event data space can be considered a spatiotemporal multivariate hypercube. Results of a case study we performed suggest that a visual analytics tool based on the proposed framework is indeed capable to support users in the discovery of multidimensional spatiotemporal multivariate patterns in event data.","article_number":"6400536","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400536","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400536/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400536/","publication_title":"2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Seattle, WA, USA","conference_dates":"14-19 Oct. 2012","publication_number":6381601,"is_number":6400483,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"14-19 Oct. 2012","start_page":"235","end_page":"236","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":196,"insert_date":"20130103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Spatiotemporal phenomena","Data visualization","Visual analytics","Hypercubes","Intelligent systems","Educational institutions","Abstracts"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Coordinated and multiple views","Visual knowledge discovery","Field studies","Multidimensional data","Visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Event Data","Effective Data","Patterns In Data","Spatial Patterns","Spatiotemporal Patterns","Temporal Patterns","Visual Analysis","Dimensional Data","Multivariate Data","Multivariate Statistics","Visualization Tool","Interesting Patterns","Pattern Of Involvement","Spatiotemporal Data","Interactive Framework","Integrative View","Spatiotemporal Effects","Spatiotemporal Events","Visual Framework","Visual Analytics Tool","Time And Space","Spacetime","Temporal Dimension","Time Dimension","Temporal Properties","Distribution Of Effects","Distribution Of Events","Spatial Dimensions","Spatial Attributes","Filtration Performance","Filtering Operation","Time Slice","Traffic Events","Traffic Effects"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4752-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4753-2","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2012.6400542","title":"Incorporating GOMS analysis into the design of an EEG data visual analysis tool","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-4752-5","partnum":"12EX7700","rank":25,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Brown University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489241200","id":38489241200,"full_name":"Hua Guo","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Brown University"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Brown University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086743819","id":37086743819,"full_name":"Diem Tran","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Brown University"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Brown University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275712600","id":37275712600,"full_name":"David H.

Using data from London's bike share scheme1, customer level classifications will be created, which consider the regularity of scheme use, journey length and travel times. Monitoring customer usage over time, user classifications will attend to the dynamics of cycling behaviour, asking substantive questions about how behaviours change under varying conditions.

This work is the first part of a three-year PhD project aimed at producing a pedestrian-routing system that can suggest attractive pathways extracted from user-generated photographic content.","article_number":"6400538","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400538","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400538/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400538/","publication_title":"2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Seattle, WA, USA","conference_dates":"14-19 Oct. 2012","publication_number":6381601,"is_number":6400483,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"14-19 Oct. 2012","start_page":"231","end_page":"232","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":155,"insert_date":"20130103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Cities and towns","Educational institutions","User-generated content","Semantics","Electronic mail","USA Councils"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Photo-sharing","Image Sharing","User-generated Content","User-generated","Data Filtering"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4752-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4753-2","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2012.6400505","title":"Federating geovisual analytic tools for cyber security analysis","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-4752-5","partnum":"12EX7700","rank":32,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"College of Information Sciences and Technology, The Pennsylvania State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085497959","id":37085497959,"full_name":"Mingyi Zhao","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Information Sciences and Technology, The Pennsylvania State University"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Information Sciences and Technology, The Pennsylvania State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37072781300","id":37072781300,"full_name":"Chen Zhong","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Information Sciences and Technology, The Pennsylvania State University"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Information Sciences and Technology, The Pennsylvania State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086759570","id":37086759570,"full_name":"Richard Ciamaichelo","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Information Sciences and Technology, The Pennsylvania State University"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Information Sciences and Technology, The Pennsylvania State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086757279","id":37086757279,"full_name":"Michael Konek","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Information Sciences and Technology, The Pennsylvania State University"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Information Sciences and Technology, The Pennsylvania State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37072995000","id":37072995000,"full_name":"Neela Sawant","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Information Sciences and Technology, The Pennsylvania State University"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Information Sciences and Technology, The Pennsylvania State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37595223800","id":37595223800,"full_name":"Nicklaus A.

We also present optimization techniques to improve the traversal speed of our structure through locational codes and bitwise comparisons. Finally, we present the results of an experiment that quantitatively evaluates our modified SPT tree with and without our optimizations. Our results indicate that retrieval was nearly three times faster when using our optimizations, and are consistent across multiple trials.

Such spatiotemporal data has immense value for increasing situational awareness of local events, providing insights for investigations and understanding the extent of incidents, their severity, and consequences, as well as their time-evolving nature. In analyzing social media data, researchers have mainly focused on finding temporal trends according to volume-based importance. Hence, a relatively small volume of relevant messages may easily be obscured by a huge data set indicating normal situations. In this paper, we present a visual analytics approach that provides users with scalable and interactive social media data analysis and visualization including the exploration and examination of abnormal topics and events within various social media data sources, such as Twitter, Flickr and YouTube. In order to find and understand abnormal events, the analyst can first extract major topics from a set of selected messages and rank them probabilistically using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. He can then apply seasonal trend decomposition together with traditional control chart methods to find unusual peaks and outliers within topic time series. Our case studies show that situational awareness can be improved by incorporating the anomaly and trend examination techniques into a highly interactive visual analysis process.","article_number":"6400557","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400557","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400557/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400557/","publication_title":"2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Seattle, WA, USA","conference_dates":"14-19 Oct. 2012","publication_number":6381601,"is_number":6400483,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"14-19 Oct. 2012","start_page":"143","end_page":"152","citing_paper_count":158,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":3137,"insert_date":"20130103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Media","Twitter","Time series analysis","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Data mining","Educational institutions","Earthquakes"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: User Interfaces — GUI","H.3.3 [Information Storage and Retrieval]","Information Search and Retrieval — Information filtering","relevance feedback"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Social Media","Social Platforms","Event Detection","Social Media Data","Social Media Analytics","Detection Of Abnormalities","Abnormal Events","Abnormal Effects","Seasonal-trend Decomposition","Abnormal Event Detection","Time Series","Interaction Analysis","Visual Analysis","Interactive Visualization","Situational Awareness","Spatiotemporal Data","Geolocated","Latent Dirichlet Allocation","Relevant Messages","Social Media Services","Standard Model","Spatial Information","Twitter Messages","Seasonal Component","Topic Modeling","Individual Messages","Probabilistic Model","Occupy Wall Street","Abrupt Events","Collection Of Papers","Document Collection","Twitter Data","Twitter Streaming"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4752-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4753-2","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2012.6400486","title":"Dis-function: Learning distance functions interactively","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-4752-5","partnum":"12EX7700","rank":39,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science Tufts University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38237586900","id":38237586900,"full_name":"Eli T.

Although machine learning offers algorithms for finding patterns in data automatically, they often require algorithm-specific parameters, such as an appropriate distance function, which are outside the purview of a domain expert. We present a system that allows an expert to interact directly with a visual representation of the data to define an appropriate distance function, thus avoiding direct manipulation of obtuse model parameters. Adopting an iterative approach, our system first assumes a uniformly weighted Euclidean distance function and projects the data into a two-dimensional scatterplot view. The user can then move incorrectly-positioned data points to locations that reflect his or her understanding of the similarity of those data points relative to the other data points. Based on this input, the system performs an optimization to learn a new distance function and then re-projects the data to redraw the scatter-plot. We illustrate empirically that with only a few iterations of interaction and optimization, a user can achieve a scatterplot view and its corresponding distance function that reflect the user's knowledge of the data. In addition, we evaluate our system to assess scalability in data size and data dimension, and show that our system is computationally efficient and can provide an interactive or near-interactive user experience.","article_number":"6400486","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400486","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400486/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400486/","publication_title":"2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Seattle, WA, USA","conference_dates":"14-19 Oct. 2012","publication_number":6381601,"is_number":6400483,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"14-19 Oct. 2012","start_page":"83","end_page":"92","citing_paper_count":126,"citing_patent_count":2,"download_count":1387,"insert_date":"20130103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Machine learning","Yttrium","Vectors","Bars","Euclidean distance"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Distance Function","Machine Learning","Direct Use","Direct Utilization","Direct Manipulation","Domain Experts","Cognitive Data","Knowledge Data","Euclidean Distance Function","Euclidean Distance Map","Two-dimensional Scatter Plot","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Bar Graphs","Number Of Data Points","Singular Value Decomposition","Project Data","Conjugate Gradient","Pair Of Points","Interactive Visualization","User Input","Set Of Data Points","Points In The Dataset","User Feedback","2D Projection","Expert Users","Dimensional Weight","Weight Of Each Dimension","Machine Learning Literature","Parallel Coordinates","Parallel Bars","Magnitude Of Weights","Principal Component Analysis Calculations","Scatter Plot Of Data","Scatterplots Of Data","Leave-one-out Cross-validation","Prototype","Machine Learning Techniques"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4752-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4753-2","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2012.6400485","title":"LeadLine: Interactive visual analysis of text data through event identification and exploration","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-4752-5","partnum":"12EX7700","rank":40,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina at Charlotte","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606064200","id":37606064200,"full_name":"Wenwen Dou","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of North Carolina at Charlotte"]}},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina at Charlotte","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601069300","id":37601069300,"full_name":"Xiaoyu Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of North Carolina at Charlotte"]}},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina at Charlotte","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086757018","id":37086757018,"full_name":"Drew Skau","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of North Carolina at Charlotte"]}},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina at Charlotte","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300425000","id":37300425000,"full_name":"William Ribarsky","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of North Carolina at Charlotte"]}},{"affiliation":"IBM Almaden Research Center","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399569300","id":37399569300,"full_name":"Michelle X.

Events are inherently temporal, evolving over time. Existing visual text analysis systems have provided temporal views of changes based on topical themes extracted from text data. But few have associated topical themes with events that cause the changes. In this paper, we propose an interactive visual analytics system, LeadLine, to automatically identify meaningful events in news and social media data and support exploration of the events. To characterize events, LeadLine integrates topic modeling, event detection, and named entity recognition techniques to automatically extract information regarding the investigative 4 Ws: who, what, when, and where for each event. To further support analysis of the text corpora through events, LeadLine allows users to interactively examine meaningful events using the 4 Ws to develop an understanding of how and why. Through representing large-scale text corpora in the form of meaningful events, LeadLine provides a concise summary of the corpora. LeadLine also supports the construction of simple narratives through the exploration of events. To demonstrate the efficacy of LeadLine in identifying events and supporting exploration, two case studies were conducted using news and social media data.","article_number":"6400485","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400485","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400485/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400485/","publication_title":"2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Seattle, WA, USA","conference_dates":"14-19 Oct. 2012","publication_number":6381601,"is_number":6400483,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"14-19 Oct. 2012","start_page":"93","end_page":"102","citing_paper_count":111,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2365,"insert_date":"20130103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Event detection","Lead","Data mining","Time series analysis","Twitter","Crawlers"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Text Data","Text Corpus","Interactive Visualization","Identification Of Events","Narrative","Social Media","Social Platforms","Event Detection","Topic Modeling","Social Media Data","Social Media Analytics","Named Entity Recognition","Entity Extraction","Thematic Topics","Topical Subject","Time Series","Twitter","Retweets","Temporal Dimension","Time Dimension","Temporal Properties","Knowledge Of Structure","Cognitive Structures","Data Preparation","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Temporal Information","News Articles","News Stories","Latent Dirichlet Allocation","Map View","Occupy Movement","Occupy Protests","Occupy Wall Street Movement","Subjective Information","Topic Information","Large-scale Movements","Topic Detection","Detection Of Subjects","Interactive Exploration","Collection Of Texts","Hellinger Distance","Entity Types"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4752-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4753-2","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2012.6400554","title":"Visual analytics for the big data era — A comparative review of state-of-the-art commercial systems","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-4752-5","partnum":"12EX7700","rank":41,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406066900","id":37406066900,"full_name":"Leishi Zhang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592880100","id":37592880100,"full_name":"Andreas Stoffel","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38551542600","id":38551542600,"full_name":"Michael Behrisch","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38579710900","id":38579710900,"full_name":"Sebastian Mittelstadt","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282557600","id":37282557600,"full_name":"Tobias Schreck","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Siemens AG","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087713304","id":37087713304,"full_name":"René Pompl","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Siemens AG"]}},{"affiliation":"Siemens AG","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086725010","id":37086725010,"full_name":"Stefan Weber","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Siemens AG"]}},{"affiliation":"Siemens AG","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086727068","id":37086727068,"full_name":"Holger Last","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Siemens AG"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","id":37283138700,"full_name":"Daniel Keim","author_order":9,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Visual analytics (VA) system development started in academic research institutions where novel visualization techniques and open source toolkits were developed. Simultaneously, small software companies, sometimes spin-offs from academic research institutions, built solutions for specific application domains. In recent years we observed the following trend: some small VA companies grew exponentially; at the same time some big software vendors such as IBM and SAP started to acquire successful VA companies and integrated the acquired VA components into their existing frameworks. Generally the application domains of VA systems have broadened substantially. This phenomenon is driven by the generation of more and more data of high volume and complexity, which leads to an increasing demand for VA solutions from many application domains. In this paper we survey a selection of state-of-the-art commercial VA frameworks, complementary to an existing survey on open source VA tools.

Currently many methods are available to analyze this type of data. So far, proposed automatic approaches include dimensionality reduction and cluster analysis, whereby visual-interactive methods aim to provide effective visual mappings to show, relate, and navigate HD data. Furthermore, almost all of these methods conduct the analysis from a singular perspective, meaning that they consider the data in either the original HD data space, or a reduced version thereof. Additionally, HD data spaces often consist of combined features that measure different properties, in which case the particular relationships between the various properties may not be clear to the analysts a priori since it can only be revealed if appropriate feature combinations (subspaces) of the data are taken into consideration. Considering just a single subspace is, however, often not sufficient since different subspaces may show complementary, conjointly, or contradicting relations between data items. Useful information may consequently remain embedded in sets of subspaces of a given HD input data space. Relying on the notion of subspaces, we propose a novel method for the visual analysis of HD data in which we employ an interestingness-guided subspace search algorithm to detect a candidate set of subspaces. Based on appropriately defined subspace similarity functions, we visualize the subspaces and provide navigation facilities to interactively explore large sets of subspaces. Our approach allows users to effectively compare and relate subspaces with respect to involved dimensions and clusters of objects. We apply our approach to synthetic and real data sets. We thereby demonstrate its support for understanding HD data from different perspectives, effectively yielding a more complete view on HD data.","article_number":"6400488","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400488","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400488/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400488/","publication_title":"2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Seattle, WA, USA","conference_dates":"14-19 Oct. 2012","publication_number":6381601,"is_number":6400483,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"14-19 Oct. 2012","start_page":"63","end_page":"72","citing_paper_count":56,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1378,"insert_date":"20130103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["High definition video","Algorithm design and analysis","Visualization","Clustering algorithms","Topology","Data visualization","Educational institutions"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["H.2.8 [Database Applications]: Data mining","H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: Selection process","I.3.3 [Picture/Image Generation]","Display algorithms"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Subspace Search","Search Algorithm","Visual Analysis","Data Space","High-dimensional Data Space","Hierarchical Clustering","Hierarchical Cluster Analysis","Group Data","Scatter Plot","Base Case","Cluster Structure","Clusters Of Points","Similar Topology","Agglomerative Clustering","Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering","Dimensional Datasets","Set Of Dimensions","High Redundancy","Traditional Clustering","Hierarchical Groups","Automatic Search","Subspace Clustering","Subspace Representation","Tanimoto Similarity","Parallel Coordinates","Automatic Step","Analysis Workflow","Dimensional Distribution","Clustering Algorithm","Feature Space","Curse Of Dimensionality"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4752-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4753-2","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2012.6400492","title":"Inter-active learning of ad-hoc classifiers for video visual analytics","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-4752-5","partnum":"12EX7700","rank":44,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Institute of Cognitive Science, University of Osnabrück","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37571601300","id":37571601300,"full_name":"Benjamin Höferlin","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Cognitive Science, University of Osnabrück"]}},{"affiliation":"Visualization Research Center (VISUS), University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085504694","id":37085504694,"full_name":"Rudolf Netzel","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visualization Research Center (VISUS), University of Stuttgart"]}},{"affiliation":"Visualization Research Center (VISUS), University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37680797500","id":37680797500,"full_name":"Markus Höferlin","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visualization Research Center (VISUS), University of Stuttgart"]}},{"affiliation":"Visualization Research Center (VISUS), University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268045000","id":37268045000,"full_name":"Daniel Weiskopf","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visualization Research Center (VISUS), University of Stuttgart"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Cognitive Science, University of Osnabrück","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266102100","id":37266102100,"full_name":"Gunther Heidemann","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Cognitive Science, University of Osnabrück"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Learning of classifiers to be used as filters within the analytical reasoning process leads to new and aggravates existing challenges. Such classifiers are typically trained ad-hoc, with tight time constraints that affect the amount and the quality of annotation data and, thus, also the users' trust in the classifier trained. We approach the challenges of ad-hoc training by inter-active learning, which extends active learning by integrating human experts' background knowledge to greater extent. In contrast to active learning, not only does inter-active learning include the users' expertise by posing queries of data instances for labeling, but it also supports the users in comprehending the classifier model by visualization. Besides the annotation of manually or automatically selected data instances, users are empowered to directly adjust complex classifier models. Therefore, our model visualization facilitates the detection and correction of inconsistencies between the classifier model trained by examples and the user's mental model of the class definition. Visual feedback of the training process helps the users assess the performance of the classifier and, thus, build up trust in the filter created. We demonstrate the capabilities of inter-active learning in the domain of video visual analytics and compare its performance with the results of random sampling and uncertainty sampling of training sets.","article_number":"6400492","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400492","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400492/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400492/","publication_title":"2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Seattle, WA, USA","conference_dates":"14-19 Oct. 2012","publication_number":6381601,"is_number":6400483,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"14-19 Oct. 2012","start_page":"23","end_page":"32","citing_paper_count":54,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":1072,"insert_date":"20130103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Training","Data models","Visual analytics","Humans","Data visualization","Labeling","Analytical models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["H.3.3 [Information Systems]: Information Storage and Retrieval — Information Search and Retrieval","I.2.6 [Computing Methodologies]: Artificial Intelligence — Learning"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Interactive Learning","Training Set","Classification Model","Random Sampling","Active Learning","Annotation Data","Classifier Training","Background Knowledge","Human Experts","Data Instances","Instantaneous Data","Random Uncertainty","Machine Learning","False Positive Rate","Automatic Method","Video Frames","Stopping Criterion","Stopping Criteria","Labeled Data","Training Examples","Decision Boundary","Strong Classifier","Usage Scenarios","Training Cycle","Train Classification Models","Instance Selection","Uncertain Data","Multiple Examples","Classification Decision","Text Classification","Text Categorization","Document Classification","Binary Decision"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4752-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4753-2","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2012.6400487","title":"Just-in-time annotation of clusters, outliers, and trends in point-based data visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-4752-5","partnum":"12EX7700","rank":45,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"IBM Center for Advanced Visualization, IBM Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37269701600","id":37269701600,"full_name":"Eser Kandogan","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IBM Center for Advanced Visualization, IBM Research"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"We introduce the concept of just-in-time descriptive analytics as a novel application of computational and statistical techniques performed at interaction-time to help users easily understand the structure of data as seen in visualizations. Fundamental to just-intime descriptive analytics is (a) identifying visual features, such as clusters, outliers, and trends, user might observe in visualizations automatically, (b) determining the semantics of such features by performing statistical analysis as the user is interacting, and (c) enriching visualizations with annotations that not only describe semantics of visual features but also facilitate interaction to support high-level understanding of data. In this paper, we demonstrate just-in-time descriptive analytics applied to a point-based multi-dimensional visualization technique to identify and describe clusters, outliers, and trends.

Our examination of the use of large, high-resolution displays from an embodied perspective has lead directly to the development of a new sensemaking environment called Analyst's Workspace (AW). AW leverages the embodied resources made more accessible through the physical nature of the display to create a spatial workspace. By combining spatial layout of documents and other artifacts with an entity-centric, explorative investigative approach, AW aims to allow the analyst to externalize elements of the sensemaking process as a part of the investigation, integrated into the visual representations of the data itself. In this paper, we describe the various capabilities of AW and discuss the key principles and concepts underlying its design, emphasizing unique design principles for designing visual analytic tools for large, high-resolution displays.","article_number":"6400559","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400559","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400559/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400559/","publication_title":"2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Seattle, WA, USA","conference_dates":"14-19 Oct. 2012","publication_number":6381601,"is_number":6400483,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"14-19 Oct. 2012","start_page":"123","end_page":"131","citing_paper_count":43,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":546,"insert_date":"20130103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Cognition","Visualization","Humans","Navigation","Organizations","Monitoring","Keyboards"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Embodiment","distributed cognition","large","highresolution display","sensemaking","space"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Workspace","High-resolution Display","Visual Analysis","Knowledge Of Distribution","Distributed Cognition","Sense-making Process","Narrative","Search Terms","Use Of Tools","Search Results","End Of Process","Physical Body","Physical Objects","Physical Form","Physical Entities","Notebook","Spatial Organization","Space Use","Spatial Ability","Foraging Activity","Named Entity Recognition","Entity Extraction","Use Of Representations","Manipulation Of Representations","Intelligence Analysis","Primary Technique","Use Of Links","Spatial Metaphors","Physical Artefacts","Physical Artifacts","Display Size"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4752-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4753-2","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2012.6400491","title":"A correlative analysis process in a visual analytics environment","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-4752-5","partnum":"12EX7700","rank":47,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Purdue University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37397435000","id":37397435000,"full_name":"Abish Malik","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396008400","id":37396008400,"full_name":"Ross Maciejewski","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Sejong University, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295438200","id":37295438200,"full_name":"Niklas Elmqvist","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sejong University, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37557344300","id":37557344300,"full_name":"Yun Jang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282598900","id":37282598900,"full_name":"David S.

This has directly contributed to increased data complexity and dimensionality, motivating research of exploration techniques for multidimensional data. Consequently, a recent influx of work dedicated to techniques and tools that aid in understanding multidimensional datasets can be observed in many research fields, including biology, engineering, physics and scientific computing. While the effectiveness of existing techniques to analyze the structure and relationships of multidimensional data varies greatly, few techniques provide flexible mechanisms to simultaneously visualize and actively explore high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we present an inverse linear affine multidimensional projection, coined iLAMP, that enables a novel interactive exploration technique for multidimensional data. iLAMP operates in reverse to traditional projection methods by mapping low-dimensional information into a high-dimensional space. This allows users to extrapolate instances of a multidimensional dataset while exploring a projection of the data to the planar domain. We present experimental results that validate iLAMP, measuring the quality and coherence of the extrapolated data; as well as demonstrate the utility of iLAMP to hypothesize the unexplored regions of a high-dimensional space.","article_number":"6400489","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400489","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400489/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400489/","publication_title":"2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Seattle, WA, USA","conference_dates":"14-19 Oct. 2012","publication_number":6381601,"is_number":6400483,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"14-19 Oct. 2012","start_page":"53","end_page":"62","citing_paper_count":25,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":598,"insert_date":"20130103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Vectors","Space exploration","Optimization","Measurement","Robustness"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Multidimensional Projection","Computer Science","Dimensional Data","Regions Of Space","Multidimensional Data","Multidimensional Analysis","Linear Projection","Interactive Exploration","Instances In The Dataset","Optimization Problem","Dimensionality Reduction","Parameter Space","Regional Data","Automatic Method","Control Points","Singular Value Decomposition","Space Exploration","Space Missions","Affine Transformation","Original Space","Pair Of Points","Visualization Techniques","Visual Space","Parallel Coordinates","Visual Exploration","Hypersphere","Unit Hypersphere","Set Of Data Points","Points In The Dataset","Multidimensional Techniques","Computational Aspects","Projective Space","Affine Function","Affine Map","Local Minima"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4752-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4753-2","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2012.6400490","title":"Visual pattern discovery using random projections","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-4752-5","partnum":"12EX7700","rank":50,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Chicago","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37548165700","id":37548165700,"full_name":"Anushka Anand","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Chicago"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Chicago","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37560536200","id":37560536200,"full_name":"Leland Wilkinson","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Chicago"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Chicago","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606167900","id":37606167900,"full_name":"Tuan Nhon Dang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Chicago"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"An essential element of exploratory data analysis is the use of revealing low-dimensional projections of high-dimensional data.

We describe Deshredder, a visual analytic approach that scales well and effectively incorporates user input to direct the reconstruction process. Deshredder represents shredded pieces as time series and uses nearest neighbor matching techniques that enable matching both the contours of shredded pieces as well as the content of shreds themselves. More importantly, Deshred-der's interface support visual analytics through user interaction with similarity matrices as well as higher level assembly through more complex stitching functions.

In disaster scenarios like major accidents, however, the increased amount of detected incidents may lead to situations where human operators lose a sense of the overall meaning of that data, a problem commonly known as a lack of situation awareness. The primary contribution of this paper is a design study of AlVis, a system designed to increase situation awareness in the surveillance of road tunnels. The design of AlVis is based on a simplified tunnel model which enables an overview of the spatiotemporal development of scenarios in real-time. The visualization explicitly represents the present state, the history, and predictions of potential future developments. Concepts for situation-sensitive prioritization of information ensure scalability from normal operation to major disaster scenarios. The visualization enables an intuitive access to live and historic video for any point in time and space. We illustrate AlVis by means of a scenario and report qualitative feedback by tunnel experts and operators. This feedback suggests that AlVis is suitable to save time in recognizing dangerous situations and helps to maintain an overview in complex disaster scenarios.","article_number":"6400556","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400556","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400556/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400556/","publication_title":"2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Seattle, WA, USA","conference_dates":"14-19 Oct. 2012","publication_number":6381601,"is_number":6400483,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"14-19 Oct. 2012","start_page":"153","end_page":"162","citing_paper_count":16,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":698,"insert_date":"20130103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Surveillance","Cameras","Visualization","Roads","Context","Vehicles","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["K.6.1 [Management of Computing and Information Systems]","Project and People Management—Life Cycle"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Situational Awareness","Road Tunnel","Time And Space","Spacetime","Points In Space","Normal Operation","Live Video","Major Accidents","Disaster Scenarios","Time Interval","Stressful Situations","Spatial Dimensions","Spatial Attributes","Surveillance Data","Regions Of Space","Maximum Density","Traffic Congestion","Traffic Density","Traffic Jams","Incidence Of Type","Firefighters","Visual Approach","Spatiotemporal Data","Video Player","Priority Level","Video Material","Horizontal Spacing","Horizontal Forms","Multiple Cameras","Connecting Lines","Line Joining","Exit Tunnel","Single Click","Prioritization Strategies","Prioritization Scheme","Specific Time Points","Particular Point In Time"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4752-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4753-2","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2012.6400552","title":"Watch this: A taxonomy for dynamic data visualization","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-4752-5","partnum":"12EX7700","rank":53,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Indiana University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546825800","id":37546825800,"full_name":"Joseph A.

To interpret a static visualization, a person must identify the correspondences between the visual representation and the underlying data. These correspondences become moving targets when a visualization is dynamic. Dynamics may be introduced in a visualization at any point in the analysis and visualization process. For example, the data itself may be streaming, shifting subsets may be selected, visual representations may be animated, and interaction may modify presentation. In this paper, we focus on the impact of dynamic data. We present a taxonomy and conceptual framework for understanding how data changes influence the interpretability of visual representations. Visualization techniques are organized into categories at various levels of abstraction. The salient characteristics of each category and task suitability are discussed through examples from the scientific literature and popular practices. Examining the implications of dynamically updating visualizations warrants attention because it directly impacts the interpretability (and thus utility) of visualizations. The taxonomy presented provides a reference point for further exploration of dynamic data visualization techniques.","article_number":"6400552","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400552","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400552/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400552/","publication_title":"2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Seattle, WA, USA","conference_dates":"14-19 Oct. 2012","publication_number":6381601,"is_number":6400483,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"14-19 Oct. 2012","start_page":"193","end_page":"202","citing_paper_count":13,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1613,"insert_date":"20130103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Retina","Visualization","Taxonomy","Encoding","Image color analysis","Context"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Dynamic Data","Interpretation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Kinetic Data","Dynamic Data","Dynamic Visualization","Dynamic Data Visualization","Visual Processing","Visual Representation","Visualization Techniques","Time Step","Spatial Variation","Supplemental Data","Spatial Dimensions","Spatial Attributes","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Visible Changes","Data Streams","Reference System","Amount Of Elements","Quantity Of Elements","Visual Elements","Line Balancing","Flow Lines","Categorical Scale","Representative Element","Identity Preservation","Dynamic Representation","Preservation Techniques","Point Registration","Point Of Enrolment","Comparison Task","Spatial Encoding","Graph Layout","Graph Drawing","High-level Categories","Higher-level Categories","Stock Market","Cognitive Load","Cognitive Demands","Mental Workload","Mental Effort"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4752-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4753-2","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2012.6400484","title":"Relative N-gram signatures: Document visualization at the level of character N-grams","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-4752-5","partnum":"12EX7700","rank":54,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Faculty of Computer Science, Dalhousie University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086728639","id":37086728639,"full_name":"Magdalena Jankowska","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science, Dalhousie University"]}},{"affiliation":"Faculty of Computer Science, Dalhousie University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37330036800","id":37330036800,"full_name":"Vlado Kešelj","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science, Dalhousie University"]}},{"affiliation":"Faculty of Computer Science, Dalhousie University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37329406700","id":37329406700,"full_name":"Evangelos Milios","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science, Dalhousie University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"The Common N-Gram (CNG) classifier is a text classification algorithm based on the comparison of frequencies of character n-grams (strings of characters of length n) that are the most common in the considered documents and classes of documents.

In many visualization systems, successive interactions trigger independent queries and caching of results. Consequently, computationally expensive queries like multidimensional clustering cannot keep up with rapid sequences of interactions, precluding visual benefits such as motion parallax. In this paper, we describe a heuristic prefetching technique to improve the interactive response time of KMeans clustering in dynamic query visualizations of multidimensional data. We address the tradeoff between high interaction and intense query computation by observing how related interactions on overlapping data subsets produce similar clustering results, and characterizing these similarities within a parameter space of interaction. We focus on the two-dimensional parameter space defined by the minimum and maximum values of a time range manipulated by dragging and stretching a one-dimensional filtering lens over a plot of time series data. Using calculation of nearest neighbors of interaction points in parameter space, we reuse partial query results from prior interaction sequences to calculate both an immediate best-effort clustering result and to schedule calculation of an exact result. The method adapts to user interaction patterns in the parameter space by reprioritizing the interaction neighbors of visited points in the parameter space. A performance study on Mesonet meteorological data demonstrates that the method is a significant improvement over the baseline scheme in which interaction triggers on-demand, exact-range clustering with LRU caching. We also present initial evidence that approximate, temporary clustering results are sufficiently accurate (compared to exact results) to convey useful cluster structure during rapid and protracted interaction.","article_number":"6400493","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400493","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400493/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400493/","publication_title":"2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Seattle, WA, USA","conference_dates":"14-19 Oct. 2012","publication_number":6381601,"is_number":6400483,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"14-19 Oct. 2012","start_page":"13","end_page":"22","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":479,"insert_date":"20130103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Prefetching","Clustering algorithms","Lenses","Data visualization","Visualization","Algorithm design and analysis","Time series analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["D.2.2 [Software Engineering]: Design Tools and Techniques — [User Interfaces]","H.2.3 [Information Systems]: Database Management — [Languages]","H.5.2 [Information Systems]: Information Interfaces and Presentation — [User Interfaces]"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Adaptive Algorithm","Version Of Algorithm","Interactive Exploration","Space-filling Algorithm","K-means","K-means Clustering","Time Range","Parameter Space","Interaction Patterns","Points In Space","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Clustering Results","Visualization Tool","Exact Results","Exact Outcome","Sequential Interactions","Query Results","Remote Memory","Cache Memory","Types Of Interactions","Visual Analysis","Interactive System","Intersection Over Union","Jaccard Similarity","Jaccard Distance","Jaccard Index","Regions Of Space","Cache Hit","Cache Hit Ratio","Cache Hit Rate","High-dimensional Parameter Space","Priority Queue","Mesomorphic","Visual Exploration","Cache Misses","Triangular Region","Time-varying Data","Interactive Visualization","Visual Analytics Tool"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4752-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4753-2","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2012.6400555","title":"Smart super views — A knowledge-assisted interface for medical visualization","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-4752-5","partnum":"12EX7700","rank":56,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Vienna University of Technoloqy, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233231400","id":38233231400,"full_name":"Gabriel Mistelbauer","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Vienna University of Technoloqy, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Austrian Academy of Sciences","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37580464100","id":37580464100,"full_name":"Arnold Köchl","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Austrian Academy of Sciences"]}},{"affiliation":"Medical University of Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233231200","id":38233231200,"full_name":"Rudiger Schernthaner","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Medical University of Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Kaiser-Franz-Josef Hospital Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077614100","id":37077614100,"full_name":"Ivan Baclija","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Kaiser-Franz-Josef Hospital Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Kaiser-Franz-Josef Hospital Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282581900","id":37282581900,"full_name":"Rüdiger Schernthaner","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Kaiser-Franz-Josef Hospital Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Vienna University of Technoloqy, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37265895700","id":37265895700,"full_name":"Stefan Bruckner","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Vienna University of Technoloqy, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Austrian Academy of Sciences","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37281909700","id":37281909700,"full_name":"Milos Sramek","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Austrian Academy of Sciences"]}},{"affiliation":"Vienna University of Technoloqy, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282552200","id":37282552200,"full_name":"Meister Eduard Gröller","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Vienna University of Technoloqy, Austria"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Due to the ever growing volume of acquired data and information, users have to be constantly aware of the methods for their exploration and for interaction.

Analyzing such network with social attributes requires making sense of not only its structural features, but also the relationship between social features in attributes and network structures. Existing social network analysis tools are usually weak in supporting complex analytical tasks involving both structural and social features, and often overlook users' needs for sensemaking tools that help to gather, synthesize, and organize information of these features. To address these challenges, we propose a sensemaking framework of social-network visual analytics in this paper. This framework considers both bottom-up processes, which are about constructing new understandings based on collected information, and top-down processes, which concern using prior knowledge to guide information collection, in analyzing social networks from both social and structural perspectives. The framework also emphasizes the externalization of sensemaking processes through interactive visualization. Guided by the framework, we develop a system, SocialNetSense, to support the sensemaking in visual analytics of social networks with social attributes. The example of using our system to analyze a scholar collaboration network shows that our approach can help users gain insight into social networks both structurally and socially, and enhance their process awareness in visual analytics.","article_number":"6400558","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400558","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400558/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400558/","publication_title":"2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Seattle, WA, USA","conference_dates":"14-19 Oct. 2012","publication_number":6381601,"is_number":6400483,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"14-19 Oct. 2012","start_page":"133","end_page":"142","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":710,"insert_date":"20130103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Social network services","Data visualization","Visual analytics","Educational institutions","Collaboration","History"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Social network","visualization","sensemaking","visual analytics","SocialNetSense"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Network Characteristics","Network Features","Social Characteristics","Social Quality","Social Features","Interactive Visualization","Social Networks","Social Dimensions","Attribution Theory","Social Attributes","Causal Attributions","Visual Analysis","Social Perspective","Collaborative Network","Top-down Processes","Social Network Analysis","Bottom-up Processes","Structural Perspective","Sense-making Process","Visual System","Visual Representation","Management Process","Types Of Networks","Multivariate Data","Multivariate Statistics","Top-down Approach","Top-down Model","Visual Network","Network Diagram","Network Patterns","School Of Public Health","Network View","Visual Exploration","Tree View","Branch Nodes","Aggregation Network","Hybrid Feature","Hybrid Character","Collaboration Patterns","Tree Structure"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4752-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4753-2","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2012.6400496","title":"Committee","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-4752-5","partnum":"12EX7700","rank":58,"authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Provides a listing of current committee members.","article_number":"6400496","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400496","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400496/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400496/","publication_title":"2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Seattle, WA, USA","conference_dates":"14-19 Oct. 2012","publication_number":6381601,"is_number":6400483,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"14-19 Oct. 2012","start_page":"1","end_page":"1","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":87,"insert_date":"20130103","index_terms":{},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4752-5","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4753-2","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2012.6400499","title":"Preface: Message from the General and Paper Chairs","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-4752-5","partnum":"12EX7700","rank":59,"authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"The IEEE Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST) Conference continues to develop and grow. Each year brings new researchers to the field and produces important advances in the theory and practice of visual analytics. VAST is now in its seventh year, and it is the third year as an IEEE Conference. The presented work demonstrates significant growth and maturation of the visual analytics community. We received 104 submissions and were able to accept 30 papers into the program. The conference program reflects the breadth of research in the visual analytics community. Paper sessions cover such areas as foundations of the analysis process; tree, network and social network analysis; support for sensemaking and collaborative analysis; visual computational analysis of multivariate data; space and time; and many applications of visual analytics capabilities such as in the biomedical field, risk management, text and document analysis. To select this year's program, an international program committee of 35 experts carefully considered and reviewed the papers through a two-cycle review process instituted this year. Each paper was assigned to a primary and a secondary reviewer from this committee. The primary and secondary reviewers assigned one more tertiary reviewer to each paper so that at least four reviews were provided for all papers. Based on these reviews, the paper chairs selected the papers conditionally first. The primary reviewer had to evaluate the revised papers carefully in the second review cycle. Finally, the paper chairs accepted 30 papers and organized the program sessions.

The challenge scenario is centered around the computer network of the fictitious Bank of Money (BoM). BoM operates 888,977 computers which are geographically distributed on a fictitious landmass. The provided data has a hierarchical structure grouping machines in business units, facilities, machine classes and machine types. For each machine, up to 192 status logs in a two day time period were provided. These logs report on three status attributes: policy, activity and number of connections. The main task of Mini-Challenge 1 was to highlight up to five anomalies in the massive data set. We address this challenge by presenting HIVEBEAT, a highly interactive visualization environment for broad-scale exploratory analysis and tracing.
