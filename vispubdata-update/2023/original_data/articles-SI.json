Yet support for uncertainty visualization in the grammar graphics—beyond simple variations of error bars, uncertainty bands, and density plots—remains rudimentary. Research in uncertainty visualization has developed a rich variety of improved uncertainty visualizations, most of which are difficult to create in existing grammar of graphics implementations. ggdist, an extension to the popular ggplot2 grammar of graphics toolkit, is an attempt to rectify this situation. ggdist unifies a variety of uncertainty visualization types through the lens of distributional visualization, allowing functions of distributions to be mapped to directly to visual channels (aesthetics), making it straightforward to express a variety of (sometimes weird!) uncertainty visualization types. This distributional lens also offers a way to unify Bayesian and frequentist uncertainty visualization by formalizing the latter with the help of confidence distributions. In this paper, I offer a description of this uncertainty visualization paradigm and lessons learned from its development and adoption: ggdist has existed in some form for about six years (originally as part of the tidybayes R package for post-processing Bayesian models), and it has evolved substantially over that time, with several rewrites and API re-organizations as it changed in response to user feedback and expanded to cover increasing varieties of uncertainty visualization types. Ultimately, given the huge expressive power of the grammar of graphics and the popularity of tools built on it, I hope a catalog of my experience with ggdist will provide a catalyst for further improvements to formalizations and implementations of uncertainty visualization in grammar of graphics ecosystems.

Visualizing data in spatial proximity to their physical referents affords new design opportunities and considerations not present in traditional visualization, which researchers are now beginning to explore. However, the AR research community has an extensive history of designing graphics that are displayed in highly physical contexts. In this work, we leverage the richness of AR research and apply it to situated visualization. We derive design patterns which summarize common approaches of visualizing data in situ. The design patterns are based on a survey of 293 papers published in the AR and visualization communities, as well as our own expertise. We discuss design dimensions that help to describe both our patterns and previous work in the literature. This discussion is accompanied by several guidelines which explain how to apply the patterns given the constraints imposed by the real world. We conclude by discussing future research directions that will help establish a complete understanding of the design of situated visualization, including the role of interactivity, tasks, and workflows.","article_number":"10297565","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10297565","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10297565/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10297565/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"1324","end_page":"1335","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":736,"insert_date":"20231026","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Surveys","Semantics","Augmented reality","Object recognition","Guidelines"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Augmented reality","immersive analytics","situated visualization","design patterns","design space"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Design Patterns","Situated Visualization","Interactive","Design Considerations","Design Properties","Design Attributes","Design Dimensions","Cardinality","Set Size","Visual Information","Physical Body","Physical Objects","Physical Form","Physical Entities","Patterns Of Use","Regions Of Space","Design Space","Visual Form","Coordinate Frame","Multiple Reference","Head-mounted Display","Design Constraints","Visual Design","Virtual Objects","Single View","Mixed Reality","Physicalism","Location-aware","Building Information Modelling","Type Of Visualization","Tactile Interaction","Important Constraints","Visual Encoding","Visual Representation","Virtually","Virtual Environment","Virtual Reality","Interaction Techniques"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327378","title":"Challenges and Opportunities in Data Visualization Education: A Call to Action","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":3,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085687578","id":37085687578,"full_name":"Benjamin Bach","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088222488","id":37088222488,"full_name":"Mandy Keck","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Carleton University, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38466219300","id":38466219300,"full_name":"Fateme Rajabiyazdi","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Carleton University, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"Simon Fraser University, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088633299","id":37088633299,"full_name":"Tatiana Losev","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Simon Fraser University, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"OCAD University, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089652775","id":37089652775,"full_name":"Isabel Meirelles","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["OCAD University, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"City University London, United Kingdom","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37605079900","id":37605079900,"full_name":"Jason Dykes","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["City University London, United Kingdom"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Nottingham, United Kingdom","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267247900","id":37267247900,"full_name":"Robert S.

As visualization evolves and spreads through our professional and personal lives, we need to understand how to support and empower a broad and diverse community of learners in visualization. Data Visualization is a diverse and dynamic discipline that combines knowledge from different fields, is tailored to suit diverse audiences and contexts, and frequently incorporates tacit knowledge. This complex nature leads to a series of interrelated challenges for data visualization education. Driven by a lack of consolidated knowledge, overview, and orientation for visualization education, the 21 authors of this paper—educators and researchers in data visualization—identify and describe 19 challenges informed by our collective practical experience. We organize these challenges around seven themes People, Goals & Assessment, Environment, Motivation, Methods, Materials, and Change. Across these themes, we formulate 43 research questions to address these challenges. As part of our call to action, we then conclude with 5 cross-cutting opportunities and respective action items: embrace DIVERSITY+INCLUSION, build COMMUNITIES, conduct RESEARCH, act AGILE, and relish RESPONSIBILITY. We aim to inspire researchers, educators and learners to drive visualization education forward and discuss why, how, who and where we educate, as we learn to use visualization to address challenges

(AR) assistants has captured the human imagination for decades, becoming a staple of modern science fiction. To pursue this goal, it is necessary to develop artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods that simultaneously perceive the 3D environment, reason about physical tasks, and model the performer, all in real-time. Within this framework, a wide variety of sensors are needed to generate data across different modalities, such as audio, video, depth, speech, and time-of-flight. The required sensors are typically part of the AR headset, providing performer sensing and interaction through visual, audio, and haptic feedback. AI assistants not only record the performer as they perform activities, but also require machine learning (ML) models to understand and assist the performer as they interact with the physical world. Therefore, developing such assistants is a challenging task. We propose ARGUS, a visual analytics system to support the development of intelligent AR assistants. Our system was designed as part of a multi-year-long collaboration between visualization researchers and ML and AR experts. This co-design process has led to advances in the visualization of ML in AR. Our system allows for online visualization of object, action, and step detection as well as offline analysis of previously recorded AR sessions. It visualizes not only the multimodal sensor data streams but also the output of the ML models. This allows developers to gain insights into the performer activities as well as the ML models, helping them troubleshoot, improve, and fine-tune the components of the AR assistant.","article_number":"10305427","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10305427","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10305427/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10305427/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"1313","end_page":"1323","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":467,"insert_date":"20231102","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Task analysis","Data visualization","Data models","Headphones","Real-time systems","Streams","Debugging"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data Models","Image and Video Data","Temporal Data","Application Motivated Visualization","AR/VR/Immersive"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Task Guidance","Machine Learning Models","Visual System","Object Detection","Visual Feedback","Video Feedback","Data Streams","Object Recognition","Point Cloud","Bounding Box","Visualization Tool","Action Recognition","Debugging","Confidence Value","3D Point Cloud","Gaze Direction","Assistance Systems","Head-mounted Display","Online Modules","Entire Session","Point Cloud Data","Tortillas","Robot Operating System","Hand Tracking","Finger Tracking","Visual Interface","Augmented Reality System","Average Confidence","Exploratory Data","Object Detection Model","Field Of View"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326516","title":"EVM: Incorporating Model Checking into Exploratory Visual Analysis","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":5,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Chicago, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543362","id":37086543362,"full_name":"Alex Kale","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Chicago, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088750906","id":37088750906,"full_name":"Ziyang Guo","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/421842071198564","id":421842071198564,"full_name":"Xiao Li Qiao","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Washington, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550791300","id":37550791300,"full_name":"Jeffrey Heer","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Washington, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38016234500","id":38016234500,"full_name":"Jessica Hullman","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Visual analytics (VA) tools support data exploration by helping analysts quickly and iteratively generate views of data which reveal interesting patterns. However, these tools seldom enable explicit checks of the resulting interpretations of data—e.g., whether patterns can be accounted for by a model that implies a particular structure in the relationships between variables. We present EVM, a data exploration tool that enables users to express and check provisional interpretations of data in the form of statistical models. EVM integrates support for visualization-based model checks by rendering distributions of model predictions alongside user-generated views of data. In a user study with data scientists practicing in the private and public sector, we evaluate how model checks influence analysts' thinking during data exploration. Our analysis characterizes how participants use model checks to scrutinize expectations about data generating process and surfaces further opportunities to scaffold model exploration in VA tools.","article_number":"10291034","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10291034","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10291034/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10291034/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"208","end_page":"218","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":199,"insert_date":"20231023","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data models","Analytical models","Visualization","Data visualization","Predictive models","Model checking","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","model checks","exploratory analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Exploratory Analysis","Exploratory Data Analysis","Visual Analysis","Model Checking","Exploratory Visual Analysis","Prediction Model","Statistical Models","Interpretation Of Data","User Study","Exploratory Data","Predictive Distribution","View Data","Visual Analytics Tool","Semi-structured Interviews","Hypothesis Testing","Model Specification","Patterns In Data","Dataset Size","Series Of Models","Serial Model","Wildfire","Forest Fires","Bushfire","Visual Exploration","Hold-out Set","Distribution Of Continuous Variables","Lognormal Model","Family Of Distributions","Tail Of Distribution","Visual Model","Variance In The Dataset","Split-plot","Split-plot Design","Workflow"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327197","title":"Data Player: Automatic Generation of Data Videos with Narration-Animation Interplay","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":6,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641322","id":37089641322,"full_name":"Leixian Shen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Cornell University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089992583","id":37089992583,"full_name":"Yizhi Zhang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Cornell University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073639100","id":37073639100,"full_name":"Haidong Zhang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), China"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086545328","id":37086545328,"full_name":"Yun Wang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Data visualizations and narratives are often integrated to convey data stories effectively. Among various data storytelling formats, data videos have been garnering increasing attention. These videos provide an intuitive interpretation of data charts while vividly articulating the underlying data insights. However, the production of data videos demands a diverse set of professional skills and considerable manual labor, including understanding narratives, linking visual elements with narration segments, designing and crafting animations, recording audio narrations, and synchronizing audio with visual animations. To simplify this process, our paper introduces a novel method, referred to as Data Player, capable of automatically generating dynamic data videos with narration-animation interplay. This approach lowers the technical barriers associated with creating data videos rich in narration. To enable narration-animation interplay, Data Player constructs references between visualizations and text input. Specifically, it first extracts data into tables from the visualizations. Subsequently, it utilizes large language models to form semantic connections between text and visuals. Finally, Data Player encodes animation design knowledge as computational low-level constraints, allowing for the recommendation of suitable animation presets that align with the audio narration produced by text-to-speech technologies. We assessed Data Player's efficacy through an example gallery, a user study, and expert interviews. The evaluation results demonstrated that Data Player can generate high-quality data videos that are comparable to human-composed ones.","article_number":"10308700","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10308700","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10308700/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10308700/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"109","end_page":"119","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":435,"insert_date":"20231103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Videos","Data visualization","Animation","Visualization","Interviews","Electronic mail","Data models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Narration-animation interplay","Data video","Human-AI collaboration"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Automatic Generation","Data Visualization","User Study","Visual Elements","Expert Interviews","Input Text","Design Knowledge","Design Cognition","Computational Constraints","Aftereffects","Neural Adaptation","Group Elements","Stock Price","Pie Chart","Tourism Sector","Content Creation","Design Constraints","Video Quality","Established Link","Visual Design","Tax Payments","Set Of Videos","Semantic Links","Visual Style","Chinese Tourists","High-level Design","Higher-level Design","Constraint Satisfaction Problem","Constraint Solver","Constraint Programming","Professional Tool","Visual Narrative","Professional Software"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327163","title":"AttentionViz: A Global View of Transformer Attention","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":7,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Harvard University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/444989430835765","id":444989430835765,"full_name":"Catherine Yeh","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089999307","id":37089999307,"full_name":"Yida Chen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086808853","id":37086808853,"full_name":"Aoyu Wu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/272250779939331","id":272250779939331,"full_name":"Cynthia Chen","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681355300","id":37681355300,"full_name":"Fernanda Viégas","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University, USA","Google, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089884670","id":37089884670,"full_name":"Martin Wattenberg","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University, USA","Google, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Transformer models are revolutionizing machine learning, but their inner workings remain mysterious.

To address these challenges, we present DiagnosisAssistant, a visual analytics system that leverages historical medical records as a proxy for multimodal modeling and visualization to enhance the learning experience of interns and novice physicians. The system employs elaborately designed visualizations to explore different modality data, offer diagnostic interpretive hints based on the constructed model, and enable comparative analyses of specific patients.

In the past few years, urban visual analytics tools have significantly helped tackle these challenges. When analyzing a feature of interest, an urban expert must transform, integrate, and visualize different thematic (e.g., sunlight access, demographic) and physical (e.g., buildings, street networks) data layers, oftentimes across multiple spatial and temporal scales. However, integrating and analyzing these layers require expertise in different fields, increasing development time and effort. This makes the entire visual data exploration and system implementation difficult for programmers and also sets a high entry barrier for urban experts outside of computer science. With this in mind, in this paper, we present the Urban Toolkit (UTK), a flexible and extensible visualization framework that enables the easy authoring of web-based visualizations through a new high-level grammar specifically built with common urban use cases in mind.

To address these challenges, we present Data Navigator: a system built on a dynamic graph structure, enabling developers to construct navigable lists, trees, graphs, and flows as well as spatial, diagrammatic, and geographic relations. Data Navigator supports a wide range of input modalities: screen reader, keyboard, speech, gesture detection, and even fabricated assistive devices. We present 3 case examples with Data Navigator, demonstrating we can provide accessible navigation structures on top of raster images, integrate with existing toolkits at scale, and rapidly develop novel prototypes.

Our findings reveal three major personas among KG practitioners – KG Builders, Analysts, and Consumers – each of whom have their own distinct expertise and needs. We discover that KG Builders would benefit from schema enforcers, while KG Analysts need customizable query builders that provide interim query results. For KG Consumers, we identify a lack of efficacy for node-link diagrams, and the need for tailored domain-specific visualizations to promote KG adoption and comprehension. Lastly, we find that implementing KGs effectively in practice requires both technical and social solutions that are not addressed with current tools, technologies, and collaborative workflows. From the analysis of our interviews, we distill several visualization research directions to improve KG usability, including knowledge cards that balance digestibility and discoverability, timeline views to track temporal changes, interfaces that support organic discovery, and semantic explanations for AI and machine learning predictions.","article_number":"10360419","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10360419","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10360419/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10360419/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"584","end_page":"594","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":490,"insert_date":"20231214","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Knowledge graphs","Data visualization","Interviews","Task analysis","Data models","Standards organizations","Semantics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Knowledge graphs","visualization techniques and methodologies","human factors","visual communication"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Vision Research","Visual Design","End-users","Forms Of Knowledge","Knowledge Information","Interview Participants","Visualization Tool","Current Design","Current Name","Visual Methods","System Database","Temporal Data","Relational Database","Related Queries","Industrial Settings","Data Warehouse","Visibility Graph","Wide Adoption","Rate Your","Query Language","Sanity Check","Visual Interface","ML Models","Graph Database","Visual Metaphors","Supplemental Material","Explainable Artificial Intelligence","Explainable AI","Explainable Machine Learning"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327363","title":"Socrates: Data Story Generation via Adaptive Machine-Guided Elicitation of User Feedback","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":14,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"New York University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089537712","id":37089537712,"full_name":"Guande Wu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Adobe Research, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547434","id":37086547434,"full_name":"Shunan Guo","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Adobe Research, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Adobe Research, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085728980","id":37085728980,"full_name":"Jane Hoffswell","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Adobe Research, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Adobe Research, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086544677","id":37086544677,"full_name":"Gromit Yeuk-Yin Chan","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Adobe Research, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Adobe Research, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085372098","id":37085372098,"full_name":"Ryan A.

We present a novel data story generation workflow that leverages adaptive machine-guided elicitation of user feedback to customize the story. Our approach employs an adaptive plug-in module for existing story generation systems, which incorporates user feedback through interactive questioning based on the conversation history and dataset. This adaptability refines the system's understanding of the user's intentions, ensuring the final narrative aligns with their goals. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through the implementation of an interactive prototype: Socrates. Through a quantitative user study with 18 participants that compares our method to a state-of-the-art data story generation algorithm, we show that Socrates produces more relevant stories with a larger overlap of insights compared to human-generated stories. We also demonstrate the usability of Socrates via interviews with three data analysts and highlight areas of future work.","article_number":"10308697","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10308697","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10308697/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10308697/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"131","end_page":"141","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":348,"insert_date":"20231103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Videos","Prototypes","Interviews","Optimization","Authoring systems"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Narrative visualization","visual storytelling","conversational agent"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["User Feedback","Data Stories","Story Generation","Data Visualization","User Study","Understanding Of Use","Understanding Of Users","Usage Intention","Insightful Findings","Discovery Of Insights","Audience","Years Of Experience","F1 Score","F-measure","Patterns In Data","Storytelling","Subjective Ratings","Factors Of Interest","Analysis Tasks","User Preferences","Unit Price","Pareto Front","Pareto Frontier","Narrative Structure","Story Structure","Narrative Patterns","Monte Carlo Tree Search","Conversational Agents","Number Of Facts","Story Content","Iterative Feedback","Data Journalism","Diary Data","Data-driven Journalism","User Goals","User Responses"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327371","title":"Differentiable Design Galleries: A Differentiable Approach to Explore the Design Space of Transfer Functions","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":15,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/853524548943826","id":853524548943826,"full_name":"Bo Pan","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085920346","id":37085920346,"full_name":"Jiaying Lu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089359052","id":37089359052,"full_name":"Haoxuan Li","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University of Finance&Economics, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37291847800","id":37291847800,"full_name":"Weifeng Chen","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhejiang University of Finance&Economics, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089747618","id":37089747618,"full_name":"Yiyao Wang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086420980","id":37086420980,"full_name":"Minfeng Zhu","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088886616","id":37088886616,"full_name":"Chenhao Yu","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37291847800","id":37291847800,"full_name":"Wei Chen","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","Laboratory of Art and Archaeology Image, Ministry of Education, Zhejiang University, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The transfer function is crucial for direct volume rendering (DVR) to create an informative visual representation of volumetric data.

Using our forecast model of the governor elections in 33 states, we created a website and deployed four uncertainty visualizations for the election forecasts: single quantile dotplot (1-Dotplot), dual quantile dotplots (2-Dotplot), dual histogram intervals (2-Interval), and Plinko quantile dotplot (Plinko), an animated design with a physical and probabilistic analogy. Our online experiment ran from Oct. 18, 2022, to Nov. 23, 2022, involving 1,327 participants from 15 states. We use Bayesian multilevel modeling and post-stratification to produce demographically-representative estimates of people's emotions, trust in forecasts, and political participation intention. We find that election forecast visualizations can heighten emotions, increase trust, and slightly affect people's intentions to participate in elections. 2-Interval shows the strongest effects across all measures; 1-Dotplot increases trust the most after elections. Both visualizations create emotional and trust gaps between different partisan identities, especially when a Republican candidate is predicted to win. Our qualitative analysis uncovers the complex political and social contexts of election forecast visualizations, showcasing that visualizations may provoke polarization. This intriguing interplay between visualization types, partisanship, and trust exemplifies the fundamental challenge of disentangling visualization from its context, underscoring a need for deeper investigation into the real-world impacts of visualizations.

Recent studies have shown that the DL success is often attributed to effective data representations, fostering the fields of feature engineering and representation learning. However, automated approaches for feature learning are typically limited with respect to incorporating prior knowledge, identifying interactions among variables, and choosing evaluation metrics to ensure that the models are reliable. To improve on these limitations, this paper contributes a novel visual analytics framework, namely TimeTuner, designed to help analysts understand how model behaviors are associated with localized correlations, stationarity, and granularity of time-series representations. The system mainly consists of the following two-stage technique: We first leverage counterfactual explanations to connect the relationships among time-series representations, multivariate features and model predictions.

However, for users who lack visual analysis expertise, interpreting and manipulating EVA can be challenging. Thus, providing guidance on EVA is necessary and two relevant questions need to be answered. First, how to recommend interesting insights to provide a first glance at data and help develop an exploration goal. Second, how to provide step-by-step EVA suggestions to help identify which parts of the data to explore. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based system, Visail, which generates EVA sequences to guide the exploration of time series data. As a user uploads a time series dataset, Visail can generate step-by-step EVA suggestions, while each step is visualized as an annotated chart combined with textual descriptions. The RL-based algorithm uses exploratory data analysis knowledge to construct the state and action spaces for the agent to imitate human analysis behaviors in data exploration tasks. In this way, the agent learns the strategy of generating coherent EVA sequences through a well-designed network. To evaluate the effectiveness of our system, we conducted an ablation study, a user study, and two case studies. The results of our evaluation suggested that Visail can provide effective guidance on supporting EVA on time series data.","article_number":"10297595","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10297595","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10297595/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10297595/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"1172","end_page":"1182","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":448,"insert_date":"20231026","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Time series analysis","Data visualization","Task analysis","Data mining","Data analysis","Visual analytics","Reinforcement learning"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Time Series Data","Exploratory Visual Analysis","Reinforcement Learning"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Time Series","Exploratory Analysis","Exploratory Data Analysis","Time Series Data","Visual Analysis","Exploratory Visual Analysis","Human Behavior","State Space","User Study","Exploratory Data","Textual Descriptions","Time Series Dataset","Visual Analysis Of Data","Metadata","Time Series Analysis","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Notebook","Tidal Volume","Tidal Ventilation","Reward Function","Markov Decision Process","Markov Decision Process Model","Reinforcement Learning Agent","Reinforcement Learning Algorithm","Proximal Policy Optimization","Virtual Machines","Generation Module","Propagation Module","Feature Engineering","Co-occurrence Relationships","Actual Probability","Current Insights"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326527","title":"Too Many Cooks: Exploring How Graphical Perception Studies Influence Visualization Recommendations in Draco","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":19,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Maryland, College Park, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089205296","id":37089205296,"full_name":"Zehua Zeng","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Washington, Seattle, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089973041","id":37089973041,"full_name":"Junran Yang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Washington, Seattle, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Carnegie Mellon University, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085711170","id":37085711170,"full_name":"Dominik Moritz","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Washington, Seattle, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550791300","id":37550791300,"full_name":"Jeffrey Heer","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Washington, Seattle, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Washington, Seattle, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086366223","id":37086366223,"full_name":"Leilani Battle","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Washington, Seattle, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Findings from graphical perception can guide visualization recommendation algorithms in identifying effective visualization designs.

However, state-of-the-art SRNs do not adapt the allocation of available network parameters to the complex features found in scientific data, leading to a loss in reconstruction quality. We address this shortcoming with an adaptively placed multi-grid SRN (APMGSRN) and propose a domain decomposition training and inference technique for accelerated parallel training on multi-GPU systems. We also release an open-source neural volume rendering application that allows plug-and-play rendering with any PyTorch-based SRN. Our proposed APMGSRN architecture uses multiple spatially adaptive feature grids that learn where to be placed within the domain to dynamically allocate more neural network resources where error is high in the volume, improving state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy of SRNs for scientific data without requiring expensive octree refining, pruning, and traversal like previous adaptive models. In our domain decomposition approach for representing large-scale data, we train an set of APMGSRNs in parallel on separate bricks of the volume to reduce training time while avoiding overhead necessary for an out-of-core solution for volumes too large to fit in GPU memory. After training, the lightweight SRNs are used for realtime neural volume rendering in our open-source renderer, where arbitrary view angles and transfer functions can be explored.

To address these challenges, we propose FSLens, an interactive visual analytics system that enables in-depth evaluation and rational optimization of fire station layout. Our approach integrates fire records and correlation features to reveal fire occurrence patterns and influencing factors using spatiotemporal sequence forecasting. We design an interactive visualization method to explore areas within the city that are potentially under-resourced for fire service based on the fire distribution and existing fire station layout. Moreover, we develop a collaborative human-computer multi-criteria decision model that generates multiple candidate solutions for optimizing firefighting resources within these areas. We simulate and compare the impact of different solutions on the original layout through well-designed visualizations, providing decision-makers with the most satisfactory solution.

In this paper, we report on the results of an interview study with 17 participants working in a range of roles at a long-established, traditional manufacturing company as they adopted Microsoft Power BI. The results highlight a number of socio-technical challenges the employees faced, including difficulties in training, using and creating dashboards, and transitioning to a modern digital company.

While data programming shows promise in generating labeled data at scale with user-defined labeling functions, the high dimensional and complex temporal information in videos poses additional challenges for effectively composing and evaluating labeling functions. In this paper, we propose VideoPro, a visual analytics approach to support flexible and scalable video data programming for model steering with reduced human effort. We first extract human-understandable events from videos using computer vision techniques and treat them as atomic components of labeling functions. We further propose a two-stage template mining algorithm that characterizes the sequential patterns of these events to serve as labeling function templates for efficient data labeling. The visual interface of VideoPro facilitates multifaceted exploration, examination, and application of the labeling templates, allowing for effective programming of video data at scale. Moreover, users can monitor the impact of programming on model performance and make informed adjustments during the iterative programming process.

Class probabilities represent the likelihood that each instance belongs to a particular class, which can be produced by probabilistic classifiers or even human labeling with uncertainty. Since both perspectives are multi-dimensional data, dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques are commonly used to extract informative characteristics from them. However, existing methods either focus solely on the data feature perspective or rely on class probability estimates to guide the DR process. In contrast to previous work where separate views are linked to conduct the analysis, we propose a novel approach, class-constrained t-SNE, that combines data features and class probabilities in the same DR result. Specifically, we combine them by balancing two corresponding components in a cost function to optimize the positions of data points and iconic representation of classes – class landmarks. Furthermore, an interactive user-adjustable parameter balances these two components so that users can focus on the weighted perspectives of interest and also empowers a smooth visual transition between varying perspectives to preserve the mental map. We illustrate its application potential in model evaluation and visual-interactive labeling. A comparative analysis is performed to evaluate the DR results.","article_number":"10294259","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10294259","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10294259/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10294259/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"164","end_page":"174","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":346,"insert_date":"20231024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Data models","Visualization","Analytical models","Labeling","Cost function","Periodic structures"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Dimensionality reduction","t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding","constraint integration"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Characteristics Of Data","Features Of Data","Class Probabilities","Dimensionality Reduction","Cost Function","Multidimensional Data","Multidimensional Analysis","Position Of Point","Smooth Transition","Probabilistic Classification","High-dimensional","High-dimensional Space","Similarity Matrix","Similarity Matrices","Main Clusters","Baseline Methods","Low-dimensional Space","Lower-dimensional Space","Topic Modeling","Original Space","Probabilistic Method","Pairwise Similarity","Visual Patterns","Dimensionality Reduction Methods","Degree Of Separation","Labeling Process","Instance Selection","Clustering Visualization","Projection Views","Single Degree Of Freedom","Landmark Localization","Landmark Positions","Classical Clustering","2D Space","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Data In Feature Space"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326517","title":"MeTACAST: Target- and Context-Aware Spatial Selection in VR","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":25,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088639101","id":37088639101,"full_name":"Lixiang Zhao","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LISN, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37297057400","id":37297057400,"full_name":"Tobias Isenberg","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LISN, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087733763","id":37087733763,"full_name":"Fuqi Xie","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085354586","id":37085354586,"full_name":"Hai-Ning Liang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593898200","id":37593898200,"full_name":"Lingyun Yu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We propose three novel spatial data selection techniques for particle data in VR visualization environments.

Each technique is designed to be adjusted to particular selection intents: the selection of consecutive dense regions, the selection of filament-like structures, and the selection of clusters—with all of them facilitating post-selection threshold adjustment. These techniques allow users to precisely select those regions of space for further exploration—with simple and approximate 3D pointing, brushing, or drawing input—using flexible point- or path-based input and without being limited by 3D occlusions, non-homogeneous feature density, or complex data shapes. These new techniques are evaluated in a controlled experiment and compared with the Baseline method, a region-based 3D painting selection. Our results indicate that our techniques are effective in handling a wide range of scenarios and allow users to select data based on their comprehension of crucial features. Furthermore, we analyze the attributes, requirements, and strategies of our spatial selection methods and compare them with existing state-of-the-art selection methods to handle diverse data features and situations. Based on this analysis we provide guidelines for choosing the most suitable 3D spatial selection techniques based on the interaction environment, the given data characteristics, or the need for interactive post-selection threshold adjustment.","article_number":"10292508","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10292508","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292508/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292508/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"480","end_page":"494","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":363,"insert_date":"20231023","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three-dimensional displays","Shape","Density measurement","Volume measurement","Data visualization","Particle measurements","Spatial databases"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Spatial selection","immersive analytics","virtual reality (VR)","target-aware and context-aware interaction for visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Spatial Selectivity","Interactive","Characteristics Of Data","Features Of Data","Selection Method","Complex Data","Selection Techniques","Baseline Methods","Crucial Feature","Crucial Characteristics","Spatial Techniques","Control Levels","Selection Strategy","Selection Scheme","Cognitive Load","Cognitive Demands","Mental Workload","Mental Effort","Target Selection","Local Maxima","Completion Time","Point Cloud","3D Space","3-dimensional Space","Uniform Density","Uniform Measure","Uniform Probability Distribution","Rectangular Distribution","User Input","Point Cloud Data","Immersive Environment","User Selection","Non-uniform Density","Precise Input","Input Precision","Physical Workload","Region-based Methods","Registration-based Method","Input Position","Ray Casting","Ray Shooting","Average Completion Time","User Preferences"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326579","title":"Vistrust: a Multidimensional Framework and Empirical Study of Trust in Data Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":26,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"UMass Amherst, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089213488","id":37089213488,"full_name":"Hamza Elhamdadi","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UMass Amherst, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"HUN-REN Centre for Social Sciences, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/756015693970523","id":756015693970523,"full_name":"Adam Stefkovics","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["HUN-REN Centre for Social Sciences, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37409575800","id":37409575800,"full_name":"Johanna Beyer","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard Medical School, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/725943612480529","id":725943612480529,"full_name":"Eric Moerth","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard Medical School, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275698100","id":37275698100,"full_name":"Hanspeter Pfister","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"UMass Amherst, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/682117693233631","id":682117693233631,"full_name":"Cindy Xiong Bearfield","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UMass Amherst, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Toronto, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399400500","id":37399400500,"full_name":"Carolina Nobre","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Toronto, Canada"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Trust is an essential aspect of data visualization, as it plays a crucial role in the interpretation and decision-making processes of users. While research in social sciences outlines the multi-dimensional factors that can play a role in trust formation, most data visualization trust researchers employ a single-item scale to measure trust. We address this gap by proposing a comprehensive, multidimensional conceptualization and operationalization of trust in visualization. We do this by applying general theories of trust from social sciences, as well as synthesizing and extending earlier work and factors identified by studies in the visualization field. We apply a two-dimensional approach to trust in visualization, to distinguish between cognitive and affective elements, as well as between visualization and data-specific trust antecedents. We use our framework to design and run a large crowd-sourced study to quantify the role of visual complexity in establishing trust in science visualizations. Our study provides empirical evidence for several aspects of our proposed theoretical framework, most notably the impact of cognition, affective responses, and individual differences when establishing trust in visualizations.","article_number":"10308716","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10308716","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10308716/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10308716/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"348","end_page":"358","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":307,"insert_date":"20231103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Games","Particle measurements","Atmospheric measurements","Visualization","Investment","Computer science"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Trust","visualization","science","framework"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Visualization","Study Of Trust","Trust Framework","Social Sciences","Individual Differences","Complex Role","Affective Responses","Affective Reactions","Social Science Research","Multidimensional Concept","Trust Research","Visual Complexity","Trust Formation","Affective Elements","Concept Of Trust","Level Of Complexity","Complex Effects","Bar Charts","Need For Cognition","Need For Knowledge","Trust In Institutions","Interpersonal Trust","Data Trust","Trust In Science","Chart Types","Trust Game","Measures Of Trust","Line Chart","Affective Cues","Visual Clarity","Unidimensional Scale","Development Of Trust"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327354","title":"Mystique: Deconstructing SVG Charts for Layout Reuse","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":27,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089174451","id":37089174451,"full_name":"Chen Chen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research, Redmond, Washington, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37293389400","id":37293389400,"full_name":"Bongshin Lee","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research, Redmond, Washington, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Shandong University, Qingdao, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085804605","id":37085804605,"full_name":"Yunhai Wang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shandong University, Qingdao, China"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087599230","id":37087599230,"full_name":"Yunjeong Chang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592993600","id":37592993600,"full_name":"Zhicheng Liu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, United States"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"To facilitate the reuse of existing charts, previous research has examined how to obtain a semantic understanding of a chart by deconstructing its visual representation into reusable components, such as encodings.

In this paper, we investigate how to deconstruct chart layouts, focusing on rectangle-based ones, as they cover not only 17 chart types but also advanced layouts (e.g., small multiples, nested layouts). We develop an interactive tool, called Mystique, adopting a mixed-initiative approach to extract the axes and legend, and deconstruct a chart's layout into four semantic components: mark groups, spatial relationships, data encodings, and graphical constraints. Mystique employs a wizard interface that guides chart authors through a series of steps to specify how the deconstructed components map to their own data. On 150 rectangle-based SVG charts, Mystique achieves above 85% accuracy for axis and legend extraction and 96% accuracy for layout deconstruction. In a chart reproduction study, participants could easily reuse existing charts on new datasets. We discuss the current limitations of Mystique and future research directions.","article_number":"10297572","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10297572","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10297572/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10297572/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"447","end_page":"457","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":183,"insert_date":"20231026","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Layout","Data visualization","Bars","Visualization","Data mining","Encoding","Semantics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Chart layout","Reuse","Reverse-engineering","Deconstruction"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Filtering Effect","Scalable Vector Graphics","Visual Representation","Deconstruction","Interactive Tool","Semantic Components","Chart Types","Distance Matrix","Distance Matrices","Object Detection","Bounding Box","Bar Charts","Infographic","Graphical Display","Error Detection","Line Element","Absolute Position","Absolute Location","Treemap","Functional Tree","Performance Of Trees","Simple Interaction","Visual Design","Drop-down Menu","Positional Encoding","Stacked Bar","Visual Channels","Scene Graph","Visual Style","Axis Labels","Visual Encoding","Stacked Bar Charts","Field Data","Composite Design","Trade Value"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326584","title":"MolSieve: A Progressive Visual Analytics System for Molecular Dynamics Simulations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":28,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Arizona State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/437679209573854","id":437679209573854,"full_name":"Rostyslav Hnatyshyn","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087479636","id":37087479636,"full_name":"Jieqiong Zhao","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086419183","id":37086419183,"full_name":"Danny Perez","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282713700","id":37282713700,"full_name":"James Ahrens","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396008400","id":37396008400,"full_name":"Ross Maciejewski","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are ubiquitous in cutting-edge physio-chemical research. They provide critical insights into how a physical system evolves over time given a model of interatomic interactions. Understanding a system's evolution is key to selecting the best candidates for new drugs, materials for manufacturing, and countless other practical applications. With today's technology, these simulations can encompass millions of unit transitions between discrete molecular structures, spanning up to several milliseconds of real time. Attempting to perform a brute-force analysis with data-sets of this size is not only computationally impractical, but would not shed light on the physically-relevant features of the data. Moreover, there is a need to analyze simulation ensembles in order to compare similar processes in differing environments. These problems call for an approach that is analytically transparent, computationally efficient, and flexible enough to handle the variety found in materials-based research. In order to address these problems, we introduce MolSieve, a progressive visual analytics system that enables the comparison of multiple long-duration simulations. Using MolSieve, analysts are able to quickly identify and compare regions of interest within immense simulations through its combination of control charts, data-reduction techniques, and highly informative visual components. A simple programming interface is provided which allows experts to fit MolSieve to their needs.

Text-guided generation methods are emerging, but may have limited applicability due to their predefined entities. In this work, we propose ChartSpark, a novel system that embeds semantic context into chart based on text-to-image generative models. ChartSpark generates pictorial visualizations conditioned on both semantic context conveyed in textual inputs and data information embedded in plain charts. The method is generic for both foreground and background pictorial generation, satisfying the design practices identified from empirical research into existing pictorial visualizations.

Effective documentation for explaining chart findings during the exploration process is essential as it helps recall and share data analysis. However, documenting chart findings remains a challenge due to its time-consuming and tedious nature. While existing automatic methods alleviate some of the burden on users, they often fail to cater to users' specific interests. In response to these limitations, we present InkSight, a mixed-initiative computational notebook plugin that generates finding documentation based on the user's intent. InkSight allows users to express their intent in specific data subsets through sketching atop visualizations intuitively. To facilitate this, we designed two types of sketches, i.e., open-path and closed-path sketch. Upon receiving a user's sketch, InkSight identifies the sketch type and corresponding selected data items. Subsequently, it filters data fact types based on the sketch and selected data items before employing existing automatic data fact recommendation algorithms to infer data facts. Using large language models (GPT-3.5), InkSight converts data facts into effective natural language documentation. Users can conveniently fine-tune the generated documentation within InkSight. A user study with 12 participants demonstrated the usability and effectiveness of InkSight in expressing user intent and facilitating chart finding documentation.","article_number":"10296056","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10296056","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10296056/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10296056/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"944","end_page":"954","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":249,"insert_date":"20231025","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Documentation","Data analysis","Visualization","Codes","Natural languages","Data models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Computational Notebook","Sketch-based Interaction","Documentation","Visualization","Exploratory Data Analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Computational Notebooks","Usability","Ease Of Use","Natural Language","Subset Of Data","User Study","Exploratory Data","Exploration Process","Usage Intention","Effective Tool","Group Data","Hierarchical Structure","Hierarchical Organization","Quantitative Results","Quantitative Outcomes","Cognitive Load","Cognitive Demands","Mental Workload","Mental Effort","Top Panel","Visual Analysis","Flexible Way","Interaction Module","Visual Elements","Automatic Generation","Qualitative Feedback","Jupyter Notebook","Calculation Module","Computation Module","Visual Analysis Of Data","Open Path","Documentation Process","Text Generation","Sentence Generation","Natural Language Generation","Line Chart","Data Analysis Workflow","Interaction Design","Chart Types"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326599","title":"Scalable Hypergraph Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":31,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/660264449698881","id":660264449698881,"full_name":"Peter Oliver","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37398562200","id":37398562200,"full_name":"Eugene Zhang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085665492","id":37085665492,"full_name":"Yue Zhang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Hypergraph visualization has many applications in network data analysis. Recently, a polygon-based representation for hypergraphs has been proposed with demonstrated benefits. However, the polygon-based layout often suffers from excessive self-intersections when the input dataset is relatively large. In this paper, we propose a framework in which the hypergraph is iteratively simplified through a set of atomic operations. Then, the layout of the simplest hypergraph is optimized and used as the foundation for a reverse process that brings the simplest hypergraph back to the original one, but with an improved layout. At the core of our approach is the set of atomic simplification operations and an operation priority measure to guide the simplification process. In addition, we introduce necessary definitions and conditions for hypergraph planarity within the polygon representation. We extend our approach to handle simultaneous simplification and layout optimization for both the hypergraph and its dual. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with datasets from a number of real-world applications.","article_number":"10290912","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10290912","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10290912/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10290912/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"595","end_page":"605","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":243,"insert_date":"20231023","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Atomic measurements","Data analysis","Layout","Data visualization","Optimization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Hypergraph visualization","scalable visualization","polygon layout","hypergraph embedding","primal-dual visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Simple Process","Simple Operation","Set Of Operations","Layout Optimization","Linearizable","Atomic Actions","Atomic Operations","Iterative Process","Original Scale","Legality","Betweenness Centrality","Trade Agreements","Trade Deals","Visibility Graph","Inverse Operation","Simple Scaling","Pair Of Elements","Vertex Degree","Vertices Of Degree","Pair Of Vertices","Vertex Pairs","Intermediate Scale","Multi-scale Representation","Planar Graphs","Planar Maps","Visual Metaphors","Regional Trade Agreements","International Trade Agreements","Priority Queue","Removal Operation","Multiscale Framework","Eye-tracking","Polygon Area","Small Economy","Cardinality","Set Size","Optimization Framework"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327366","title":"Attribute-Aware RBFs: Interactive Visualization of Time Series Particle Volumes Using RT Core Range Queries","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":32,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087129005","id":37087129005,"full_name":"Nate Morrical","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Cologne, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087079401","id":37087079401,"full_name":"Stefan Zellmann","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Cologne, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089172194","id":37089172194,"full_name":"Alper Sahistan","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Argonne National Laboratory, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/375299204237176","id":375299204237176,"full_name":"Patrick Shriwise","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Argonne National Laboratory, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/243896709558197","id":243896709558197,"full_name":"Valerio Pascucci","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is a mesh-free method used to simulate volumetric media in fluids, astrophysics, and solid mechanics. Visualizing these simulations is problematic because these datasets often contain millions, if not billions of particles carrying physical attributes and moving over time. Radial basis functions (RBFs) are used to model particles, and overlapping particles are interpolated to reconstruct a high-quality volumetric field; however, this interpolation process is expensive and makes interactive visualization difficult. Existing RBF interpolation schemes do not account for color-mapped attributes and are instead constrained to visualizing just the density field. To address these challenges, we exploit ray tracing cores in modern GPU architectures to accelerate scalar field reconstruction. We use a novel RBF interpolation scheme to integrate per-particle colors and densities, and leverage GPU-parallel tree construction and refitting to quickly update the tree as the simulation animates over time or when the user manipulates particle radii. We also propose a Hilbert reordering scheme to cluster particles together at the leaves of the tree to reduce tree memory consumption. Finally, we reduce the noise of volumetric shadows by adopting a spatially temporal blue noise sampling scheme. Our method can provide a more detailed and interactive view of these large, volumetric, time-series particle datasets than traditional methods, leading to new insights into these physics simulations.","article_number":"10296023","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10296023","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10296023/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10296023/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"1150","end_page":"1160","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":200,"insert_date":"20231025","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Ray tracing","Graphics processing units","Rendering (computer graphics)","Data visualization","Color","Time series analysis","Memory management"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Ray Tracing","Volume Rendering","Particle Volumes","Radial Basis Functions","Scientific Visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Time Series","Radial Basis Function","Particle Volume","Interactive Visualization","Range Query","Interpolation","Density Field","Particle Radius","Particle Radii","Memory Consumption","Ray Tracing","Physical Simulation","Field Reconstruction","Meshless Method","Reproducing Kernel Particle Method","Meshfree Methods","Mesh-free Method","Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics","Right-hand Side","Cluster Size","Points In Space","Bounding Box","Particle Density","Hardware Accelerators","Adaptive Mesh Refinement","P-refinement","Volume Rendering","Volumetric Rendering","Color Map","Query Point","Kernel Computation","Kernel Calculation","Preprocessing Time","Beer-Lambert","Lambert-Beer","Beer Lambert Law","Increasing Cluster Size","Depth-first","Depth First Search"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327387","title":"InnovationInsights: A Visual Analytics Approach for Understanding the Dual Frontiers of Science and Technology","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":33,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"The Center for Science of Science and Innovation, Northwestern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102546","id":37087102546,"full_name":"Yifang Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The Center for Science of Science and Innovation, Northwestern University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"The Center for Science of Science and Innovation, Northwestern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089352224","id":37089352224,"full_name":"Yifan Qian","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The Center for Science of Science and Innovation, Northwestern University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089029729","id":37089029729,"full_name":"Xiaoyu Qi","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604309600","id":37604309600,"full_name":"Nan Cao","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"The Center for Science of Science and Innovation, Northwestern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085829911","id":37085829911,"full_name":"Dashun Wang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The Center for Science of Science and Innovation, Northwestern University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Science has long been viewed as a key driver of economic growth and rising standards of living. Knowledge about how scientific advances support marketplace inventions is therefore essential for understanding the role of science in propelling real-world applications and technological progress. The increasing availability of large-scale datasets tracing scientific publications and patented inventions and the complex interactions among them offers us new opportunities to explore the evolving dual frontiers of science and technology at an unprecedented level of scale and detail. However, we lack suitable visual analytics approaches to analyze such complex interactions effectively. Here we introduce InnovationInsights, an interactive visual analysis system for researchers, research institutions, and policymakers to explore the complex linkages between science and technology, and to identify critical innovations, inventors, and potential partners. The system first identifies important associations between scientific papers and patented inventions through a set of statistical measures introduced by our experts from the field of the Science of Science. A series of visualization views are then used to present these associations in the data context. In particular, we introduce the Interplay Graph to visualize patterns and insights derived from the data, helping users effectively navigate citation relationships between papers and patents. This visualization thereby helps them identify the origins of technical inventions and the impact of scientific research. We evaluate the system through two case studies with experts followed by expert interviews. We further engage a premier research institution to test-run the system, helping its institution leaders to extract new insights for innovation. Through both the case studies and the engagement project, we find that our system not only meets our original goals of design, allowing users to better identify the sources of technical inventions and to understand the broad impact of scientific research; it also goes beyond these purposes to enable an array of new applications for researchers and research institutions, ranging from identifying untapped innovation potential within an institution to forging new collaboration opportunities between science and industry.","article_number":"10296058","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10296058","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10296058/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10296058/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"518","end_page":"528","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":369,"insert_date":"20231025","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Patents","Technological innovation","Visual analytics","Collaboration","Stakeholders","Industries"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Science of Science","Innovation","Academic Profiles","Patent Data","Publication Data","Visual Analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Science And Technology","Visual Analysis","Technological Frontier","Interactive","Scientific Research","Research Institute","Complex Interactions","Field Of Science","Scientific Disciplines","Visual System","Scientific Advances","Scientific Papers","Opportunities For Collaboration","Expert Interviews","Visual Approach","Innovation Potential","Engagement In Projects","Prediction Model","Year Of Publication","Knowledge Transfer","Knowledge Flows","Transmission Of Knowledge","Patent Citations","Graph Convolutional Network","Graph Convolutional Neural Network","Number Of Papers","Technology Transfer Offices","Number Of Citations","Mixed Reality","Patent Data","Opportunities For Innovation","Citation Network","Total Number Of Papers"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327161","title":"VIRD: Immersive Match Video Analysis for High-Performance Badminton Coaching","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":34,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Harvard John A.

To gain a competitive edge at high-level competitions, badminton professionals frequently analyze match videos to gain insights and develop game strategies. However, the current process for analyzing matches is time-consuming and relies heavily on manual note-taking, due to the lack of automatic data collection and appropriate visualization tools. As a result, there is a gap in effectively analyzing matches and communicating insights among badminton coaches and players. This work proposes an end-to-end immersive match analysis pipeline designed in close collaboration with badminton professionals, including Olympic and national coaches and players. We present VIRD, a VR Bird (i.e., shuttle) immersive analysis tool, that supports interactive badminton game analysis in an immersive environment based on 3D reconstructed game views of the match video. We propose a top-down analytic workflow that allows users to seamlessly move from a high-level match overview to a detailed game view of individual rallies and shots, using situated 3D visualizations and video. We collect 3D spatial and dynamic shot data and player poses with computer vision models and visualize them in VR. Through immersive visualizations, coaches can interactively analyze situated spatial data (player positions, poses, and shot trajectories) with flexible viewpoints while navigating between shots and rallies effectively with embodied interaction. We evaluated the usefulness of VIRD with Olympic and national-level coaches and players in real matches. Results show that immersive analytics supports effective badminton match analysis with reduced context-switching costs and enhances spatial understanding with a high sense of presence.","article_number":"10296031","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10296031","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10296031/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10296031/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"458","end_page":"468","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":375,"insert_date":"20231025","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Sports","Games","Data visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Trajectory","Training","Spatial databases"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Sports Analytics","Immersive Analytics","Data Visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Coaching","Video Analysis","Video Classification","Matching Video","Interactive","Computer Vision","Kinetic Data","Dynamic Data","3D Data","Matching Analysis","3D Visualization","Immersive Environment","Automated Data Collection","Automatic Collection","Heatmap","Top-down Approach","Top-down Model","Domain Experts","Pose Estimation","Spatial Aspects","Dynamics Trajectories","Top-down Analysis","Professional Coaches","Spatial Visualization","Round Of Testing","Current Workflow","Manual Collection","Player Movement","Team Players","360-degree Video","Omnidirectional Video","Immersive Video","First-person View"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326574","title":"Perceptually Uniform Construction of Illustrative Textures","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":35,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Jena, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/360098198030133","id":360098198030133,"full_name":"Anna Sterzik","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Jena, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085898826","id":37085898826,"full_name":"Monique Meuschke","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Magdeburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Brandenburg University of Technology, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/198368999477373","id":198368999477373,"full_name":"Douglas W.

Recently, the potential of encoding information on surfaces or maps using different densities has also been recognized. This has the significant advantage that additional color can be used as another visual channel and the illustrative textures can then be overlaid. Effectively, it is thus possible to display multiple information, such as two different scalar fields on surfaces simultaneously. In previous work, these textures were manually generated and the choice of density was unempirically determined. Here, we first want to determine and understand the perceptual space of illustrative textures. We chose a succession of simplices with increasing dimensions as primitives for our textures: Dots, lines, and triangles. Thus, we explore the texture types of stippling, hatching, and triangles. We create a range of textures by sampling the density space uniformly. Then, we conduct three perceptual studies in which the participants performed pairwise comparisons for each texture type. We use multidimensional scaling (MDS) to analyze the perceptual spaces per category. The perception of stippling and triangles seems relatively similar. Both are adequately described by a 1D manifold in 2D space. The perceptual space of hatching consists of two main clusters: Crosshatched textures, and textures with only one hatching direction.

Such studies can provide insights into the underlying factors affecting children's health and aid in the development of targeted interventions to improve their health outcomes. However, with the availability of multiple data sources, including context data (i.e., the background information of children) and motion data (i.e., sensor data measuring activities of children), new challenges have arisen due to the large-scale, heterogeneous, and multimodal nature of the data. Existing statistical hypothesis-based and learning model-based approaches have been inadequate for comprehensively analyzing the complex correlation between multimodal features and multi-dimensional health outcomes due to the limited information revealed. In this work, we first distill a set of design requirements from multiple levels through conducting a literature review and iteratively interviewing 11 experts from multiple domains (e.g., public health and medicine). Then, we propose HealthPrism, an interactive visual and analytics system for assisting researchers in exploring the importance and influence of various context and motion features on children's health status from multi-level perspectives. Within HealthPrism, a multimodal learning model with a gate mechanism is proposed for health profiling and cross-modality feature importance comparison. A set of visualization components is designed for experts to explore and understand multimodal data freely. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of HealthPrism through quantitative evaluation of the model performance, case studies, and expert interviews in associated domains.","article_number":"10294211","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10294211","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10294211/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10294211/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"1205","end_page":"1215","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":328,"insert_date":"20231024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Artificial intelligence","TV","Sun","Correlation","Germanium","Visual analytics","Pediatrics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analytics","Health Profiling","Multimodal Learning","Context Data","Motion Data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Mental Health","Visual Analysis","Health Profile","Visual Analytics System","Mental Health Profiles","Health Status","Health Conditions","Health Outcomes","Learning Models","Child Health","Health Of Children","Important Characteristics","Feature Importance","Visual System","Sensor Data","Importance Of Context","Influence Of Characteristics","Influence Of Features","Design Requirements","Motion Features","Motion Characteristics","Interactive Visualization","Gating Mechanism","Expert Interviews","Motion Patterns","Visualization Tool","Comparison Cohort","Health Indicators","Health Index","Visual Design","Learning Module","Output Gate","Machine Learning Models","Visual Analytics Tool","Psychosocial Functioning"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326523","title":"Perception of Line Attributes for Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":37,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Jena, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/360098198030133","id":360098198030133,"full_name":"Anna Sterzik","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Jena, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Tübingen, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102378","id":37087102378,"full_name":"Nils Lichtenberg","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Tübingen, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Jena, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/383438369748525","id":383438369748525,"full_name":"Jana Wilms","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Jena, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Tübingen, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37885145500","id":37885145500,"full_name":"Michael Krone","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Tübingen, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Brandenburg University of Technology, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/198368999477373","id":198368999477373,"full_name":"Douglas W.

However, many questions on the perception of line attributes remain, such as how many levels of attribute variation can be distinguished or which line attributes are the preferred choices for which tasks. We conducted three studies to develop guidelines for using stylized lines to encode scalar data. In our first study, participants drew stylized lines to encode uncertainty information. Uncertainty is usually visualized alongside other data. Therefore, alternative visual channels are important for the visualization of uncertainty. Additionally, uncertainty—e.g., in weather forecasts—is a familiar topic to most people. Thus, we picked it for our visualization scenarios in study 1. We used the results of our study to determine the most common line attributes for drawing uncertainty: Dashing, luminance, wave amplitude, and width. While those line attributes were especially common for drawing uncertainty, they are also commonly used in other areas. In studies 2 and 3, we investigated the discriminability of the line attributes determined in study 1. Studies 2 and 3 did not require specific application areas; thus, their results apply to visualizing any scalar data in line attributes. We evaluated the just-noticeable differences (JND) and derived recommendations for perceptually distinct line levels. We found that participants could discriminate considerably more levels for the line attribute width than for wave amplitude, dashing, or luminance.","article_number":"10292709","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10292709","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292709/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292709/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"1041","end_page":"1051","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":157,"insert_date":"20231023","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty","Data visualization","Visualization","Encoding","Task analysis","Shape","Image color analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Line Drawings","Line Stylization","Perceptual Evaluation","Uncertainty Visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Perceptual Dimensions","Perceptual Attributes","Perceptual Properties","Wave Amplitude","Distinct Levels","Uncertainty Information","Just Noticeable Difference","Visual Channels","Linear Model","Linear Regression Model","Hatching","Visual Arts","Development Of Imaging","Line Length","Popular Choice","Line Drawings","Additional Channels","Attribute Levels","Level Of Properties","Uncertain Data","Weber Fraction","Ranking Task"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326934","title":"Cluster-Aware Grid Layout","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":38,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089651046","id":37089651046,"full_name":"Yuxing Zhou","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088637276","id":37088637276,"full_name":"Weikai Yang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089356930","id":37089356930,"full_name":"Jiashu Chen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Kuaishou Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086544275","id":37086544275,"full_name":"Changjian Chen","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Kuaishou Technology, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/856588946366105","id":856588946366105,"full_name":"Zhiyang Shen","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Guilin University of Electronic Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399486700","id":37399486700,"full_name":"Xiaonan Luo","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Guilin University of Electronic Technology, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593898200","id":37593898200,"full_name":"Lingyun Yu","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406039100","id":37406039100,"full_name":"Shixia Liu","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Grid visualizations are widely used in many applications to visually explain a set of data and their proximity relationships.

To address this issue, we propose a cluster-aware grid layout method that aims to better preserve cluster structures by simultaneously considering proximity, compactness, and convexity in the optimization process. Our method utilizes a hybrid optimization strategy that consists of two phases. The global phase aims to balance proximity and compactness within each cluster, while the local phase ensures the convexity of cluster shapes. We evaluate the proposed grid layout method through a series of quantitative experiments and two use cases, demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving cluster structures and facilitating analysis tasks.","article_number":"10292929","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10292929","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292929/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292929/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"240","end_page":"250","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":305,"insert_date":"20231023","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Area measurement","Shape","Layout","Shape measurement","Particle measurements","Atmospheric measurements","Correlation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Grid layout","similarity","convexity","compactness","optimization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Grid Layout","Cluster Structure","Local Phase","Global Phase","Cluster Shape","Area Ratio","User Study","Grid Cells","Original System","Grid Size","Cluster Centers","Line Segment","Levels Of Hierarchy","Convex Hull","Perceptions Of People","Voronoi Diagram","Voronoi Tessellation","Voronoi Cell","2D Space","Ranking Results","Convex Shape","Shape Area","Area-based Measures","Perimeter Ratio","Bipartite Matching","Boundary Changes","Gestalt Principles","Gestalt Perception","Gestalt Theory","Gestalt Psychology","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Supplemental Material","Friedman Test","Convex Polygon"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327368","title":"Unraveling the Design Space of Immersive Analytics: A Systematic Review","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":39,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Northeastern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087236804","id":37087236804,"full_name":"David Saffo","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University, USA","J.P.

This paper presents a systematic literature review of 73 studies published between 2013-2022 on immersive analytics systems and visualizations, aiming to identify and categorize the primary dimensions influencing their design. We identified five key dimensions:  Academic Theory and Contribution,  Immersive Technology,  Data,  Spatial Presentation, and  Visual Presentation. Academic Theory and Contribution assess the motivations behind the works and their theoretical frameworks. Immersive Technology examines the display and input modalities, while Data dimension focuses on dataset types and generation. Spatial Presentation discusses the environment, space, embodiment, and collaboration aspects in IA, and Visual Presentation explores the visual elements, facet and position, and manipulation of views. By examining each dimension individually and cross-referencing them, this review uncovers trends and relationships that help inform the design of immersive systems visualizations. This analysis provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners, offering guidance in designing future immersive analytics systems and shaping the trajectory of this rapidly evolving field.

Existing dashboard design guidelines, however, are often unable to account for this expanded scope as they largely focus on best practices for visual design. In contrast, we frame dashboard design as facilitating an analytical conversation: a cooperative, interactive experience where a user may interact with, reason about, or freely query the underlying data. By drawing on established principles of conversational flow and communication, we define the concept of a cooperative dashboard as one that enables a fruitful and productive analytical conversation, and derive a set of 39 dashboard design heuristics to support effective analytical conversations. To assess the utility of this framing, we asked 52 computer science and engineering graduate students to apply our heuristics to critique and design dashboards as part of an ungraded, opt-in homework assignment. Feedback from participants demonstrates that our heuristics surface new reasons dashboards may fail, and encourage a more fluid, supportive, and responsive style of dashboard design. Our approach suggests several compelling directions for future work, including dashboard authoring tools that better anticipate conversational turn-taking, repair, and refinement and extending cooperative principles to other analytical workflows.","article_number":"10297573","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10297573","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10297573/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10297573/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"370","end_page":"380","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":526,"insert_date":"20231026","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Oral communication","Data visualization","Guidelines","Visualization","Maintenance engineering","Surveys","Grounding"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Gricean maxims","interactive visualization","conversation initiation","grounding","turn-taking","repair and refinement"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Goal Of Analysis","Visual Design","Homework Assignments","Communication Goals","Principles Of Cooperation","Heuristic Design","Complex Formation","Spreadsheet","Natural Language","Visual Analysis","Analysis Tasks","Application Rate","Iconography","New Lines Of Research","New Lines Of Enquiry","Vague Concept","Use Of Heuristics","Conversational Interactions","Set Of Heuristics","Chatbot","Reflective Exercises","Onboarding","Heuristic Evaluation","Chart Types","Thematic Analysis Of Responses"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327155","title":"Why Change My Design: Explaining Poorly Constructed Visualization Designs with Explorable Explanations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":43,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087126870","id":37087126870,"full_name":"Leo Yu-Ho Lo","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089155935","id":37089155935,"full_name":"Yifan Cao","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102860","id":37087102860,"full_name":"Leni Yang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Although visualization tools are widely available and accessible, not everyone knows the best practices and guidelines for creating accurate and honest visual representations of data. Numerous books and articles have been written to expose the misleading potential of poorly constructed charts and teach people how to avoid being deceived by them or making their own mistakes. These readings use various rhetorical devices to explain the concepts to their readers. In our analysis of a collection of books, online materials, and a design workshop, we identified six common explanation methods. To assess the effectiveness of these methods, we conducted two crowdsourced studies (each with $N=125$) to evaluate their ability to teach and persuade people to make design changes. In addition to these existing methods, we brought in the idea of Explorable Explanations, which allows readers to experiment with different chart settings and observe how the changes are reflected in the visualization. While we did not find significant differences across explanation methods, the results of our experiments indicate that, following the exposure to the explanations, the participants showed improved proficiency in identifying deceptive charts and were more receptive to proposed alterations of the visualization design. We discovered that participants were willing to accept more than 60% of the proposed adjustments in the persuasiveness assessment. Nevertheless, we found no significant differences among different explanation methods in convincing participants to accept the modifications.","article_number":"10299537","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10299537","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10299537/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10299537/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"955","end_page":"964","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":203,"insert_date":"20231027","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Best practices","Fake news","Social networking (online)","Guidelines","Education"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Information Visualization","Deceptive Visualization","Explorable Explanations"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Design","Best Practices","Persuasive","Persuade","Crowdsourcing","Visualization Tool","Exploratory Methods","Design Workshops","Social Media Platforms","Design Choices","Explanation For Effects","Pie Chart","Recommender Systems","Visual Aids","Color Scheme","Short Text","Exploratory Technique","Line Chart","Post Phase","Post-intervention Phase","Explanatory Text","Choropleth Maps","Correct Version","Rainbow Color","Chart Types","Post-intervention Test","Visual Explanation","Hourly Rate","Grounded Theory Method","Inappropriate Use","Blog Posts","Social Media","Social Platforms"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327181","title":"VISGRADER: Automatic Grading of D3 Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":44,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089534737","id":37089534737,"full_name":"Matthew Hull","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/758400460507566","id":758400460507566,"full_name":"Vivian Pednekar","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/909948956176295","id":909948956176295,"full_name":"Hannah Murray","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089293609","id":37089293609,"full_name":"Nimisha Roy","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/462402920060178","id":462402920060178,"full_name":"Emmanuel Tung","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/911660030544086","id":911660030544086,"full_name":"Susanta Routray","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/899163443886968","id":899163443886968,"full_name":"Connor Guerin","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/901262602675641","id":901262602675641,"full_name":"Justin Chen","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088660889","id":37088660889,"full_name":"Zijie J.

Ensuring the readability of AR labels requires placing them in an occlusion-free manner while keeping visual links legible, especially when multiple labels exist in the scene. Although existing optimization-based methods, such as force-based methods, are effective in managing AR labels in static scenarios, they often struggle in dynamic scenarios with constantly moving objects. This is due to their focus on generating layouts optimal for the current moment, neglecting future moments and leading to sub-optimal or unstable layouts over time. In this work, we present RL-LABEL, a deep reinforcement learning-based method intended for managing the placement of AR labels in scenarios involving moving objects. RL-LABEL considers both the current and predicted future states of objects and labels, such as positions and velocities, as well as the user's viewpoint, to make informed decisions about label placement. It balances the trade-offs between immediate and long-term objectives. We tested RL-LABEL in simulated AR scenarios on two real-world datasets, showing that it effectively learns the decision-making process for long-term optimization, outperforming two baselines (i.e., no view management and a force-based method) by minimizing label occlusions, line intersections, and label movement distance. Additionally, a user study involving 18 participants indicates that, within our simulated environment, RL-LABEL excels over the baselines in aiding users to identify, compare, and summarize data on labels in dynamic scenes.","article_number":"10290983","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10290983","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10290983/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10290983/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"1347","end_page":"1357","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":232,"insert_date":"20231023","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three-dimensional displays","Layout","Dynamics","Visualization","Optimization","Task analysis","Sports"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Augmented Reality","Reinforcement Learning","Label Placement","Dynamic Scenarios"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Deep Reinforcement Learning","Dynamic Scenarios","User Study","Future Conditions","Future Status","Future State","Simulation Environment","Real-world Datasets","Objective Conditions","Object State","Objective Status","Intersection Of Line","Dynamic Scenes","Static Scenario","Optimization Problem","Dynamic Environment","Completion Time","Visual Task","Number Of Objects","Target Object","Time In Seconds","Actor Network","Actor-network Theory","Self-driving","Self-driving Cars","Autonomous Cars","Number Of Labels","Mental Load","Label Positions","Reinforcement Learning Methods","Moved To The Left","Visual Search Task","Stable Movement","Critic Network","Objects In The Scene","Object Labels","Reinforcement Learning Model"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326907","title":"Metrics-Based Evaluation and Comparison of Visualization Notations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":46,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"École de technologie supérieure, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089635795","id":37089635795,"full_name":"Nicolas Kruchten","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["École de technologie supérieure, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Chicago, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088599263","id":37088599263,"full_name":"Andrew M.

Programmatic notations use symbols defined by grammars or domain-specific languages (e.g. ggplot2, dplyr, Vega-Lite) or libraries (e.g. Matplotlib, Pandas). Designers and prospective users of grammars and libraries often evaluate visualization notations by inspecting galleries of examples. While such collections demonstrate usage and expressiveness, their construction and evaluation are usually ad hoc, making comparisons of different notations difficult. More rarely, experts analyze notations via usability heuristics, such as the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework. These analyses, akin to structured close readings of text, can reveal design deficiencies, but place a burden on the expert to simultaneously consider many facets of often complex systems. To alleviate these issues, we introduce a metrics-based approach to usability evaluation and comparison of notations in which metrics are computed for a gallery of examples across a suite of notations. While applicable to any visualization domain, we explore the utility of our approach via a case study considering statistical graphics that explores 40 visualizations across 9 widely used notations. We facilitate the computation of appropriate metrics and analysis via a new tool called NotaScope. We gathered feedback via interviews with authors or maintainers of prominent charting libraries ($n=6$). We find that this approach is a promising way to formalize, externalize, and extend evaluations and comparisons of visualization notations.","article_number":"10294197","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10294197","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10294197/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10294197/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"425","end_page":"435","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":192,"insert_date":"20231024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Measurement","Usability","Data visualization","Visualization","Libraries","Task analysis","Grammar"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Notation","Usability","Evaluation","Language design","API design","Domain-specific languages"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Usability","Ease Of Use","Data Transformation","Matplotlib","Statistical Graphics","Calculation Of Metrics","Computation Of Metrics","Domain-specific Languages","Contralateral","Ipsilateral","Semantic","Semi-structured Interviews","Multiple Ways","Form Of Analysis","Application Programming Interface","Programming Interface","Design Space","Mental Models","Tokenized","Set Of Metrics","Vocabulary Size","Edit Distance","Example Of Selection","Task Domain","Chart Types","Smaller Vocabularies","Style Analysis","Large Vocabulary"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326524","title":"Action-Evaluator: A Visualization Approach for Player Action Evaluation in Soccer","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":47,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100739","id":37087100739,"full_name":"Anqi Cao","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Sports Science, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086448603","id":37086448603,"full_name":"Xiao Xie","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Sports Science, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/671992741968027","id":671992741968027,"full_name":"Mingxu Zhou","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Sports Science, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086236404","id":37086236404,"full_name":"Hui Zhang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Sports Science, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Ministry of Education, School of Computer and Artificial Intelligence, Zhengzhou University, Engineering Research Center of Intelligent Swarm Systems, National Supercomputing Center, Zhengzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396970400","id":37396970400,"full_name":"Mingliang Xu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Ministry of Education, School of Computer and Artificial Intelligence, Zhengzhou University, Engineering Research Center of Intelligent Swarm Systems, National Supercomputing Center, Zhengzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","id":37407308300,"full_name":"Yingcai Wu","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In soccer, player action evaluation provides a fine-grained method to analyze player performance and plays an important role in improving winning chances in future matches.

In this work, we collaborate with soccer analysts and coaches to characterize the domain problems of evaluating player performance based on action scores. We design a tailored visualization of soccer player actions that places the action choice together with the tactic it belongs to as well as the player locations in the same view. Based on the design, we introduce a visual analytics system, Action-Evaluator, to facilitate a comprehensive player action evaluation through player navigation, action investigation, and action explanation.

This decoupling allows interactions to extend and compose freely across different tools, chart types, and analysis goals. DIVI exploits positional relations of marks to detect chart components such as axes and legends, reconstruct scales and view encodings, and infer data fields. DIVI then enumerates candidate transformations across inferred data to perform linking between views. To support dynamic interaction without prior specification, we introduce a taxonomy that formalizes the space of standard interactions by chart element, interaction type, and input event. We demonstrate DIVI's usefulness for rapid data exploration and analysis through a usability study with 13 participants and a diverse gallery of dynamically interactive visualizations, including single chart, multi-view, and cross-tool configurations.","article_number":"10299539","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10299539","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10299539/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10299539/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"403","end_page":"413","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":269,"insert_date":"20231027","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Taxonomy","Visualization","Semantics","Brushes","Navigation","Mice"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Interaction","Visualization Tools","Charts","SVG","Exploratory Data Analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Dynamic Interactions","Types Of Interactions","Field Data","Filtering Effect","Scalable Vector Graphics","User Input","Prior Specification","Chart Types","Input Events","Scatter Plot","Data Visualization","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Bounding Box","Visualization Tool","Deconstruction","Bar Charts","Disambiguation","External Data","Set Of Interactions","Individual Markers","Wide Range Of Tools","Source Tool","Interactive Charts","Matplotlib","Range Of Tools","Visual Encoding","Target Node","Standard Representation","Interaction Techniques","Bigraph","Link Graph"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327203","title":"Data Type Agnostic Visual Sensitivity Analysis","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":49,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"TU Wien, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/413790010240562","id":413790010240562,"full_name":"Nikolaus Piccolotto","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Wien, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Wien, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077691500","id":37077691500,"full_name":"Markus Bögl","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Wien, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Wien, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089003744","id":37089003744,"full_name":"Christoph Muehlmann","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Wien, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Jyväskylä, Finland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945207100","id":37945207100,"full_name":"Klaus Nordhausen","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Jyväskylä, Finland"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Wien, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017354300","id":38017354300,"full_name":"Peter Filzmoser","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Wien, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"VRVis GmbH, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077239600","id":37077239600,"full_name":"Johanna Schmidt","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VRVis GmbH, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Wien, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282584500","id":37282584500,"full_name":"Silvia Miksch","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Wien, Austria"]}}]},"access_type":"CCBY - IEEE is not the copyright holder of this material.

Spatial blind source separation (SBSS) is a model used to analyze spatial data. Designed explicitly for spatial data analysis, it is superior to popular non-spatial methods, like PCA. However, a challenge to its practical use is setting two complex tuning parameters, which requires parameter space analysis. In this paper, we focus on sensitivity analysis (SA). SBSS parameters and outputs are spatial data, which makes SA difficult as few SA approaches in the literature assume such complex data on both sides of the model. Based on the requirements in our design study with statistics experts, we developed a visual analytics prototype for data type agnostic visual sensitivity analysis that fits SBSS and other contexts. The main advantage of our approach is that it requires only dissimilarity measures for parameter settings and outputs (Fig. 1). We evaluated the prototype heuristically with visualization experts and through interviews with two SBSS experts. In addition, we show the transferability of our approach by applying it to microclimate simulations. Study participants could confirm suspected and known parameter-output relations, find surprising associations, and identify parameter subspaces to examine in the future. During our design study and evaluation, we identified challenging future research opportunities.","article_number":"10308617","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10308617","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10308617/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10308617/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"1106","end_page":"1116","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":280,"insert_date":"20231103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Task analysis","Spatial databases","Sensitivity analysis","Analytical models","Data models","Predictive models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","parameter space analysis","sensitivity analysis","spatial blind source separation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Prototype","Parameter Settings","Parameter Space","Complex Parameters","Dissimilarity Measure","Blind Source Separation","Blind Signal Separation","Sensitivity Analysis Approach","Hierarchical Clustering","Hierarchical Cluster Analysis","Air Temperature","Atmospheric Temperature","Surface Temperature","Sensitivity Index","Sensitive Indicator","Local Method","Professional Networks","Complete Linkage","Local Dataset","Target User","Visual Design","Min-max Normalization","Latent Dimensions","Color Hue","Cluster Diameter","Linkage Criterion","Linkage Criteria","Wind Parameters","Salient Patterns","Co-authors Of This Paper","Multivariate Measure","Heuristic Evaluation","Interaction Map","Square Matrix","Square Matrices"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327185","title":"From Shock to Shift: Data Visualization for Constructive Climate Journalism","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":50,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Södertörn University and University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/755528031121224","id":755528031121224,"full_name":"Francesca Morini","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Södertörn University and University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Filmuniversität Babelsberg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/556134346678408","id":556134346678408,"full_name":"Anna Eschenbacher","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Filmuniversität Babelsberg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Filmuniversität Babelsberg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/535022664080398","id":535022664080398,"full_name":"Johanna Hartmann","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Filmuniversität Babelsberg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590950400","id":37590950400,"full_name":"Marian Dörk","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"CCBY - IEEE is not the copyright holder of this material.

Data visualization has assumed a central role in environmental journalism and is often used in data stories to convey the dramatic consequences of climate change and other ecological crises. However, the emphasis on the catastrophic impacts of climate change tends to induce feelings of fear, anxiety, and apathy in readers. Climate mitigation, adaptation, and protection—all highly urgent in the face of the climate crisis—are at risk of being overlooked. These topics are more difficult to communicate as they are hard to convey on varying levels of locality, involve multiple interconnected sectors, and need to be mediated across various channels from the printed newspaper to social media platforms. So far, there has been little research on data visualization to enhance affective engagement with data about climate protection as part of solution-oriented reporting of climate change. With this research we characterize the unique challenges of constructive climate journalism for data visualization and share findings from a research and design study in collaboration with a national newspaper in Germany. Using the affordances and aesthetics of travel postcards, we present Klimakarten, a data journalism project on the progress of climate protection at multiple spatial scales (from national to local), across five key sectors (agriculture, buildings, energy, mobility, and waste), and for print and online use. The findings from quantitative and qualitative analysis of reader feedback confirm our overall approach and suggest implications for future work.","article_number":"10308621","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10308621","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10308621/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10308621/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"1413","end_page":"1423","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":784,"insert_date":"20231103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Meteorology","Journalism","Climate change","Visualization","Complexity theory","Anxiety disorders","Media","Climate change"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Constructive Climate Journalism","Frameworks","Storytelling","Journalism"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Visualization","Climate Journalism","Media Coverage Of Climate Change","Climate Change News","Quantitative Analysis","Climate Change","Social Media","Social Platforms","Climate Change Mitigation","Climate Mitigation","Address Climate Change","Affordances","Multiple Spatial Scales","Data Journalism","Diary Data","Data-driven Journalism","Social Development","Social Change","Political Change","National Level","Local Information","Local Features","Local Characteristics","Climate Data","Part Of Survey","Multidimensional Data","Multidimensional Analysis","User Engagement","Customer Engagement","Design Goals","Reading Group","Personal Relevance","Quantitative Questions","Online Channel","Visual Design","List Of Locations","Local Mode","Reading Newspapers","Visual Metaphors","Political Shifts","Diverse Audiences","Variety Of Audiences","Emotional Involvement"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326521","title":"Visualization According to Statisticians: An Interview Study on the Role of Visualization for Inferential Statistics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":51,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, MD, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37090077605","id":37090077605,"full_name":"Eric Newburger","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, MD, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295438200","id":37295438200,"full_name":"Niklas Elmqvist","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Statisticians are not only one of the earliest professional adopters of data visualization, but also some of its most prolific users. Understanding how these professionals utilize visual representations in their analytic process may shed light on best practices for visual sensemaking. We present results from an interview study involving 18 professional statisticians (19.7 years average in the profession) on three aspects: (1) their use of visualization in their daily analytic work; (2) their mental models of inferential statistical processes; and (3) their design recommendations for how to best represent statistical inferences. Interview sessions consisted of discussing inferential statistics, eliciting participant sketches of suitable visual designs, and finally, a design intervention with our proposed visual designs. We analyzed interview transcripts using thematic analysis and open coding, deriving thematic codes on statistical mindset, analytic process, and analytic toolkit. The key findings for each aspect are as follows: (1) statisticians make extensive use of visualization during all phases of their work (and not just when reporting results); (2) their mental models of inferential methods tend to be mostly visually based; and (3) many statisticians abhor dichotomous thinking. The latter suggests that a multi-faceted visual display of inferential statistics that includes a visual indicator of analytically important effect sizes may help to balance the attributed epistemic power of traditional statistical testing with an awareness of the uncertainty of sensemaking.","article_number":"10290952","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10290952","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10290952/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10290952/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"230","end_page":"239","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":240,"insert_date":"20231023","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Interviews","Visualization","Industries","Encoding","Cognitive science","Codes"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Inferential statistics","qualitative interview study","thematic coding","statistical visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Statistical Inference","Statistical Tests","Visual Representation","Inference Methods","Visual Design","Statistical Significance","Exploratory Analysis","Exploratory Data Analysis","Distrust","Mistrust","Cohen’s Kappa","Kappa Coefficient","Scientific Information","Visualization Tool","Broad Themes","Broader Themes","Broad Topics","Professional Networks","Pie Chart","Subject Matter Experts","Single Code","Parametric Statistical Tests","Quantitative Work","Emergent Codes","Straw Man","Straw Men","Understanding Of Statistics","Expert Perspectives","Section Of The Interview","Visual Metaphors","Intuitive Design","Third Of Participants","Coding Process","Statistical Parameters","Sample Mean"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327178","title":"Radial Icicle Tree (RIT): Node Separation and Area Constancy","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":52,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Oxford, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37090080688","id":37090080688,"full_name":"Yuanzhe Jin","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Oxford, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Statistics Netherlands, the Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/140560718906863","id":140560718906863,"full_name":"Tim J.

While icicle trees can map data values faithfully to rectangles of different sizes, often some rectangles are too narrow to be noticed easily. When an icicle tree is transformed into a sunburst tree, the width of each rectangle becomes the length of an annular sector that is usually longer than the original width. While sunburst trees alleviate the problem of narrow rectangles in icicle trees, it no longer maintains the consistency of size encoding. At different tree depths, nodes of the same data values are displayed in annular sections of different sizes in a sunburst tree, though they are represented by rectangles of the same size in an icicle tree. Furthermore, two nodes from different subtrees could sometimes appear as a single node in both icicle trees and sunburst trees. In this paper, we propose a new visual representation, referred to as radial icicle tree (RIT), which transforms the rectangular bounding box of an icicle tree into a circle, circular sector, or annular sector while introducing gaps between nodes and maintaining area constancy for nodes of the same size. We applied the new visual design to several datasets. Both the analytical design process and user-centered evaluation have confirmed that this new design has improved the design of icicles and sunburst trees without introducing any relative demerit.","article_number":"10297579","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10297579","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10297579/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10297579/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"251","end_page":"261","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":121,"insert_date":"20231026","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Encoding","Graphics","Distortion","Image color analysis","Decoding"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Tree visualization","icicle tree","sunburst tree","size encoding","area constancy","node separation","radial icicle tree","RIT"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Design Process","Visual Representation","Subtree","Tree Depth","Visual Design","Circular Section","Tree Representation","Public Domain","Tree Structure","Root Node","Parent Node","Tree Nodes","Neighboring Nodes","Visualization Techniques","Child Nodes","Children Nodes","Number Of Empirical Studies","Treemap","Functional Tree","Performance Of Trees","Design Options","Sequence Of Transitions","Statistics Netherlands","Tree Plot","Trees In Each Plot","Wedge Angle","Mathematical Reasoning","Potential Distortion","Tree Visualization","Simple Tree","Visual Encoding","Nodes In Set","Invariant Representation","Domain Experts","Color Map"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326514","title":"PROWIS: A Visual Approach for Building, Managing, and Analyzing Weather Simulation Ensembles at Runtime","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":53,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Universidade Federal Fluminense and the University of Illinois, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/494347551817762","id":494347551817762,"full_name":"Carolina Veiga Ferreira de Souza","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universidade Federal Fluminense and the University of Illinois, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/107606684629619","id":107606684629619,"full_name":"Suzanna Maria Bonnet","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"]}},{"affiliation":"Universidade Federal Fluminense, Brazil","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087253045","id":37087253045,"full_name":"Daniel de Oliveira","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universidade Federal Fluminense, Brazil"]}},{"affiliation":"Universidade Federal Fluminense, Brazil","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/828709784048947","id":828709784048947,"full_name":"Marcio Cataldi","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universidade Federal Fluminense, Brazil"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Illinois Chicago, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085886059","id":37085886059,"full_name":"Fabio Miranda","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Illinois Chicago, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Universidade Federal Fluminense, Brazil","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37721747800","id":37721747800,"full_name":"Marcos Lage","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universidade Federal Fluminense, Brazil"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Weather forecasting is essential for decision-making and is usually performed using numerical modeling.

When the simulation is finished, the experts face challenges analyzing its outputs, a large mass of spatiotemporal and multivariate data. From the simulation setup to the analysis of results, working with weather simulations involves several manual and error-prone steps.

An essential phase in UXO detection is the task of image selection, where a small subset of images must be chosen from archives to reconstruct an area of interest (AOI) and identify craters. The selected image set must comply with good spatial and temporal coverage over the AOI, particularly in the temporal vicinity of recorded aerial attacks, and do so with minimal images for resource optimization. This paper presents a guidance-enhanced visual analytics prototype to select images for UXO detection. In close collaboration with domain experts, our design process involved analyzing user tasks, eliciting expert knowledge, modeling quality metrics, and choosing appropriate guidance. We report on a user study with two real-world scenarios of image selection performed with and without guidance. Our solution was well-received and deemed highly usable. Through the lens of our task-based design and developed quality measures, we observed guidance-driven changes in user behavior and improved quality of analysis results. An expert evaluation of the study allowed us to improve our guidance-enhanced prototype further and discuss new possibilities for user-adaptive guidance.","article_number":"10308619","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10308619","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10308619/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10308619/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"66","end_page":"75","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":536,"insert_date":"20231103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Task analysis","Decision making","Weapons","Optimization","Metadata","Image reconstruction","Prototypes"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Application Motivated Visualization","Geospatial Data","Mixed Initiative Human-Machine Analysis","Process/Workflow Design","Task Abstractions & Application Domains","Temporal Data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Time And Space","Spacetime","Selection Time","Prototype","Design Process","User Study","Aerial Images","Aerial Photographs","Aerial Photos","Aerial Imagery","Real-world Scenarios","Spatial Coverage","Domain Experts","Temporal Coverage","Subset Of Images","User Tasks","Knowledge Gaps","Set Of Equations","Equivalence Classes","Optimal Combination","Temporal Relationship","Direct Use","Direct Utilization","Direct Manipulation","Explanatory Model","Divide-and-conquer","Divide-and-rule","Visual Design","Effective Guidance","Steering Effect","Hundreds Of Images","Divide-and-conquer Approach","Divide And Conquer Algorithm","Divide-and-conquer Method","Partner Companies","Image Metadata","Agonistic Behavior","User Selection","Overview Images","Search Task"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326912","title":"Visual Analytics for Understanding Draco's Knowledge Base","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":55,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"VRVis Zentrum für Virtual Reality und visualisierung Forschungs-GmbH, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077239600","id":37077239600,"full_name":"Johanna Schmidt","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VRVis Zentrum für Virtual Reality und visualisierung Forschungs-GmbH, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"VRVis Zentrum für Virtual Reality und visualisierung Forschungs-GmbH, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/125406840080824","id":125406840080824,"full_name":"Bernhard Pointner","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VRVis Zentrum für Virtual Reality und visualisierung Forschungs-GmbH, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Centre for Visual Analytics Science and Technology (CVAST), TU Wien, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282584500","id":37282584500,"full_name":"Silvia Miksch","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Centre for Visual Analytics Science and Technology (CVAST), TU Wien, Austria"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Draco has been developed as an automated visualization recommendation system formalizing design knowledge as logical constraints in ASP (Answer-Set Programming). With an increasing set of constraints and incorporated design knowledge, even visualization experts lose overview in Draco and struggle to retrace the automated recommendation decisions made by the system. Our paper proposes an Visual Analytics (VA) approach to visualize and analyze Draco's constraints. Our VA approach is supposed to enable visualization experts to accomplish identified tasks regarding the knowledge base and support them in better understanding Draco. We extend the existing data extraction strategy of Draco with a data processing architecture capable of extracting features of interest from the knowledge base. A revised version of the ASP grammar provides the basis for this data processing strategy. The resulting incorporated and shared features of the constraints are then visualized using a hypergraph structure inside the radial-arranged constraints of the elaborated visualization. The hierarchical categories of the constraints are indicated by arcs surrounding the constraints. Our approach is supposed to enable visualization experts to interactively explore the design rules' violations based on highlighting respective constraints or recommendations. A qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the prototype confirms the prototype's effectiveness and value in acquiring insights into Draco's recommendation process and design constraints.","article_number":"10294308","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10294308","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10294308/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10294308/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"392","end_page":"402","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":185,"insert_date":"20231024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Aggregates","Task analysis","Recommender systems","Costs","Bars","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analytics","Hypergraph visualization","Rule-based recommendation systems"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Knowledge Base","Shared Features","Shared Characteristics","Recommender Systems","Hypergraph","Logical Constraints","Years Of Experience","Support Vector Machine","Hierarchical Structure","Hierarchical Organization","Data Visualization","Set Of Rules","Design Decisions","Visibility Graph","Node Features","Specific Constraints","Test Persons","Visual Approach","Hard Constraints","Visual Design","Soft Constraints","Program Logic","Proper Visualization","Visual Encoding","Heuristic Evaluation","Abstract Syntax Tree","Radial Arrangement","Radial Placement","Application Programming Interface","Programming Interface","Node Positions","Location Of Nodes","Text Labels","Design Guidelines"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326940","title":"SkiVis: Visual Exploration and Route Planning in Ski Resorts","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":56,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/644616478954833","id":644616478954833,"full_name":"Julius Rauscher","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086942285","id":37086942285,"full_name":"Raphael Buchmüller","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","id":37283138700,"full_name":"Daniel A.

Tailor-made visual analytics software is developed for each specific application, limiting their applicability in other fields. However, as diverse as these fields are, their characteristics and requirements for data analysis are conceptually similar. Many applications share abstract tasks and data types and are often constructed with similar building blocks. Developing such applications, even when based mostly on existing building blocks, requires significant engineering efforts. We developed ManiVault, a flexible and extensible open-source visual analytics framework for analyzing high-dimensional data. The primary objective of ManiVault is to facilitate rapid prototyping of visual analytics workflows for visualization software developers and practitioners alike. ManiVault is built using a plugin-based architecture that offers easy extensibility. While our architecture deliberately keeps plugins self-contained, to guarantee maximum flexibility and re-usability, we have designed and implemented a messaging API for tight integration and linking of modules to support common visual analytics design patterns. We provide several visualization and analytics plugins, and ManiVault's API makes the integration of new plugins easy for developers. ManiVault facilitates the distribution of visualization and analysis pipelines and results for practitioners through saving and reproducing complete application states. As such, ManiVault can be used as a communication tool among researchers to discuss workflows and results.

Neuroscientists are analyzing these networks to better understand information processing in the brain. In particular, scientists are interested in identifying specific small network motifs, i.e., repeating subgraphs of the larger brain network that are believed to be neuronal building blocks. Although such motifs are typically small (e.g., 2–6 neurons), the vast data sizes and intricate data complexity present significant challenges to the search and analysis process. To analyze these motifs, it is crucial to review instances of a motif in the brain network and then map the graph structure to detailed 3D reconstructions of the involved neurons and synapses. We present Vimo, an interactive visual approach to analyze neuronal motifs and motif chains in large brain networks. Experts can sketch network motifs intuitively in a visual interface and specify structural properties of the involved neurons and synapses to query large connectomics datasets. Motif instances (MIs) can be explored in high-resolution 3D renderings. To simplify the analysis of MIs, we designed a continuous focus&context metaphor inspired by visual abstractions. This allows users to transition from a highly-detailed rendering of the anatomical structure to views that emphasize the underlying motif structure and synaptic connectivity. Furthermore, Vimo supports the identification of motif chains where a motif is used repeatedly (e.g., 2–4 times) to form a larger network structure. We evaluate Vimo in a user study and an in-depth case study with seven domain experts on motifs in a large connectome of the fruit fly, including more than 21,000 neurons and 20 million synapses. We find that Vimo enables hypothesis generation and confirmation through fast analysis iterations and connectivity highlighting.","article_number":"10298029","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10298029","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10298029/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10298029/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"748","end_page":"758","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":254,"insert_date":"20231026","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Neurons","Visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Synapses","Morphology","Brain","Rendering (computer graphics)"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual motif analysis","Focus&Context","Scientific visualization","Neuroscience","Connectomics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Motif Analysis","Neuronal Connectivity","Connectivity Motifs","Neuroscience","Neurobiological","Neural Circuits","Neuronal Circuits","Brain Circuits","Neuronal Networks","Brain Networks","User Study","Domain Experts","Specific Motifs","Connectome","Image Synthesis","Rendering Engine","3D Renderings","Visual Approach","In-depth Case Studies","Visual Interface","Network Motifs","Small Motifs","Motif Instances","Brain Regions","Exploratory Analysis","Exploratory Data Analysis","Thousands Of Neurons","Large Graphs","Types Of Neurons","Neuronal Morphology","Biological Constraints","Synaptic Pruning","Dendrite Pruning","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","3D Skeleton","Graph Database","Neuronal Branching"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327189","title":"Mosaic: An Architecture for Scalable & Interoperable Data Views","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":61,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Washington, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550791300","id":37550791300,"full_name":"Jeffrey Heer","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Washington, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Carnegie Mellon University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085711170","id":37085711170,"full_name":"Dominik Moritz","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Mosaic is an architecture for greater scalability, extensibility, and interoperability of interactive data views. Mosaic decouples data processing from specification logic: clients publish their data needs as declarative queries that are then managed and automatically optimized by a coordinator that proxies access to a scalable data store. Mosaic generalizes Vegalite's selection abstraction to enable rich integration and linking across visualizations and components such as menus, text search, and tables. We demonstrate Mosaic's expressiveness, extensibility, and interoperability through examples that compose diverse visualization, interaction, and optimization techniques—many constructed using vgplot, a grammar of interactive graphics in which graphical marks act as Mosaic clients. To evaluate scalability, we present benchmark studies with order-of-magnitude performance improvements over existing web-based visualization systems—enabling flexible, real-time visual exploration of billion+ record datasets. We conclude by discussing Mosaic's potential as an open platform that bridges visualization languages, scalable visualization, and interactive data systems more broadly.","article_number":"10297587","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10297587","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10297587/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10297587/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"436","end_page":"446","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":239,"insert_date":"20231026","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Computer architecture","Soft sensors","Scalability","Databases","Optimization","Grammar"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Interaction","Scalability","Grammar of Graphics","Software Architecture","Databases"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Scalable","Interoperability","Record Dataset","Automatic Optimization","Dataset Size","Local Services","Location-based Services","Visualization Tool","Density Plots","Interactive Visualization","Caching","Aggregation Function","Jupyter Notebook","Data Cube","Input Components","Graph Layout","Graph Drawing","Structured Query Language","Flight Data","Client Data","2D Histogram","Visual Encoding","Subsequent Updates","Input Events","Geometric Primitives","Graphical Primitives","Density Contour","JavaScript","Remote Server","Individual Clients"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326596","title":"Guaranteed Visibility in Scatterplots with Tolerance","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":62,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Univ.

Such a guarantee is barely respected in complex visualizations, mainly because of overdraws between datum representations that hide parts of the information (e.g., outliers). The literature proposes various Layout Adjustment algorithms to improve the readability of visualizations that suffer from this issue. Manipulating the data in high-dimensional, geometric or visual space; they rely on different strategies with their own strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, most of these algorithms are computationally expensive as they search for an exact solution in the geometric space and do not scale well to large datasets. This article proposes GIST, a layout adjustment algorithm that aims at optimizing three criteria: (i) node visibility guarantee (at least 1 pixel), (ii) node size maximization, and (iii) the original layout preservation. This is achieved by combining a search for the maximum node size that enables to draw all the data points without overlaps, with a limited budget of movements (i.e., limiting the distortions of the original layout). The method's basis relies on the idea that it is not necessary for two data representations to be strictly not overlapping in order to guarantee their visibility in visual space. Our algorithm therefore uses a tolerance in the geometric space to determine the overlaps between pairs of data. The tolerance is optimized such that the approximation computed in the geometric space can lead to visualization without noticeable overdraw after the data rendering rasterization. In addition, such an approximation helps to ease the algorithm's convergence as it reduces the number of constraints to resolve, enabling it to handle large datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing its results to those of state-of-the-art methods on several large datasets.","article_number":"10292566","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10292566","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292566/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292566/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"792","end_page":"802","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":169,"insert_date":"20231023","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Layout","Data visualization","Visualization","Approximation algorithms","Task analysis","Dispersion","Stress"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Guaranteed visibility","Layout adjustment","Overlap removal","Scatterplots"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["High-dimensional","High-dimensional Space","Geometric Properties","Geometric Dimensions","Node Size","Convergence Of Algorithm","Computational Expense","Expensive Calculations","Visual Space","Center Of Mass","Center Of Gravity","Density Distribution","Dense Regions","Stochastic Gradient Descent","SGD Optimizer","Bounding Box","Pair Of Nodes","Case Of Problem","Binary Search","Global Shape","Node Representations","Identification Of Outliers","Target Resolution","Graph Layout","Graph Drawing","Visual Encoding","Node Diameter","Diameter Of Lymph Nodes","Ideal Distance","Optimal Node"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327402","title":"2D, 2.5D, or 3D?

Therefore, we studied this impact for several commonly occurring tasks related to MLN analysis.

We ran a human subject study utilising a Virtual Reality headset to evaluate 2D, 2.5D, and 3D layer arrangements. The study employs six analysis tasks that cover the spectrum of an MLN task taxonomy, from path finding and pattern identification to comparisons between and across layers.

For example, the rise of shot maps has changed basketball strategy by visually illustrating where “good/bad” shots are taken from. As a result, professional basketball teams today take shots from very different positions on the court than they did 20 years ago. Although the shot map has transformed many facets of the game, there is still much room for improvement to support richer and more complex analytical tasks. More specifically, we believe that the lack of sufficient interactivity to support various analytical queries and the inability to visually compare differences across situations are significant limitations of current shot maps. To address these limitations and showcase new possibilities, we designed and developed HoopInSight, an interactive visualization system that centers around a novel spatial comparison visual technique, enhancing the capabilities of shot maps in basketball analytics. This article presents the system, with a focus on our proposed visual technique and its accompanying interactions, all designed to promote comparison of two different scenarios. Furthermore, we provide reflections on and a discussion of relevant issues, including considerations for designing spatial comparison techniques, the scalability and transferability of this approach, and the benefits and pitfalls of designing as domain experts.","article_number":"10292892","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10292892","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292892/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292892/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"858","end_page":"868","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":339,"insert_date":"20231023","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Sports","Visualization","Games","Fans","Task analysis","Stakeholders"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["sports data visualization","sports analytics","visual comparison","basketball"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Shooting Performance","Domain Experts","Visualization Techniques","Interactive Visualization","Spatial Comparison","Changes In Frequency","Aggregate Level","Visual Comparison","Vision Research","Changes In Efficiency","Spatial Filter","Level Of Granularity","Blue Triangles","Green Triangles","Player Performance","Treemap","Functional Tree","Performance Of Trees","Visual Design","Current Season","Interaction Techniques","Sports Journalism","Sports News","Sports Media","Comparison Of Scenarios","Visual Encoding","Team Strategy","Different Levels Of Granularity","Style Of Play","Choropleth Maps","Basketball Court","Limited Area","Restricted Area","Design Expert","Multiple Datasets"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326576","title":"Reclaiming the Horizon: Novel Visualization Designs for Time-Series Data with Large Value Ranges","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":65,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Cologne, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089635101","id":37089635101,"full_name":"Daniel Braun","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Cologne, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"King's College London, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591074800","id":37591074800,"full_name":"Rita Borgo","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["King's College London, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Cologne, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086219178","id":37086219178,"full_name":"Max Sondag","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Cologne, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Cologne, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586276100","id":37586276100,"full_name":"Tatiana von Landesberger","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Cologne, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We introduce two novel visualization designs to support practitioners in performing identification and discrimination tasks on large value ranges (i.e., several orders of magnitude) in time-series data: (1) The order of magnitude horizon graph, which extends the classic horizon graph; and (2) the order of magnitude line chart, which adapts the log-line chart.

When reporting on U.S. attitudes toward public policies, it is popular to highlight the gap between Democrats and Republicans (e.g. with blue vs red connected dot plots). But these charts may encourage social-normative conformity, influencing viewers' attitudes to match the divided opinions shown in the visualization. We conducted three experiments examining visualization framing in the context of social conformity and polarization. Crowdworkers viewed charts showing simulated polling results for public policy proposals. We varied framing (aggregating data as non-partisan “All US Adults,” or partisan “Democrat” / “Republican”) and the visualized groups' support levels. Participants then reported their own support for each policy. We found that participants' attitudes biased significantly toward the group attitudes shown in the stimuli and this can increase inter-party attitude divergence. These results demonstrate that data visualizations can induce social conformity and accelerate political polarization.

This paper describes the ExTreeM-Algorithm: A scalable algorithm for the computation of merge trees via extremum graphs. The core idea of ExTreeM is to first derive the extremum graph $\\mathcal{G}$ of an input scalar field $f$ defined on a cell complex $\\mathcal{K}$, and subsequently compute the unaugmented merge tree of $f$ on $\\mathcal{G}$ instead of $\\mathcal{K}$; which are equivalent. Any merge tree algorithm can be carried out significantly faster on $\\mathcal{G}$, since $\\mathcal{K}$ in general contains substantially more cells than $\\mathcal{G}$. To further speed up computation, ExTreeM includes a tailored procedure to derive merge trees of extremum graphs.

Compression techniques have been employed to tackle this challenge, but traditional lossy methods often demand conservative error tolerances to meet the numerical accuracy requirements of both anticipated and unknown data analysis tasks. Progressive data compression and retrieval has emerged as a promising solution, where each analysis task dictates its own accuracy needs. However, few analysis algorithms inherently support progressive data processing, and adapting compression techniques, file formats, client/server frameworks, and APIs to support progressivity can be challenging. This paper presents a framework that enables progressive-precision data queries for any data compressor or numerical representation. Our strategy hinges on a multi-component representation that successively reduces the error between the original and compressed field, allowing each field in the progressive sequence to be expressed as a partial sum of components. We have implemented this approach with four established scientific data compressors and assessed its effectiveness using real-world data sets from the SDRBench collection. The results show that our framework competes in accuracy with the standalone compressors it is based upon. Additionally, (de)compression time is proportional to the number of components requested by the user. Finally, our framework allows for fully lossless compression using lossy compressors when a sufficient number of components are employed.","article_number":"10308629","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10308629","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10308629/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10308629/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"1358","end_page":"1368","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":224,"insert_date":"20231103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image coding","Costs","Task analysis","Image resolution","Image reconstruction","Encoding","Data analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Lossy to lossless compression","progressive precision","multi-component expansion","floating-point data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Source Code","Data Compression","Progressive Compression","File Format","Analysis Tasks","Error Tolerance","Sum Of Components","Time Compression","Scientific Observations","Lossless Compression","Lossless Data Compression","Cylindrical","Cylinder","Wavelet","Second Derivative","Second-order Derivatives","Bitplane","Bitrate","Bitstream","Binary Sequence","Storage Cost","Error Bounds","Compression Ratio","Spatial Derivatives","Uncompressed","Lossy Compression","Reconstruction Time","Subset Of Components","Coding Tree","Huffman Coding","Compression Parameters","Gain In Accuracy","Multicomponent Approach","Memory Hierarchy","Single Precision","Numerical Data"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326515","title":"A Parallel Framework for Streaming Dimensionality Reduction","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":69,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37531405500","id":37531405500,"full_name":"Jiazhi Xia","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641249","id":37089641249,"full_name":"Linquan Huang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37090005774","id":37090005774,"full_name":"Yiping Sun","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089515197","id":37089515197,"full_name":"Zhiwei Deng","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Pennsylvania State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547462","id":37086547462,"full_name":"Xiaolong Luke Zhang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086420980","id":37086420980,"full_name":"Minfeng Zhu","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhejiang University, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The visualization of streaming high-dimensional data often needs to consider the speed in dimensionality reduction algorithms, the quality of visualized data patterns, and the stability of view graphs that usually change over time with new data.

In this research, we propose a novel parallel framework for streaming high-dimensional data visualization to achieve high data processing speed, high quality in data patterns, and good stability in visual presentations. This framework arranges all essential modules in parallel to mitigate the delays caused by module waiting in serial setups.

Our method employs color not only to visually communicate data density but also to highlight similar regions in the plot, allowing users to identify and distinguish trends easily. We achieve this by performing hierarchical clustering based on the lines passing through each region and mapping the identified clusters to the hue circle using circular MDS. Additionally, we propose a heuristic approach to assign each line to the most probable cluster, enabling users to analyze density and individual lines. We motivate our method by conducting a small-scale user study, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method using synthetic and real-world datasets, and providing an interactive online tool for generating colored line-based density plots.","article_number":"10297597","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10297597","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10297597/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10297597/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"825","end_page":"835","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":320,"insert_date":"20231026","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Image color analysis","Market research","Trajectory","Clutter"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Trajectory data","times series","density-based visualization","clustering","coloring"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Density Plots","Interactive","Hierarchical Clustering","Hierarchical Cluster Analysis","User Study","Real-world Datasets","Image Space","Complex Datasets","Regional Plots","Line Chart","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Trends In Datasets","Time Series","Scatter Plot","Time Series Data","Patterns In Data","Dense Regions","Trends Data","Color Map","Line Plots","Dice Similarity Coefficient","Dice Coefficient","Trend Plots","Line Bundle","Dynamic Time Warping","Parallel Coordinates","Main Trends","Overlap Coefficient","Hue Values","Types Of Ambiguity","Ambiguous Type","Clustering Of Lines","Portion Of Participants"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326595","title":"Dr. KID: Direct Remeshing and K-Set Isometric Decomposition for Scalable Physicalization of Organic Shapes","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":72,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Visual Computing Center, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085350366","id":37085350366,"full_name":"Dawar Khan","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Computing Center, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia"]}},{"affiliation":"Visual Computing Center, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086130068","id":37086130068,"full_name":"Ciril Bohak","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Computing Center, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia"]}},{"affiliation":"Visual Computing Center, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282726800","id":37282726800,"full_name":"Ivan Viola","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Computing Center, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia"]}}]},"access_type":"CCBY - IEEE is not the copyright holder of this material.

The algorithm begins with creating a simple, regular triangular surface mesh of organic shapes, followed by iterative K-means clustering and remeshing. For clustering, we need similarity between triangles (segments) which is defined as a distance function. The distance function maps each triangle's shape to a single point in the virtual 3D space. Thus, the distance between the triangles indicates their degree of dissimilarity. K-means clustering uses this distance and sorts segments into $k$ classes. After this, remeshing is applied to minimize the distance between triangles within the same cluster by making their shapes identical. Clustering and remeshing are repeated until the distance between triangles in the same cluster reaches an acceptable threshold. We adopt a curvature-aware strategy to determine the surface thickness and finalize puzzle pieces for 3D printing. Identical hinges and holes are created for assembling the puzzle components. For smoother outcomes, we use triangle subdivision along with curvature-aware clustering, generating curved triangular patches for 3D printing. Our algorithm was evaluated using various models, and the 3D-printed results were analyzed. Findings indicate that our algorithm performs reliably on target organic shapes with minimal loss of input geometry.","article_number":"10290929","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10290929","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10290929/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10290929/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"705","end_page":"715","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":225,"insert_date":"20231023","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three-dimensional displays","Solid modeling","Shape","Biology","Biological system modeling","Biomembranes","Surface treatment"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Physicalization","Physical visualization","3D printing","Isometric decomposition","Direct remeshing","Biological structures","Intracellular compartments"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Organ Shape","Physicalism","K-means","K-means Clustering","3D Printing","3D Space","3-dimensional Space","3D Mesh","Surface Mesh","Degree Of Dissimilarity","Outer Layer","Outer Surface","Inner Layer","Energy Function","Global Optimization","Structural Biology","Convergence Of Algorithm","Mesh Generation","Grid Generation","Voronoi Diagram","Voronoi Tessellation","Voronoi Cell","Squared Euclidean Distance","Error Threshold","Injection Molding","Clustered Errors","Hinge Joint","Geometric Loss","Center Of The Triangle","Vertex Position","Positions Of Vertices","Part Of The Puzzle"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327201","title":"CLAMS: A Cluster Ambiguity Measure for Estimating Perceptual Variability in Visual Clustering","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":73,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Seoul National University, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656795","id":37088656795,"full_name":"Hyeon Jeon","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Seoul National University, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086556695","id":37086556695,"full_name":"Ghulam Jilani Quadri","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"UNIST, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088891513","id":37088891513,"full_name":"Hyunwook Lee","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UNIST, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Utah, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37398611400","id":37398611400,"full_name":"Paul Rosen","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Utah, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Seoul National University, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085770068","id":37085770068,"full_name":"Danielle Albers Szafir","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Seoul National University, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Seoul National University, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37422552700","id":37422552700,"full_name":"Jinwook Seo","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Seoul National University, South Korea"]}}]},"access_type":"OPEN_ACCESS","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Visual clustering is a common perceptual task in scatterplots that supports diverse analytics tasks (e.g., cluster identification). However, even with the same scatterplot, the ways of perceiving clusters (i.e., conducting visual clustering) can differ due to the differences among individuals and ambiguous cluster boundaries. Although such perceptual variability casts doubt on the reliability of data analysis based on visual clustering, we lack a systematic way to efficiently assess this variability. In this research, we study perceptual variability in conducting visual clustering, which we call Cluster Ambiguity. To this end, we introduce CLAMS, a data-driven visual quality measure for automatically predicting cluster ambiguity in monochrome scatterplots. We first conduct a qualitative study to identify key factors that affect the visual separation of clusters (e.g., proximity or size difference between clusters). Based on study findings, we deploy a regression module that estimates the human-judged separability of two clusters. Then, CLAMS predicts cluster ambiguity by analyzing the aggregated results of all pairwise separability between clusters that are generated by the module. CLAMS outperforms widely-used clustering techniques in predicting ground truth cluster ambiguity. Meanwhile, CLAMS exhibits performance on par with human annotators. We conclude our work by presenting two applications for optimizing and benchmarking data mining techniques using CLAMS.

These types of analyses focus on answering why questions about underlying spatial phenomena, e.g., why is crime higher in this locale, why do children in one school district outperform those in another, etc.? Answers to these questions require explanations of the model structure, the choice of parameters, and contextualization of the findings with respect to their geographic context. This is particularly true for local forms of regression models which are focused on the role of locational context in determining human behavior. In this paper, we present GeoExplainer, a visual analytics framework designed to support analysts in creating explanative documentation that summarizes and contextualizes their spatial analyses. As analysts create their spatial models, our framework flags potential issues with model parameter selections, utilizes template-based text generation to summarize model outputs, and links with external knowledge repositories to provide annotations that help to explain the model results. As analysts explore the model results, all visualizations and annotations can be captured in an interactive report generation widget. We demonstrate our framework using a case study modeling the determinants of voting in the 2016 US Presidential Election.","article_number":"10297564","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10297564","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10297564/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10297564/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"1391","end_page":"1401","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":285,"insert_date":"20231026","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Analytical models","Annotations","Data visualization","Context modeling","Data models","Pipelines","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Spatial data analysis","local models","multiscale geographically weighted regression","model explanation","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Spatial Model","Visual Analytics Framework","Interactive","Model Parameters","External Knowledge","US Presidential Election","United States Presidential Election","Text Generation","Sentence Generation","Natural Language Generation","Visual Framework","Spatial Phenomena","Spatial Phenomenon","Dependent Variable","Spatial Patterns","Spatiotemporal Patterns","Temporal Patterns","Model Validation","Contextual Information","Spatial Clustering","Domain Experts","Model Configuration","External Information","Color Scheme","Local Coefficient","Geographic Analysis","Geographically Weighted Regression","Choropleth Maps","Narrative Explanation","Map View","Pipeline Stages","Automatic Generation","Text Annotation","Cook’s Distance","Cook’s D","Numerical Distribution","Visual Design"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326593","title":"From Information to Choice: A Critical Inquiry Into Visualization Tools for Decision Making","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":75,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Utrecht University, Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/494491129075874","id":494491129075874,"full_name":"Emre Oral","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Utrecht University, Netherlands"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Massachusetts Amherst, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089849461","id":37089849461,"full_name":"Ria Chawla","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Massachusetts Amherst, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Utrecht University, Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/533227681162611","id":533227681162611,"full_name":"Michel Wijkstra","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Utrecht University, Netherlands"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Massachusetts Amherst, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591344800","id":37591344800,"full_name":"Narges Mahyar","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Massachusetts Amherst, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Utrecht University, Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085898406","id":37085898406,"full_name":"Evanthia Dimara","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Utrecht University, Netherlands"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In the face of complex decisions, people often engage in a three-stage process that spans from (1) exploring and analyzing pertinent information (intelligence); (2) generating and exploring alternative options (design); and ultimately culminating in (3) selecting the optimal decision by evaluating discerning criteria (choice). We can fairly assume that all good visualizations aid in the “intelligence” stage by enabling data exploration and analysis. Yet, to what degree and how do visualization systems currently support the other decision making stages, namely “design” and “choice”? To further explore this question, we conducted a comprehensive review of decision-focused visualization tools by examining publications in major visualization journals and conferences, including VIS, EuroVis, and CHI, spanning all available years. We employed a deductive coding method and in-depth analysis to assess whether and how visualization tools support design and choice. Specifically, we examined each visualization tool by (i) its degree of visibility for displaying decision alternatives, criteria, and preferences, and (ii) its degree of flexibility for offering means to manipulate the decision alternatives, criteria, and preferences with interactions such as adding, modifying, changing mapping, and filtering. Our review highlights the opportunities and challenges that decision-focused visualization tools face in realizing their full potential to support all stages of the decision making process. It reveals a surprising scarcity of tools that support all stages, and while most tools excel in offering visibility for decision criteria and alternatives, the degree of flexibility to manipulate these elements is often limited, and the lack of tools that accommodate decision preferences and their elicitation is notable. Based on our findings, to better support the choice stage, future research could explore enhancing flexibility levels and variety, exploring novel visualization paradigms, increasing algorithmic support, and ensuring that this automation is user-controlled via the enhanced flexibility I evels.

Despite their popularity, little is known about their impact on enticing readers to explore visualisations. To address this gap, we conducted 18 interviews with a diverse group of participants who were consumers of news media but non-experts in visualisation and design. Participants were shown ten embellished and plain visualisations collected from the news and asked to rank them based on enticement and ease of understanding. Extending prior work, our interview results suggest that visualisations with multiple embellishment types might make a visualisation perceived as more enticing. An important finding from our study is that the widespread of certain embellishments in the media might have made them part of visualisation conventions, making a visualisation appear more objective but less enticing. Based on these findings, we ran a follow-up online user study showing participants variations of the visualisations with multiple embellishments to isolate each embellishment type and investigate its effect. We found that variations with salient embellishments were perceived as more enticing. We argue that to unpack the concept of embellishments; we must consider two factors: embellishment saliency and editorial styles.

This intention can be of many forms such as to persuade, to educate, to inform, or even to entertain. In addition to expressing their intention, the story plot must balance being consumable and enjoyable while preserving scientific integrity. In data stories, numerous methods have been identified for constructing and presenting a plot. However, there is an opportunity to expand how we think and create the visual elements that present the story. Stories are brought to life by characters; often they are what make a story captivating, enjoyable, memorable, and facilitate following the plot until the end. Through the analysis of 160 existing data stories, we systematically investigate and identify distinguishable features of characters in data stories, and we illustrate how they feed into the broader concept of “character-oriented design”. We identify the roles and visual representations data characters assume as well as the types of relationships these roles have with one another. We identify characteristics of antagonists as well as define conflict in data stories. We find the need for an identifiable central character that the audience latches on to in order to follow the narrative and identify their visual representations. We then illustrate “character-oriented design” by showing how to develop data characters with common data story plots. With this work, we present a framework for data characters derived from our analysis; we then offer our extension to the data storytelling process using character-oriented design.

Previous research focused on characterizing the theoretical aspects of guidance in visual analytics and implementing guidance in different scenarios. However, the evaluation of guidance-enhanced visual analytics solutions remains an open research question. We tackle this question by introducing and validating a practical evaluation methodology for guidance in visual analytics. We identify eight quality criteria to be fulfilled and collect expert feedback on their validity. To facilitate actual evaluation studies, we derive two sets of heuristics. The first set targets heuristic evaluations conducted by expert evaluators. The second set facilitates end-user studies where participants actually use a guidance-enhanced system. By following such a dual approach, the different quality criteria of guidance can be examined from two different perspectives, enhancing the overall value of evaluation studies. To test the practical utility of our methodology, we employ it in two studies to gain insight into the quality of two guidance-enhanced visual analytics solutions, one being a work-in-progress research prototype, and the other being a publicly available visualization recommender system. Based on these two evaluations, we derive good practices for conducting evaluations of guidance in visual analytics and identify pitfalls to be avoided during such

skill. Online speakers are facing unique challenges in engaging with remote audiences. However, there has been a lack of evidence-based analytical systems for people to comprehensively evaluate online speeches and further discover possibilities for improvement. This paper introduces SpeechMirror, a visual analytics system facilitating reflection on a speech based on insights from a collection of online speeches. The system estimates the impact of different speech techniques on effectiveness and applies them to a speech to give users awareness of the performance of speech techniques. A similarity recommendation approach based on speech factors or script content supports guided exploration to expand knowledge of presentation evidence and accelerate the discovery of speech delivery possibilities. SpeechMirror provides intuitive visualizations and interactions for users to understand speech factors. Among them, SpeechTwin, a novel multimodal visual summary of speech, supports rapid understanding of critical speech factors and comparison of different speech samples, and SpeechPlayer augments the speech video by integrating visualization of the speaker's body language with interaction, for focused analysis. The system utilizes visualizations suited to the distinct nature of different speech factors for user comprehension. The proposed system and visualization techniques were evaluated with domain experts and amateurs, demonstrating usability for users with low visualization literacy and its efficacy in assisting users to develop insights for potential improvement.","article_number":"10292871","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10292871","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292871/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292871/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"606","end_page":"616","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":277,"insert_date":"20231023","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Speech","Public speaking","Visual analytics","Interviews","Data visualization","Speech enhancement","Reflection"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analytics","Multimodal Analysis","Public Speaking","Online Presentation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual System","Public Speaking","Oral Presentations","Public Speech","Guest Speakers","Visual Analytics System","Domain Experts","Body Language","Speech Samples","Recommendation Approach","Effects Of Factors","Use Of Techniques","Facial Expressions","Bounding Box","Eye Contact","Eye Gaze","Visual Methods","Video Frames","Part-of-speech","Word Class","Word Category","Level Of Granularity","Gaze Direction","Time Slice","Multimodal Features","Original Video","Eye Gaze Direction","Body Gestures","Stages Of Use","Technical Understanding","Effect Of Different Techniques","Video Collection","Speech Data","Individual Sentences","Use Of Factors","Stage Movement"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327367","title":"Dead or Alive: Continuous Data Profiling for Interactive Data Science","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":81,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Carnegie Mellon University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087499812","id":37087499812,"full_name":"Will Epperson","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Carnegie Mellon University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/369202893355778","id":369202893355778,"full_name":"Vaishnavi Gorantla","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Carnegie Mellon University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085711170","id":37085711170,"full_name":"Dominik Moritz","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Carnegie Mellon University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294938400","id":37294938400,"full_name":"Adam Perer","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"OPEN_ACCESS","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Profiling data by plotting distributions and analyzing summary statistics is a critical step throughout data analysis. Currently, this process is manual and tedious since analysts must write extra code to examine their data after every transformation. This inefficiency may lead to data scientists profiling their data infrequently, rather than after each transformation, making it easy for them to miss important errors or insights. We propose continuous data profiling as a process that allows analysts to immediately see interactive visual summaries of their data throughout their data analysis to facilitate fast and thorough analysis. Our system, AutoProfiler, presents three ways to support continuous data profiling: (1) it automatically displays data distributions and summary statistics to facilitate data comprehension; (2) it is live, so visualizations are always accessible and update automatically as the data updates; (3) it supports follow up analysis and documentation by authoring code for the user in the notebook. In a user study with 16 participants, we evaluate two versions of our system that integrate different levels of automation: both automatically show data profiles and facilitate code authoring, however, one version updates reactively (“live”) and the other updates only on demand (“dead”). We find that both tools, dead or alive, facilitate insight discovery with 91% of user-generated insights originating from the tools rather than manual profiling code written by users. Participants found live updates intuitive and felt it helped them verify their transformations while those with on-demand profiles liked the ability to look at past visualizations. We also present a longitudinal case study on how AutoProfiler helped domain scientists find serendipitous insights about their data through automatic, live data profiles. Our results have implications for the design of future tools that offer automated data analysis support.","article_number":"10301695","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10301695","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10301695/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10301695/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"197","end_page":"207","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":607,"insert_date":"20231030","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Codes","Data visualization","Data models","Visualization","Programming","Manuals","Data science"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data Profiling","Data Quality","Exploratory Data Analysis","Interactive Data Science"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["User Study","Updated Data","Level Of Automation","Longitudinal Case Study","Data Quality","Health-related Quality Of Life","Livelihoods","Exploratory Analysis","Exploratory Data Analysis","Count Data","Count Values","Automatic System","Follow-up Analyses","Tool Version","Programming Environment","Analysis Code","Distribution Information","Open-source Tool","Summary Information","Profile Information","Jupyter Notebook","Column Type","Serendipitous Discovery","Serendipitous Finding","Hands Off","Errors In Dataset","Alert Fatigue","Alarm Fatigue","Memory Updating","Duplicate Values","Automatic Coding"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327165","title":"Adaptive Assessment of Visualization Literacy","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":82,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Northwestern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/828958968117581","id":828958968117581,"full_name":"Yuan Cui","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/772866112059648","id":772866112059648,"full_name":"Lily W.

Consequently, it is vital to understand the evolution of this ability and devise targeted interventions to enhance it, requiring concise and repeatable assessments of visualization literacy for individuals. However, current assessments, such as the Visualization Literacy Assessment Test (vlat), are time-consuming due to their fixed, lengthy format. To address this limitation, we develop two streamlined computerized adaptive tests (cats) for visualization literacy, a-vlat and a-calvi, which measure the same set of skills as their original versions in half the number of questions. Specifically, we (1) employ item response theory (IRT) and non-psychometric constraints to construct adaptive versions of the assessments, (2) finalize the configurations of adaptation through simulation, (3) refine the composition of test items of a-calvi via a qualitative study, and (4) demonstrate the test-retest reliability (ICC: 0.98 and 0.98) and convergent validity (correlation: 0.81 and 0.66) of both CATS via four online studies. We discuss practical recommendations for using our CATS and opportunities for further customization to leverage the full potential of adaptive assessments.

Octree approaches work by performing hierarchical tree traversal. However, in octree volume rendering, tree traversal and the selection of data resolution are intrinsically coupled. This makes fine-grained empty-space skipping costly. Page tables, on the other hand, allow access to any cached brick from any resolution. However, they do not offer a clear and efficient strategy for substituting missing high-resolution data with lower-resolution data. We enable flexible mixed-resolution out-of-core multi-volume rendering by decoupling the cache residency of multi-resolution data from a resolution-independent spatial subdivision determined by the tree. Instead of one-to-one node-to-brick correspondences, each residency octree node is mapped to a set of bricks from different resolution levels. This makes it possible to efficiently and adaptively choose and mix resolutions, adapt sampling rates, and compensate for cache misses. At the same time, residency octrees support fine-grained empty-space skipping, independent of the data subdivision used for caching. Finally, to facilitate collaboration and outreach, and to eliminate local data storage, our implementation is a web-based, pure client-side renderer using WebGPU and WebAssembly. Our method is faster than prior approaches and efficient for many data channels with a flexible and adaptive choice of data resolution.","article_number":"10299573","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10299573","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10299573/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10299573/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"1380","end_page":"1390","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":228,"insert_date":"20231027","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Octrees","Spatial resolution","Graphics processing units","Data visualization","Optimization","Standards"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Volume rendering","ray-guided rendering","large-scale data","out-of-core rendering","multi-resolution","multi-channel","web-based visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Level Of Resolution","Caching","Spatial Partitioning","Partition Of Space","Volume Rendering","Volumetric Rendering","Cache Misses","Data Structure","Volume Of Data","Intensity Data","Metadata","Voxel Size","Transfer Function","Large-scale Data","Regional Values","Large-scale Datasets","Spatial Extent","Work Settings","Multiple Channels","Regional Volume","Leaf Node","Subtree","Masked Images","Masking Signal","Masked Region","Part Of The Map","Voxel Data","Data For Each Voxel","Open Dataset","Open Data Sets","Data Nodes","Storage Nodes","Root Node","Parent Node","Low Resolution","Resolution In Order","Tree Structure","Single Channel"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326577","title":"OW-Adapter: Human-Assisted Open-World Object Detection with a Few Examples","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":84,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Bosch Research North America, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085681542","id":37085681542,"full_name":"Suphanut Jamonnak","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Bosch Research North America, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Bosch Research North America, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089003610","id":37089003610,"full_name":"Jiajing Guo","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Bosch Research North America, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Bosch Research North America, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085433063","id":37085433063,"full_name":"Wenbin He","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Bosch Research North America, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Bosch Research North America, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37075500200","id":37075500200,"full_name":"Liang Gou","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Bosch Research North America, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Bosch Research North America, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086048784","id":37086048784,"full_name":"Liu Ren","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Bosch Research North America, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Open-world object detection (OWOD) is an emerging computer vision problem that involves not only the identification of predefined object classes, like what general object detectors do, but also detects new unknown objects simultaneously. Recently, several end-to-end deep learning models have been proposed to address the OWOD problem. However, these approaches face several challenges: a) significant changes in both network architecture and training procedure are required; b) they are trained from scratch, which can not leverage existing pre-trained general detectors; c) costly annotations for all unknown classes are needed. To overcome these challenges, we present a visual analytic framework called OW-Adapter. It acts as an adaptor to enable pre-trained general object detectors to handle the OWOD problem. Specifically, OW-Adapter is designed to identify, summarize, and annotate unknown examples with minimal human effort. Moreover, we introduce a lightweight classifier to learn newly annotated unknown classes and plug the classifier into pre-trained general detectors to detect unknown objects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through two case studies of different domains, including common object recognition and autonomous driving. The studies show that a simple yet powerful adaptor can extend the capability of pre-trained general detectors to detect unknown objects and improve the performance on known classes simultaneously.","article_number":"10290904","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10290904","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10290904/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10290904/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"694","end_page":"704","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":415,"insert_date":"20231023","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Detectors","Automobiles","Proposals","Object detection","Object recognition","Visual analytics","Training"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Open world learning","object detection","continuous learning","human-assisted AI"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Object Detection","Visual Analysis","Object Classification","Common Objects","General Detection","Unknown Objects","Machine Learning","Model Performance","False Positive Rate","Visual System","Multilayer Perceptron","Bounding Box","Classifier Training","Incremental Learning","Continuous Learning","Objective Scores","Region Proposal Network","Giraffe","Giraffa Camelopardalis","Potential Objects","Number Of Proposals","Annotated Examples","Projection Views","Ground-truth Box","Maximum Confidence","Unknown Group","Visual Analytics Tool","Novelty Detection","2D Space","Anomaly Detection","IoU Threshold"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326592","title":"A Comparative Study of the Perceptual Sensitivity of Topological Visualizations to Feature Variations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":85,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077916100","id":37077916100,"full_name":"Tushar M.

Color maps, however, do not explicitly convey structures (e.g., positions and scale of features) within data. Topology-based visualizations reveal and explicitly communicate structures underlying data. Although our understanding of what types of features are captured by topological visualizations is good, our understanding of people's perception of those features is not. This paper evaluates the sensitivity of topology-based isocontour, Reeb graph, and persistence diagram visualizations compared to a reference color map visualization for synthetically generated scalar fields on 2-manifold triangular meshes embedded in 3D. In particular, we built and ran a human-subject study that evaluated the perception of data features characterized by Gaussian signals and measured how effectively each visualization technique portrays variations of data features arising from the position and amplitude variation of a mixture of Gaussians. For positional feature variations, the results showed that only the Reeb graph visualization had high sensitivity. For amplitude feature variations, persistence diagrams and color maps demonstrated the highest sensitivity, whereas isocontours showed only weak sensitivity. These results take an important step toward understanding which topology-based tools are best for various data and task scenarios and their effectiveness in conveying topological variations as

mapping.","article_number":"10292439","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10292439","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292439/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292439/","publication_title":"IEEE

adoption of digitization, more and more historical visualizations created hundreds of years ago are accessible in digital libraries online. It provides a unique opportunity for visualization and history research. Meanwhile, there is no large-scale digital collection dedicated to historical visualizations. The visualizations are scattered in various collections, which hinders retrieval. In this study, we curate the first large-scale dataset dedicated to historical visualizations. Our dataset comprises 13K historical visualization images with corresponding processed metadata from seven digital libraries. In curating the dataset, we propose a workflow to scrape and process heterogeneous metadata. We develop a semi-automatic labeling approach to distinguish visualizations from other artifacts.

We report on findings from a qualitative study based on a conceptual framework of sensemaking processes to investigate how both new visual analytics designs and existing tools, primarily data tables, support the cognitive work demanded in avalanche forecasting. While both systems yielded similar analytic outcomes we observed differences in ambiguous sensemaking and the analytic actions either afforded. Our findings challenge conventional visualization design guidance in both perceptual and interaction design, highlighting the need for data interfaces that encourage reflection, provoke alternative interpretations, and support the inherently ambiguous nature of sensemaking in this critical application. We review how different visual and interactive forms support or impede analytic processes and introduce “gisting” as a significant yet unexplored analytic action for visual analytics research. We conclude with design implications for enabling ambiguity in visual analytics tools to scaffold sensemaking in risk assessment.","article_number":"10291029","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10291029","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10291029/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10291029/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"924","end_page":"933","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":169,"insert_date":"20231023","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Forecasting","Hazards","Data visualization","Risk management","Uncertainty","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Complex Systems","Risk Assessment","Sensemaking","Visualization Design"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Ambiguity","Visual Analysis","Interactive","Analytical Tools","Forecasting","Visualization Tool","Alternative Interpretation","Vision Research","Interaction Design","Visual Design","Critical Applications","Sense-making Process","Encouraging Reflection","Raw Data","Prototype","Visual Information","Patterns In Data","Formative Assessment","Central Tendency","Safety Management","Hazard Assessment","Investigation Of Patterns","Hazard Analysis","Complex Domain","Visual Hierarchy","Visual Approach","Unstructured Text","Human Observers","Visual Encoding"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326587","title":"VISPUR: Visual Aids for Identifying and Interpreting Spurious Associations in Data-Driven Decisions","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":88,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Pittsburgh, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086887932","id":37086887932,"full_name":"Xian Teng","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Pittsburgh, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Pittsburgh, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087099878","id":37087099878,"full_name":"Yongsu Ahn","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Pittsburgh, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Pittsburgh, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085999808","id":37085999808,"full_name":"Yu-Ru Lin","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Pittsburgh, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Big data and machine learning tools have jointly empowered humans in making data-driven decisions. However, many of them capture empirical associations that might be spurious due to confounding factors and subgroup heterogeneity. The famous Simpson's paradox is such a phenomenon where aggregated and subgroup-level associations contradict with each other, causing cognitive confusions and difficulty in making adequate interpretations and decisions. Existing tools provide little insights for humans to locate, reason about, and prevent pitfalls of spurious association in practice. We propose VISPUR, a visual analytic system that provides a causal analysis framework and a human-centric workflow for tackling spurious associations. These include a CONFOUNDER DASHBOARD, which can automatically identify possible confounding factors, and a SUBGROUP VIEWER, which allows for the visualization and comparison of diverse subgroup patterns that likely or potentially result in a misinterpretation of causality. Additionally, we propose a REASONING STORYBOARD, which uses a flow-based approach to illustrate paradoxical phenomena, as well as an interactive DECISION DIAGNOSIS panel that helps ensure accountable decision-making. Through an expert interview and a controlled user experiment, our qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed “de-paradox” workflow and the designed visual analytic system are effective in helping human users to identify and understand spurious associations, as well as to make accountable causal decisions.","article_number":"10292663","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10292663","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292663/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292663/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"219","end_page":"229","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":184,"insert_date":"20231023","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Decision making","Training","Interviews","Cognition","Machine learning","Systematics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Causal Analysis","Simpson's Paradox","Spurious Associations","Machine Learning","Decision Making"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Spurious Associations","Data-driven Decision","Visual System","Visual Analysis","Causal Analysis","Machine Learning Tools","Causal Framework","Paradoxical Phenomenon","Paradoxical Phenomena","Observational Studies","Population-based Study","Education System","Valuable Results","Outcome Values","Causal Inference","Subset Of Data","Domain Experts","Online Courses","Online Classes","Clear Visualization","Patterns In Space","Holding Space","Target User","Multidimensional Feature","Multidimensional Quality","Multidimensional Character","Causal Knowledge","Causal Cognition","Code Examples","Task Scenarios","Heterogeneous Subgroups","Ideal Balance","Visual Interface","Visual Design","Covariate Balance","Potential Outcomes Framework","Causal Effect","Cause-and-effect","Cause-effect"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326917","title":"Enthusiastic and Grounded, Avoidant and Cautious: Understanding Public Receptivity to Data and Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":89,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Calgary, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/917066645916491","id":917066645916491,"full_name":"Helen Ai He","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38016653500","id":38016653500,"full_name":"Jagoda Walny","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/826170842304360","id":826170842304360,"full_name":"Sonja Thoma","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"Simon Fraser University, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37285000100","id":37285000100,"full_name":"Sheelagh Carpendale","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Simon Fraser University, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945380800","id":37945380800,"full_name":"Wesley Willett","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary, Canada"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Despite an abundance of open data initiatives aimed to inform and empower “general” audiences, we still know little about the ways people outside of traditional data analysis communities experience and engage with public data and visualizations.

Our findings characterize a set of lived experiences with open data and visualizations in the domain of energy consumption, production, and transmission. This work exposes information receptivity — an individual's transient state of willingness or openness to receive information —as a blind spot for the data visualization community, complementary to but distinct from previous notions of data visualization literacy and engagement. We observed four clusters of receptivity responses to data- and visualization-based rhetoric: Information-Avoidant, Data-Cautious, Data-Enthusiastic, and Domain-Grounded. Based on our findings, we highlight research opportunities for the visualization community. This exploratory work identifies the existence of diverse receptivity responses, highlighting the need to consider audiences with varying levels of openness to new information. Our findings also suggest new approaches for improving the accessibility and inclusivity of open data and visualization initiatives targeted at broad audiences.

Refreshable haptic displays tend to be expensive and thus unavailable to most blind individuals. We propose TactualPlot, an approach to sensory substitution where touch interaction yields auditory (sonified) feedback. The technique relies on embodied cognition for spatial awareness—i.e., individuals can perceive 2D touch locations of their fingers with reference to other 2D locations such as the relative locations of other fingers or chart characteristics that are visualized on touchscreens. Combining touch and sound in this way yields a scalable data exploration method for scatterplots where the data density under the user's fingertips is sampled. The sample regions can optionally be scaled based on how quickly the user moves their hand. Our development of TactualPlot was informed by formative design sessions with a blind collaborator, whose practice while using tactile scatterplots caused us to expand the technique for multiple fingers. We present results from an evaluation comparing our TactualPlot interaction technique to tactile graphics printed on swell touch paper.","article_number":"10308620","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10308620","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10308620/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10308620/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"836","end_page":"846","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":212,"insert_date":"20231103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Sonification","Data visualization","Smart phones","Touch sensitive screens","Blindness","Haptic interfaces","Electronic mail"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Accessibility","sonification","multimodal interaction","crossmodal interaction","visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Sensory Substitution","Exploratory Data","Blind Individuals","Design Sessions","Multiple Fingers","Ultrasonic","Sonication","Interactive","Digital Technologies","Digital System","Digital Devices","Sampling Area","3D Printing","Horizontal Axis","Sensory Systems","Dimensional Data","Assistive Technology","Assistive Devices","Trends Data","Cross-modal","Intermodulation","Expert Review","Participatory Design","User Design","Continuous Interaction","Discrete Action","Physicalism","Tick Marks","Sound Design","Speech Synthesis","Synthetic Voice","Touchscreen Devices","Qualitative Feedback","Design Process","End Of The Trial","End Of Each Trial","Brownian Noise","Red Noise","Force Feedback","Haptic Device"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326915","title":"Vortex Lens: Interactive Vortex Core Line Extraction using Observed Line Integral Convolution","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":91,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Visual Computing Center, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37828701300","id":37828701300,"full_name":"Peter Rautek","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Visual Computing Center, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"]}},{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Visual Computing Center, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089206491","id":37089206491,"full_name":"Xingdi Zhang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Visual Computing Center, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"]}},{"affiliation":"King Abdullah Univ. of Sci. & Technol.

The method is based on an interactive local reference frame estimation that minimizes the observed time derivative of the input flow field $\\mathrm{v}(x, t)$. A locally optimal reference frame $\\mathrm{w}(x, t)$ assists the user in the identification of physically observable vortex structures in Observed Line Integral Convolution (LIC) visualizations. The observed LIC visualizations are interactively computed and displayed in a user-steered vortex lens region, embedded in the context of a conventional LIC visualization outside the lens. The locally optimal reference frame is then used to detect observed critical points, where $\\mathrm{v}=\\mathrm{w}$, which are used to seed vortex core lines. Each vortex core line is computed as a solution of the ordinary differential equation (ODE) $\\dot{w}(t)=\\mathrm{w}(w(t), t)$, with an observed critical point as initial condition $(w(t_{0}), t_{0})$. During integration, we enforce a strict error bound on the difference between the extracted core line and the integration of a path line of the input vector field, i.e., a solution to the ODE $\\dot{v}(t)=\\mathrm{v}(v(t), t)$. We experimentally verify that this error depends on the step size of the core line integration. This ensures that our method extracts Lagrangian vortex core lines that are the simultaneous solution of both ODEs with a numerical error that is controllable by the integration step size. We show the usability of our method in the context of an interactive system using a lens metaphor, and evaluate the results in comparison to state-of-the-art vortex core line extraction methods.","article_number":"10294201","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10294201","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10294201/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10294201/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"55","end_page":"65","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":201,"insert_date":"20231024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Lenses","Visualization","Observers","Optimization","Convolution","Fluids","Linear programming"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Flow visualization","vortex detection","objectivity","observers","reference frames","Lie algebras","visual lens metaphors"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Line Integral","Vortex Core","Line Integral Convolution","Vortex Core Line","Vortex Lens","Step Size","Critical Point","Fluid Flow","Liquid Flow","Fluid Velocity","Reference Frame","Local Optimum","Ordinary Differential Equations","Time Derivative","Flow Field","Vector Field","Steady Flow","Unsteady Flow","Numerical Errors","Integration Step","Vortical Structures","Vortex Structures","Optimal Reference","Pathlines","Rigid Transformation","Rigid Motion","Time-dependent Function","Proximal Algorithm","Input Field","Interactive Exploration","Joint Optimization","Flow Velocity","Flow Speed","Velocity Field","Average Error Rate","Isometry","Time Step"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326519","title":"Visualization of Discontinuous Vector Field Topology","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":92,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Heidelberg University, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/113628979185984","id":113628979185984,"full_name":"Egzon Miftari","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Heidelberg University, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Heidelberg University, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/399390595869660","id":399390595869660,"full_name":"Daniel Durstewitz","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Heidelberg University, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Heidelberg University, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282541900","id":37282541900,"full_name":"Filip Sadlo","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Heidelberg University, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"This paper extends the concept and the visualization of vector field topology to vector fields with discontinuities.

ST series visualization is an effective means of understanding the data and reviewing spatiotemporal phenomena, which is a prerequisite for in-depth data analysis. However, visualizing these series is challenging due to their large scales, inherent dynamics, and spatiotemporal nature. In this study, we introduce the notion of patterns of evolution in ST series. Each evolution pattern is characterized by 1) a set of ST series that are close in space and 2) a time period when the trends of these ST series are correlated. We then leverage Storyline techniques by considering an analogy between evolution patterns and sessions, and finally design a novel visualization called GeoChron, which is capable of visualizing large-scale ST series in an evolution pattern-aware and narrative-preserving manner. GeoChron includes a mining framework to extract evolution patterns and two-level visualizations to enhance its visual scalability. We evaluate GeoChron with two case studies, an informal user study, an ablation study, parameter analysis, and running time analysis.","article_number":"10297582","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10297582","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10297582/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10297582/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"1194","end_page":"1204","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":365,"insert_date":"20231026","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Market research","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Correlation","Data visualization","Time series analysis","Layout"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Spatiotemporal visualization","spatial time series","Storyline"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Time Series","Spatial Time Series","Large-scale Time Series","Running Time","Evolutionary Patterns","Developmental Patterns","Atmospheric Sciences","Inherent Dynamics","Runtime Analysis","Air Pollution","Air Quality","Temporal Dynamics","Temporal Information","Cartographic","Spatial Context","Time Stamp","Spatiotemporal Analysis","Correlation Trend","Spatiotemporal Data","Time Slice","Yangtze River Delta","Line Chart","Adjacent Slices","Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei Region","Beijing Tianjin Hebei Region","Aligned Pairs","Spatiotemporal Relationship","Vast Space","Pattern Mining","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Big Data Analytics"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327187","title":"Classes are Not Clusters: Improving Label-Based Evaluation of Dimensionality Reduction","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":94,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Seoul National University, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088656795","id":37088656795,"full_name":"Hyeon Jeon","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Seoul National University, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089416288","id":37089416288,"full_name":"Yun-Hsin Kuo","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Qatar Computing Research Institute, Hamad Bin Khalifa University, Qatar","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085428074","id":37085428074,"full_name":"Michaël Aupetit","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Qatar Computing Research Institute, Hamad Bin Khalifa University, Qatar"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275869400","id":37275869400,"full_name":"Kwan-Liu Ma","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Seoul National University, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37422552700","id":37422552700,"full_name":"Jinwook Seo","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Seoul National University, South Korea"]}}]},"access_type":"OPEN_ACCESS","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"A common way to evaluate the reliability of dimensionality reduction (DR) embeddings is to quantify how well labeled classes form compact, mutually separated clusters in the embeddings. This approach is based on the assumption that the classes stay as clear clusters in the original high-dimensional space. However, in reality, this assumption can be violated; a single class can be fragmented into multiple separated clusters, and multiple classes can be merged into a single cluster. We thus cannot always assure the credibility of the evaluation using class labels. In this paper, we introduce two novel quality measures—Label-Trustworthiness and Label-Continuity (Label-T&C)—advancing the process of DR evaluation based on class labels. Instead of assuming that classes are well-clustered in the original space, Label-T&C work by (1) estimating the extent to which classes form clusters in the original and embedded spaces and (2) evaluating the difference between the two. A quantitative evaluation showed that Label-T&C outperform widely used DR evaluation measures (e.g., Trustworthiness and Continuity, Kullback-Leibler divergence) in terms of the accuracy in assessing how well DR embeddings preserve the cluster structure, and are also scalable. Moreover, we present case studies demonstrating that Label-T&C can be successfully used for revealing the intrinsic characteristics of DR techniques and their hyperparameters.","article_number":"10308618","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10308618","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10308618/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10308618/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"781","end_page":"791","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":317,"insert_date":"20231103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Distortion measurement","Reliability","Dimensionality reduction","Nonlinear distortion","Extraterrestrial measurements","Scalability","Degradation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Dimensionality Reduction","Reliability","Clustering","Clustering Validation Measures","Dimensionality Reduction Evaluation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Dimensionality Reduction","Process Evaluation","Class Labels","Kullback-Leibler","Relative Entropy","Kullback Leibler Divergence","KL Divergence","Cluster Structure","Original Space","Clear Clustering","Distortion","Data Structure","Generation Process","Local Structure","Local Measurements","Global Measures","Data Space","Clustering Techniques","Level Of Granularity","Hyperparameter Settings","Distance Scale","Adjusted Rand Index","Low-dimensional Embedding","Distortion Measure","Coarse-grained Structure","Silhouette Coefficient","Distortion Types","Cluster Validity","Shift Invariance","Variable Shift","Davies-Bouldin Index","Structural Reliability","Scale-invariant","Number Of Data Points"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326933","title":"Global Topology of 3D Symmetric Tensor Fields","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":95,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086114114","id":37086114114,"full_name":"Shih-Hsuan Hung","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085665492","id":37085665492,"full_name":"Yue Zhang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37398562200","id":37398562200,"full_name":"Eugene Zhang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"There have been recent advances in the analysis and visualization of 3D symmetric tensor fields, with a focus on the robust extraction of tensor field topology. However, topological features such as degenerate curves and neutral surfaces do not live in isolation. Instead, they intriguingly interact with each other. In this paper, we introduce the notion of topological graph for 3D symmetric tensor fields to facilitate global topological analysis of such fields. The nodes of the graph include degenerate curves and regions bounded by neutral surfaces in the domain. The edges in the graph denote the adjacency information between the regions and degenerate curves. In addition, we observe that a degenerate curve can be a loop and even a knot and that two degenerate curves (whether in the same region or not) can form a link. We provide a definition and theoretical analysis of individual degenerate curves in order to help understand why knots and links may occur. Moreover, we differentiate between wedges and trisectors, thus making the analysis more detailed about degenerate curves. We incorporate this information into the topological graph. Such a graph can not only reveal the global structure in a 3D symmetric tensor field but also allow two symmetric tensor fields to be compared. We demonstrate our approach by applying it to solid mechanics and material science data sets.","article_number":"10294203","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10294203","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10294203/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10294203/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"1282","end_page":"1291","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":135,"insert_date":"20231024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Tensors","Structural rings","Three-dimensional displays","Topology","Stress","Feature extraction","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Tensor field visualization","3D symmetric tensor fields","global tensor field topology","topological graphs","degenerate curves","neutral surfaces","wedges and trisectors"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Symmetric Tensor","Global Topology","Symmetric Tensor Field","Global Analysis","Materials Science","Field Of Analysis","Nodes In The Graph","Topological Features","Topological Characteristics","Graph Topology","Solid Mechanics","Hardening Mechanism","Curing Mechanism","3D Field","Neutral Surface","Recent Advances In Analysis","Symmetric Field","3D Tensor","Air Bubbles","Gas Bubbles","Poisson’s Ratio","Vector Field","Surface Curvature","Open Curves","Degenerate Points","Planar Regions","Betti Numbers","Winding Number","Red Segments","Positive Eigenvalues","Magnitude Of Load","Top Face","Three-fold Symmetry","Field Curves"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327150","title":"EMPHASISCHECKER: A Tool for Guiding Chart and Caption Emphasis","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":96,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"KAIST, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/220244769523736","id":220244769523736,"full_name":"Dae Hyun Kim","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["KAIST, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"KAIST, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/686965609211283","id":686965609211283,"full_name":"Seulgi Choi","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["KAIST, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"KAIST, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087269543","id":37087269543,"full_name":"Juho Kim","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["KAIST, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Tableau Research, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37392286200","id":37392286200,"full_name":"Vidya Setlur","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tableau Research, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Stanford University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282718200","id":37282718200,"full_name":"Maneesh Agrawala","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Stanford University, USA","Roblox, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Recent work has shown that when both the chart and caption emphasize the same aspects of the data, readers tend to remember the doubly-emphasized features as takeaways; when there is a mismatch, readers rely on the chart to form takeaways and can miss information in the caption text.

The tool implements a time-series prominent feature detector based on the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm and a text reference extractor that identifies time references and data descriptions in the caption and matches them with chart data. This information enables authors to compare features emphasized by these two modalities, quickly see mismatches, and make necessary revisions.

Here, our goal is to start an evolving discussion on how to represent data on gender in data visualizations and raise awareness of the subtleties of choosing visual variables and words in gender visualizations. In order to ground this discussion, we collected and coded gender visualizations and their captions from five different scientific communities (Biology, Politics, Social Studies, Visualisation, and Human-Computer Interaction), in addition to images from Tableau Public and the Information Is Beautiful awards showcase. Overall we found that representation types are community-specific, color hue is the dominant visual channel for gender data, and nonconforming gender is under-represented.

The Location Graph is a novel uncertainty-aware visualization method that employs improved circle packing to represent spatial hierarchy. The map view intuitively shows the overall circulation by clustering and allows zooming into single book trajectory with lenses magnifying local movements. The timeline view ranks dynamically in response to user interaction to facilitate the discovery of temporal events.

analytics. Analyzing and understanding the query execution process of these systems are daily routines for engineers and crucial for identifying performance problems, optimizing system configurations, and rectifying errors. However, existing visualization tools for distributed query execution are insufficient because (i) most of them (if not all) do not provide fine-grained visualization (i.e., the atomic task level), which can be crucial for understanding query performance and reasoning about the underlying execution anomalies, and (ii) they do not support proper linkages between system status and query execution, which makes it difficult to identify the causes of execution problems. To tackle these limitations, we propose QEVIS, which visualizes distributed query execution process with multiple views that focus on different granularities and complement each other. Specifically, we first devise a query logical plan layout algorithm to visualize the overall query execution progress compactly and clearly. We then propose two novel scoring methods to summarize the anomaly degrees of the jobs and machines during query execution, and visualize the anomaly scores intuitively, which allow users to easily identify the components that are worth paying attention to. Moreover, we devise a scatter plot-based task view to show a massive number of atomic tasks, where task distribution patterns are informative for execution problems.

In this paper, we describe a novel approach for similarity analysis of scalar fields that combines two recently introduced techniques: Wasserstein geodesics/barycenters as well as path mappings, a branch decomposition-independent edit distance. Effectively, we are able to leverage the reduced susceptibility of path mappings to small perturbations in the data when compared with the original Wasserstein distance. Our approach therefore exhibits superior performance and quality in typical tasks such as ensemble summarization, ensemble clustering, and temporal reduction of time series, while retaining practically feasible runtimes. Beyond studying theoretical properties of our approach and discussing implementation aspects, we describe a number of case studies that provide empirical insights into its utility for comparative visualization, and demonstrate the advantages of our method in both synthetic and real-world scenarios. We supply a C++ implementation that can be used to reproduce our results.","article_number":"10296528","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10296528","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10296528/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10296528/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"1095","end_page":"1105","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":173,"insert_date":"20231025","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Time series analysis","Data visualization","Level measurement","Task analysis","Layout","Surveys","Interpolation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Topological data analysis","merge trees","scalar data","ensemble data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Merging Algorithm","Merge Tree","Time Series","Similarity Measure","Similarity Metrics","Edit Distance","Temporary Reduction","Time Series Clustering","Ensemble Clustering","Interpolation","Time Step","Running Time","Distancing Measures","Local Minima","Subtree","Distance Map","Distance Transform","Distance Field","Sum Of Distances","Scalar Value","Feature Tracking","Topological Indices","Topological Index","Topological Descriptors","Adjusted Rand Index","Key Frames","Scientific Visualization","Update Procedure","Sublevel Set","Superlevel Sets","Minutes Range","Edge Labels","Input Tree","Precise Reconstruction","Simple Topology","Time Series Analysis"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327107","title":"Photon Field Networks for Dynamic Real-Time Volumetric Global Illumination","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":101,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089013553","id":37089013553,"full_name":"David Bauer","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088599212","id":37088599212,"full_name":"Qi Wu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275869400","id":37275869400,"full_name":"Kwan-Liu Ma","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Volume data is commonly found in many scientific disciplines, like medicine, physics, and biology. Experts rely on robust scientific visualization techniques to extract valuable insights from the data. Recent years have shown path tracing to be the preferred approach for volumetric rendering, given its high levels of realism. However, real-time volumetric path tracing often suffers from stochastic noise and long convergence times, limiting interactive exploration. In this paper, we present a novel method to enable real-time global illumination for volume data visualization. We develop Photon Field Networks—a phase-function-aware, multi-light neural representation of indirect volumetric global illumination. The fields are trained on multi-phase photon caches that we compute a priori. Training can be done within seconds, after which the fields can be used in various rendering tasks. To showcase their potential, we develop a custom neural path tracer, with which our photon fields achieve interactive framerates even on large datasets. We conduct in-depth evaluations of the method's performance, including visual quality, stochastic noise, inference and rendering speeds, and accuracy regarding illumination and phase function awareness. Results are compared to ray marching, path tracing and photon mapping. Our findings show that Photon Field Networks can faithfully represent indirect global illumination within the boundaries of the trained phase spectrum while exhibiting less stochastic noise and rendering at a significantly faster rate than traditional methods.","article_number":"10297590","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10297590","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10297590/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10297590/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"975","end_page":"985","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":201,"insert_date":"20231026","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Photonics","Rendering (computer graphics)","Lighting","Data visualization","Real-time systems","Light sources","Visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Volume data","volume rendering","volume visualization","deep learning","global illumination","neural rendering","path tracing"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Photon Field","Interactive","Volume Of Data","Intensity Data","Neural Representations","Neural Encoding","Neural Coding","Visual Quality","Phase Function","Spectral Phase","Phase Spectrum","Stochastic Noise","Neural Tracing","Scientific Visualization","Neural Network","Functional Changes","Changes In Performance","Light Source","Image Quality","Final Value","Transfer Function","Density Estimation","Multilayer Perceptron","Training Loss","Fraction Of Time","Neural Field","Direct Illumination","Range Query","Traditional Path","Direct Light","Sampling Step","Ray Tracing","Input Domain","Large Number Of Photons"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326513","title":"The Rational Agent Benchmark for Data Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":102,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Northwestern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088865817","id":37088865817,"full_name":"Yifan Wu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088750906","id":37088750906,"full_name":"Ziyang Guo","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/323685615033507","id":323685615033507,"full_name":"Michalis Mamakos","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37551276500","id":37551276500,"full_name":"Jason Hartline","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38016234500","id":38016234500,"full_name":"Jessica Hullman","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Understanding how helpful a visualization is from experimental results is difficult because the observed performance is confounded with aspects of the study design, such as how useful the information that is visualized is for the task.

We design and implement Dupo, a mixedinitiative approach to creating responsive visualizations that combines the agency afforded by a manual interface with automation provided by a recommender system. Given an initial design, users can browse automated design suggestions for a different screen type and make edits to a chosen design, thereby supporting quick prototyping and customizability. Dupo employs a two-step recommender pipeline that first suggests significant design changes (Exploration) followed by more subtle changes (Alteration). We evaluated Dupo with six expert responsive visualization authors. While creating responsive versions of a source design in Dupo, participants could reason about different design suggestions without having to manually prototype them, and thus avoid prematurely fixating on a particular design. This process led participants to create designs that they were satisfied with but which they had previously overlooked.","article_number":"10290918","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10290918","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10290918/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10290918/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"934","end_page":"943","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":158,"insert_date":"20231023","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Pipelines","Bars","Automation","Authoring systems","Annotations"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","responsive visualization","mixed-initiative authoring"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Authoring Tool","Recommender Systems","Iterative Design","Loop Design","Design Ideas","Adaptive System","Search Space","Graphical User Interface","Graphical Interface","Design Considerations","Bar Charts","Alternative Designs","Alternative Names","Design Patterns","User Control","Manual Editing","Visual Design","Line Chart","Usage Scenarios","Transformation Strategy","Transformation Scheme","Textual Elements","Visual Encoding","Stacked Bar Charts","Desktop Version","User Constraints","Constraint For Each User","High-level Design","Higher-level Design","Mobile Version","Control Panel","Response Strategies","Design Process","Data Transformation","Direct Use","Direct Utilization","Direct Manipulation","Aspect Ratio"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326580","title":"Wizualization: A “Hard Magic” Visualization System for Immersive and Ubiquitous Analytics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":104,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Washington, D.C., United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086246405","id":37086246405,"full_name":"Andrea Batch","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Washington, D.C., United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Bangor University, Bangor, United Kingdom","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086303595","id":37086303595,"full_name":"Peter W.

In this paper, we introduce TopoSZ, an error-bounded lossy compression method that preserves the topological features in 2D and 3D scalar fields. Specifically, we aim to preserve the types and locations of local extrema as well as the level set relations among critical points captured by contour trees in the decompressed data. The main idea is to derive topological constraints from contour-tree-induced segmentation from the data domain, and incorporate such constraints with a customized error-controlled quantization strategy from the SZ compressor (version 1.4). Our method allows users to control the pointwise error and the loss of topological features during the compression process with a global error bound and a persistence threshold.","article_number":"10309863","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10309863","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10309863/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10309863/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"1302","end_page":"1312","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":159,"insert_date":"20231106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Quantization (signal)","Topology","Image coding","Encoding","Level set","Three-dimensional displays","Error correction"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Lossy compression","contour tree","topology preservation","topological data analysis","topology in visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Lossy Compression","Characteristics Of Data","Features Of Data","Critical Point","Source Code","Data Compression","Topological Features","Topological Characteristics","Compression Process","2D Feature","2D Character","Local Extrema","Topological Constraints","Topological Methods","Lower Bound","Lower Binding","Upper Bound","Peak Signal-to-noise Ratio","PSNR","Error Control","Error Checking","Error Bounds","Compression Ratio","3D Datasets","Relaxed Constraints","Compression Rate","Original Field","Scientific Visualization","Compression Quality","Wasserstein Distance","Wasserstein Metric","Regular Points","Regular Value","Lossless Compression","Lossless Data Compression","Rate-distortion","Rate-distortion Function","Rate-distortion Theory","Topological Indices","Topological Index","Topological Descriptors","Values Of Data Points","Value For Each Data Point","High Compression Ratio","Runtime Analysis"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326936","title":"Marjorie: Visualizing Type 1 Diabetes Data to Support Pattern Exploration","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":106,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/461089547513979","id":461089547513979,"full_name":"Anna Scimone","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089848351","id":37089848351,"full_name":"Klaus Eckelt","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403918900","id":37403918900,"full_name":"Marc Streit","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088767380","id":37088767380,"full_name":"Andreas Hinterreiter","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria"]}}]},"access_type":"CCBY - IEEE is not the copyright holder of this material.

Designed in consultation with diabetologists, Marjorie uses a combination of visual and algorithmic methods to support the exploration of patterns in the data. Patterns of interest include seasonal variations of the glucose profiles, and non-periodic patterns such as fluctuations around mealtimes or periods of hypoglycemia (i.e., glucose levels below the normal range). We introduce a unique representation of glucose data based on modified horizon graphs and hierarchical clustering of adjacent carbohydrate or insulin entries. Semantic zooming allows the exploration of patterns on different levels of temporal detail. We evaluated our solution in a case study, which demonstrated Marjorie's potential to provide valuable insights into therapy parameters and unfavorable eating habits, among others. The study results and informal feedback collected from target users suggest that Marjorie effectively supports patients and diabetologists in the joint exploration of patterns in diabetes data, potentially enabling more informed treatment decisions.

However, on-the-fly computation slows down algorithms and results in a negative impact on the time performance. To address this issue, we propose a new task-parallel approach to proactively compute mesh connectivity. Unlike previous approaches implementing data-parallel models, where all threads run the same type of instructions, our task-parallel approach allows threads to run different functions. Specifically, some threads run the algorithm of choice while other threads compute connectivity information before they are actually needed. The approach was implemented in the new Accelerated Clustered TOPOlogical (ACTOPO) data structure, which can support any processing algorithm requiring mesh connectivity information. Our experiments show that ACTOPO combines the benefits of state-of-the-art memory-efficient (TTK CompactTriangulation) and time-efficient (TTK ExplicitTriangulation) topological data structures. It occupies a similar amount of memory as TTK CompactTriangulation while providing up to 5x speedup. Moreover, it achieves comparable time performance as TTK ExplicitTriangulation while using only half of the memory space.","article_number":"10302662","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10302662","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10302662/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10302662/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"1271","end_page":"1281","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":157,"insert_date":"20231031","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data structures","Task analysis","Faces","Memory management","Instruction sets","Computational modeling","Graphics processing units"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data structures","parallel computation","topological data analysis","simplicial complex"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Structure","Topological Structure","Topological Data","Topological Structure Of Data","Structural Dynamics","Processing Algorithms","Connectivity Information","Information In Conjunction","Unstructured Mesh","Triangular","Triangle","Supplemental Material","Parallelization","Parallel Computing","State Structures","Types Of Relationships","Linear Order","Total Order","Simple Order","Memory Usage","Sequential Algorithm","Serial Algorithm","Single Thread","Simplicial Complex","Parallel Algorithm","Algorithm Execution","Topological Relations","Merging Algorithm","Merge Tree","Tetrahedral Mesh","Block Index","Block Indices","Multiple Threads","Spatial Buffer","Adjacency Relationship","Execution Time Of Algorithm","Execution Time Of Each Algorithm","Memory Footprint","Seismic","Earthquake"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327361","title":"Handling Non-Visible Referents in Situated Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":108,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Inria, CNRS, Université de Bordeaux, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/360160763405841","id":360160763405841,"full_name":"Ambre Assor","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Inria, CNRS, Université de Bordeaux, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Inria, CNRS, Université de Bordeaux, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086068796","id":37086068796,"full_name":"Arnaud Prouzeau","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Inria, CNRS, Université de Bordeaux, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Inria, CNRS, Université de Bordeaux, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37668187500","id":37668187500,"full_name":"Martin Hachet","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Inria, CNRS, Université de Bordeaux, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Inria, CNRS, Université de Bordeaux, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590932700","id":37590932700,"full_name":"Pierre Dragicevic","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Inria, CNRS, Université de Bordeaux, France"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Situated visualizations are a type of visualization where data is presented next to its physical referent (i.e., the physical object, space, or person it refers to), often using augmented-reality displays.

However, in practice, a physical referent may be obscured by another object, such as a wall, or may be outside the user's visual field. In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework and a design space to help researchers and user interface designers handle non-visible referents in situated visualizations. We first provide an overview of techniques proposed in the past for dealing with non-visible objects in the areas of 3D user interfaces, 3D visualization, and mixed reality. From this overview, we derive a design space that applies to situated visualizations and employ it to examine various trade-offs, challenges, and opportunities for future research in this area.","article_number":"10296000","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10296000","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10296000/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10296000/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"1336","end_page":"1346","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":211,"insert_date":"20231025","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Visualization","Terminology","Augmented reality","Task analysis","Surveys"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Taxonomy","Models","Frameworks","Theory","Mobile","AR/VR/Immersive","Specialized Input/Display Hardware"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Conceptual Framework","Physical Body","Physical Objects","Physical Form","Physical Entities","Design Space","3D Visualization","Opportunities For Future Research","Mixed Reality","Type Of Visualization","Interactive","Caregivers","Carers","Field Of View","Data Visualization","Survey Methods","Survey Methodology","Refresh Rate","Field Evaluation","Object Of Interest","Physical World","High Integration","Firefighters","Digital Twin","Home Appliances","Air Quality Data","Maintenance Tasks","Representative Reference","Physical Surroundings","Descriptive Power","Augmented Reality System","Family Of Techniques","Computer-generated Images","Directions For Future Work","Rescue Teams"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327171","title":"PSRFlow: Probabilistic Super Resolution with Flow-Based Models for Scientific Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":109,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641667","id":37089641667,"full_name":"Jingyi Shen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, United States"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, United States","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279493500","id":37279493500,"full_name":"Han-Wei Shen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, United States"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Although many deep-learning-based super-resolution approaches have been proposed in recent years, because no ground truth is available in the inference stage, few can quantify the errors and uncertainties of the super-resolved results. For scientific visualization applications, however, conveying uncertainties of the results to scientists is crucial to avoid generating misleading or incorrect information. In this paper, we propose PSRFlow, a novel normalizing flow-based generative model for scientific data super-resolution that incorporates uncertainty quantification into the super-resolution process. PSRFlow learns the conditional distribution of the high-resolution data based on the low-resolution counterpart. By sampling from a Gaussian latent space that captures the missing information in the high-resolution data, one can generate different plausible super-resolution outputs. The efficient sampling in the Gaussian latent space allows our model to perform uncertainty quantification for the super-resolved results. During model training, we augment the training data with samples across various scales to make the model adaptable to data of different scales, achieving flexible super-resolution for a given input. Our results demonstrate superior performance and robust uncertainty quantification compared with existing methods such as interpolation and GAN-based super-resolution networks.","article_number":"10309865","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10309865","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10309865/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10309865/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"986","end_page":"996","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":214,"insert_date":"20231106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Superresolution","Uncertainty","Data models","Data visualization","Gaussian distribution","Probabilistic logic","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Super resolution","latent space","normalizing flow","uncertainty visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Missing Information","Conditional Distribution","Distribution Of Status","High-resolution Data","Latent Space","Embedding Space","Uncertainty Quantification","Inference Stage","Super-resolution Approaches","Scientific Visualization","Super-resolution Results","Time Step","Model Size","Generative Adversarial Networks","Adversarial Learning","Learning-based Methods","Data Space","Baseline Methods","Peak Signal-to-noise Ratio","PSNR","Deep Learning-based Methods","Isosurface","Normal Flow","Ensemble Members","Low-resolution Data","Lower-resolution Data","Low-resolution Input","Original Data Space","Trilinear Interpolation","Structural Similarity Index Measure","Simple Distribution","High-quality Results","High-quality Outcomes","Gradient Magnitude","Differential Transformation","High-resolution Reconstruction"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326919","title":"Image or Information?

In this study, we investigate the nature of internalization for visualizations (i.e., how the mind encodes visualizations in memory) and how memory encoding affects its retrieval. This exploratory work examines the influence of various design elements on a user's perception of a chart. Specifically, which design elements lead to perceptions of visualization as an image (aims to provide visual references, evoke emotions, express creativity, and inspire philosophic thought) or as information (aims to present complex data, information, or ideas concisely and promote analytical thinking)? Understanding how design elements contribute to viewers perceiving a visualization more as an image or information will help designers decide which elements to include to achieve their communication goals. For this study, we annotated 500 visualizations and analyzed the responses of 250 online participants, who rated the visualizations on a bilinear scale as ‘image’ or ‘information.’ We then conducted an in-person study ($n = 101$) using a free recall task to examine how the image/information ratings and design elements impacted memory. The results revealed several interesting findings: Image-rated visualizations were perceived as more aesthetically ‘appealing,’ ‘enjoyable,’ and ‘pleasing.’ Information-rated visualizations were perceived as less ‘difficult to understand’ and more aesthetically ‘likable’ and ‘nice,’ though participants expressed higher ‘positive’ sentiment when viewing image-rated visualizations and felt less ‘guided to a conclusion.’ The presence of axes and text annotations heavily influenced the likelihood of participants rating the visualization as ‘information.’ We also found different patterns among participants that were older. Importantly, we show that visualizations internalized as ‘images’ are less effective in conveying trends and messages, though they elicit a more positive emotional judgment, while ‘informative’ visualizations exhibit annotation focused recall and elicit a more positive design judgment. We discuss the implications of this dissociation between aesthetic pleasure and perceived ease of use in visualization design.","article_number":"10294209","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10294209","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10294209/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10294209/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"1030","end_page":"1040","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":227,"insert_date":"20231024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Task analysis","Economics","Sports","Meteorology","Geology"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Information Visualization","Human-Centered Computing","Perception & Cognition","Takeaways"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Popularity","Populist","Usability","Ease Of Use","Pleased","Design Elements","Free Recall","Visual Design","Analytical Thinking","Positive Judgments","Text Annotation","Aesthetic Pleasure","Free Recall Task","Audience","Emotional Responses","Emotional Reactions","Data Visualization","Visual Information","Presence Of Elements","Design Choices","Bar Charts","Infographic","Graphical Display","Visual Encoding","Score Interval","Internal Scores","Visual Elements","Pictograms","Pictographs","Chart Types","Verbal Recall","User Engagement","Customer Engagement","Positive Emotional Responses","December 2010"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326921","title":"A Comparative Visual Analytics Framework for Evaluating Evolutionary Processes in Multi-Objective Optimization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":111,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089857218","id":37089857218,"full_name":"Yansong Huang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089167807","id":37089167807,"full_name":"Zherui Zhang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088947577","id":37088947577,"full_name":"Ao Jiao","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101494","id":37087101494,"full_name":"Yuxin Ma","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37071084500","id":37071084500,"full_name":"Ran Cheng","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithms have been demonstrated to be effective in solving multi-criteria decision-making problems. In real-world applications, analysts often employ several algorithms concurrently and compare their solution sets to gain insight into the characteristics of different algorithms and explore a broader range of feasible solutions. However, EMO algorithms are typically treated as black boxes, leading to difficulties in performing detailed analysis and comparisons between the internal evolutionary processes. Inspired by the successful application of visual analytics tools in explainable AI, we argue that interactive visualization can significantly enhance the comparative analysis between multiple EMO algorithms. In this paper, we present a visual analytics framework that enables the exploration and comparison of evolutionary processes in EMO algorithms. Guided by a literature review and expert interviews, the proposed framework addresses various analytical tasks and establishes a multi-faceted visualization design to support the comparative analysis of intermediate generations in the evolution as well as solution sets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through case studies on benchmarking and real-world multi-objective optimization problems to elucidate how analysts can leverage our framework to inspect and compare diverse algorithms.","article_number":"10294213","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10294213","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10294213/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10294213/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"661","end_page":"671","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":465,"insert_date":"20231024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Optimization","Analytical models","Visual analytics","Task analysis","Predictive models","Computational modeling","Machine learning algorithms"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","evolutionary multi-objective optimization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Development Process","Evolutionary Processes","Visual Analysis","Multi-objective Optimization","Multi-objective Problem","Visual Framework","Visual Analytics Framework","Comparative Analysis","Comparison Analysis","Optimization Algorithm","Black Box","Analysis Tasks","Multiple Algorithms","Interactive Visualization","Multi-criteria Decision-making","Multi-criteria Decision Analysis","Multi-objective Optimization Problem","Expert Interviews","Visual Design","Benchmark Problems","Explainable Artificial Intelligence","Explainable AI","Explainable Machine Learning","Multi-objective Optimization Algorithm","Quality Measures","Performance Of Algorithm","Objective Vector","Objective Space","Pareto Front","Pareto Frontier","Evolutionary Algorithms","Development Of Algorithms","Test Problems","Visual Exploration","Line Chart","Solutions In Set","Wasserstein Distance","Wasserstein Metric","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326941","title":"Design Characterization for Black-and-White Textures in Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":112,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LISN, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089641957","id":37089641957,"full_name":"Tingying He","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LISN, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Tencent Technology (Shenzhen) Company Limited, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/606074961763547","id":606074961763547,"full_name":"Yuanyang Zhong","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tencent Technology (Shenzhen) Company Limited, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LISN, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591317800","id":37591317800,"full_name":"Petra Isenberg","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LISN, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LISN, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37297057400","id":37297057400,"full_name":"Tobias Isenberg","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LISN, France"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We investigate the use of 2D black-and-white textures for the visualization of categorical data and contribute a summary of texture attributes, and the results of three experiments that elicited design strategies as well as aesthetic and effectiveness measures.

Geometric textures use patterns of repeated abstract geometric shapes, while iconic textures use repeated icons that may stand for data categories.

We can model the bias with the average of the data series and the average of the points drawn along the line.

Understanding and predicting this bias is important for visualization design guidelines, recommendation systems, and tool builders, as the bias can adversely affect estimates of averages and trends.","article_number":"10292536","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10292536","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292536/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292536/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"306","end_page":"315","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":256,"insert_date":"20231023","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Time series analysis","Encoding","Visualization","Task analysis","Ink","Market research"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["bias","lines graph","ensemble perception","average"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["High Diversity","High Variation","Average Estimates","Average Approximation","Line Graph","Number Of Values","Preregistered","Line Segment","Average Point","Recommender Systems","Trend Estimates","Linear Model","Linear Regression Model","Time Series","Estimation Error","Error Of Approximation","Time Series Data","Normative Data","Average Data","Random Generation","Random Number Generator","Dot Plots","Line Length","Average Price","Stock Price","Correction Scheme","Correction Strategy","Restoration Strategies","Arc Length","Curve Length","Line Chart","Visual Encoding","Geometric Brownian Motion","Bottom-up Processes","Visual Literacy","Equal Area","Visual Saliency","Open Science Framework"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327403","title":"A Local Iterative Approach for the Extraction of 2D Manifolds from Strongly Curved and Folded Thin-Layer Structures","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":115,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/891064399311933","id":891064399311933,"full_name":"Nicolas Klenert","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Agyptisches Museum und Papyrussammlung, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/185276299113951","id":185276299113951,"full_name":"Verena Lepper","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Agyptisches Museum und Papyrussammlung, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38182750200","id":38182750200,"full_name":"Daniel Baum","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Ridge surfaces represent important features for the analysis of 3-dimensional (3D) datasets in diverse applications and are often derived from varying underlying data including flow fields, geological fault data, and point data, but they can also be present in the original scalar images acquired using a plethora of imaging techniques. Our work is motivated by the analysis of image data acquired using micro-computed tomography ($\\mu\\text{CT}$) of ancient, rolled and folded thin-layer structures such as papyrus, parchment, and paper as well as silver and lead sheets. From these documents we know that they are 2-dimensional (2D) in nature. Hence, we are particularly interested in reconstructing 2D manifolds that approximate the document's structure. The image data from which we want to reconstruct the 2D manifolds are often very noisy and represent folded, densely-layered structures with many artifacts, such as ruptures or layer splitting and merging. Previous ridge-surface extraction methods fail to extract the desired 2D manifold for such challenging data. We have therefore developed a novel method to extract 2D manifolds. The proposed method uses a local fast marching scheme in combination with a separation of the region covered by fast marching into two sub-regions. The 2D manifold of interest is then extracted as the surface separating the two sub-regions. The local scheme can be applied for both automatic propagation as well as interactive analysis. We demonstrate the applicability and robustness of our method on both artificial data as well as real-world data including folded silver and papyrus sheets.","article_number":"10309981","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10309981","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10309981/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10309981/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"1260","end_page":"1270","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":97,"insert_date":"20231106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Faces","Manifolds","Silver","Data mining","Surface reconstruction","Feature extraction","Topology"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Ridge surface","crease surface","2D manifold extraction","fast marching","virtual unfolding","historical documents"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Extraction Approach","Thin Layer Structure","2D Manifold","Imaging Data","Real-world Data","Local Strategies","Local Scheme","Artificial Data","Cost Function","Set Of Equations","Equivalence Classes","Local Maxima","3D Mesh","Surface Mesh","Distance Map","Distance Transform","Distance Field","Optimal Path","Isosurface","Surface Integrity","Solution Curve","Integral Curves","Boundary Surface","Surface Reconstruction","Medial Surface","Surface Patches","Closed Surface","Background Labeling","Border Points","Dimensional Manifold","Marching Cubes Algorithm","Structure Tensor","Cost Path"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326575","title":"Explore Your Network in Minutes: A Rapid Prototyping Toolkit for Understanding Neural Networks with Visual Analytics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":116,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/992871761143186","id":992871761143186,"full_name":"Shaoxuan Lai","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/538580526201846","id":538580526201846,"full_name":"Wanna Luan","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, National Supercomputer Center, Guangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086054207","id":37086054207,"full_name":"Jun Tao","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, National Supercomputer Center, Guangzhou, China","Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory, Zhuhai, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Neural networks attract significant attention in almost every field due to their widespread applications in various tasks. However, developers often struggle with debugging due to the black-box nature of neural networks. Visual analytics provides an intuitive way for developers to understand the hidden states and underlying complex transformations in neural networks. Existing visual analytics tools for neural networks have been demonstrated to be effective in providing useful hints for debugging certain network architectures. However, these approaches are often architecture-specific with strong assumptions of how the network should be understood. This limits their use when the network architecture or the exploration goal changes. In this paper, we present a general model and a programming toolkit, Neural Network Visualization Builder (NNVisBuilder), for prototyping visual analytics systems to understand neural networks. NNVisBuilder covers the common data transformation and interaction model involved in existing tools for exploring neural networks. It enables developers to customize a visual analytics interface for answering their specific questions about networks. NNVisBuilder is compatible with PyTorch so that developers can integrate the visualization code into their learning code seamlessly. We demonstrate the applicability by reproducing several existing visual analytics systems for networks with NNVisBuilder.

Realistically and efficiently detecting and tracking TCs are critical for assessing their impacts and risks. In particular, the eye is a signature feature of a mature TC. Therefore, knowing the eyes' locations and movements is crucial for both operational weather forecasts and climate risk assessments. Recently, a multilevel robustness framework has been introduced to study the critical points of time-varying vector fields. The framework quantifies the robustness (i.e., structural stability) of critical points across varying neighborhoods. By relating the multilevel robustness with critical point tracking, the framework has demonstrated its potential in cyclone tracking. An advantage is that it identifies cyclonic features using only 2D wind vector fields, which is encouraging as most tracking algorithms require multiple dynamic and thermodynamic variables at different altitudes. A disadvantage is that the framework does not scale well computationally for datasets containing a large number of cyclones. This paper introduces a topologically robust physics-informed tracking framework (TROPHY) for TC tracking. The main idea is to integrate physical knowledge of TC to drastically improve the computational efficiency of multilevel robustness framework for large-scale climate datasets. First, during preprocessing, we propose a physics-informed feature selection strategy to filter 90% of critical points that are short-lived and have low stability, thus preserving good candidates for TC tracking. Second, during in-processing, we impose constraints during the multilevel robustness computation to focus only on physics-informed neighborhoods of TCs. We apply TROPHY to 30 years of 2D wind fields from reanalysis data in ERA5 and generate a number of TC tracks. In comparison with the observed tracks, we demonstrate that TROPHY can capture TC characteristics (e.g., frequency, intensity, duration, latitudes with maximum intensity, and genesis) that are comparable to and sometimes even better than a well-validated TC tracking algorithm that requires multiple dynamic and thermodynamic scalar fields.","article_number":"10309869","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10309869","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10309869/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10309869/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"1249","end_page":"1259","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":152,"insert_date":"20231106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Robustness","Meteorology","Topology","Heuristic algorithms","Feature extraction","Wind speed","Tropical cyclones"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Feature tracking","robustness","topology-based methods in visualization","applications","climate science","tropical cyclones"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Altitude","Critical Point","Large-scale Datasets","Vector Field","Tracking Algorithm","Robust Framework","Thermodynamic State","Thermodynamic Variables","Multilevel Framework","Spatial Patterns","Spatiotemporal Patterns","Temporal Patterns","Time Step","Atmospheric Pressure","Sea Level Pressure","Air Pressure","Barometric Pressure","Years Of Data","Annual Data","Climatological","Climate Research","Climate Science","Entire Domain","Symmetric Structure","Zonal Wind","Zonal Flow","Density Patterns","Storm Surge","Tracking Results","Points In Domain","Maximum Wind Speed","Feature Tracking","Merging Algorithm","Merge Tree","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Part Of The Track","2D Vector","Smoothing Value","Unstable Characteristics","Unstable Features","Eyewall","Eye Features","Clear-eyed","Characteristics Of Eyes","Storm Intensity"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326927","title":"Interactive Design and Optics-Based Visualization of Arbitrary Non-Euclidean Kaleidoscopic Orbifolds","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":118,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Oregon State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086322614","id":37086322614,"full_name":"Jinta Zheng","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oregon State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Oregon State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37398562200","id":37398562200,"full_name":"Eugene Zhang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oregon State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Oregon State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085665492","id":37085665492,"full_name":"Yue Zhang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oregon State University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Orbifolds are a modern mathematical concept that arises in the research of hyperbolic geometry with applications in computer graphics and visualization.

The corpora are given as document-term matrices, and each document is assigned to a thematic class. The chosen metrics quantify the preservation of local and global properties and the perceptual effectiveness of the two-dimensional scatter plots.

Based on the results, we propose guidelines for the effective design of text spatializations that are based on topic models and dimensionality reductions.

To address this challenge, we present a new visualization paradigm, concept binding, that separates high-level visualization intents and low-level data transformation steps, leveraging an AI agent. We realize this paradigm in Data Formulator, an interactive visualization authoring tool. With Data Formulator, authors first define data concepts they plan to visualize using natural languages or examples, and then bind them to visual channels. Data Formulator then dispatches its AI-agent to automatically transform the input data to surface these concepts and generate desired visualizations. When presenting the results (transformed table and output visualizations) from the AI agent, Data Formulator provides feedback to help authors inspect and understand them. A user study with 10 participants shows that participants could learn and use Data Formulator to create visualizations that involve challenging data transformations, and presents interesting future research directions.","article_number":"10292609","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10292609","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292609/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292609/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"1128","end_page":"1138","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":319,"insert_date":"20231023","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Temperature distribution","Urban areas","Visualization","Transforms","Histograms","Libraries"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["AI","visualization authoring","data transformation","programming by example","natural language","large language model"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive","Paradigm Shift","New Paradigm","Natural Language","Data Transformation","Visualization Tool","Visual Channels","Ambiguity","Scatter Plot","Temperature Difference","Column Temperature","Daily Temperature","Language Model","Visual Space","Type Of Transformation","Tidyverse","Code Generation","Line Chart","Visual Exploration","Conversational Agents","Visual Encoding","Primitive Element","Natural Language Descriptions","Chart Types","Multiple Columns"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327385","title":"Affective Visualization Design: Leveraging the Emotional Impact of Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":122,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Fudan University, Research Group of Computational and AI Communication at Institute for Global Communications and Integrated Media, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088861952","id":37088861952,"full_name":"Xingyu Lan","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fudan University, Research Group of Computational and AI Communication at Institute for Global Communications and Integrated Media, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089205448","id":37089205448,"full_name":"Yanqiu Wu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604309600","id":37604309600,"full_name":"Nan Cao","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In recent years, more and more researchers have reflected on the undervaluation of emotion in data visualization and highlighted the importance of considering human emotion in visualization design. Meanwhile, an increasing number of studies have been conducted to explore emotion-related factors. However, so far, this research area is still in its early stages and faces a set of challenges, such as the unclear definition of key concepts, the insufficient justification of why emotion is important in visualization design, and the lack of characterization of the design space of affective visualization design. To address these challenges, first, we conducted a literature review and identified three research lines that examined both emotion and data visualization. We clarified the differences between these research lines and kept 109 papers that studied or discussed how data visualization communicates and influences emotion. Then, we coded the 109 papers in terms of how they justified the legitimacy of considering emotion in visualization design (i.e., why emotion is important) and identified five argumentative perspectives. Based on these papers, we also identified 61 projects that practiced affective visualization design. We coded these design projects in three dimensions, including design fields (where), design tasks (what), and design methods (how), to explore the design space of affective visualization design.","article_number":"10301796","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10301796","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10301796/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10301796/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"1","end_page":"11","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":848,"insert_date":"20231030","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Image color analysis","Task analysis","Systematics","Faces","Visual analytics","Space exploration"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Information Visualization","Affective Design","Visual Communication","User Experience","Storytelling"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Design","Data Visualization","Design Method","Task Design","Identification Task","Design Space","Project Design","Narrative","Socialization","Gregarious","Empathy","Empathic","Empathetic","Web Of Science","3D Printing","Subjective Experience","Interfacial Interaction","Design Techniques","Anthropomorphic","Sociological Perspective","Social Imaginaries","Sociological Approach","Social Visibility","Application Perspective","Immersive Environment","Good Visualization","Thread Of Research","Thread Of Inquiry","Inquiry Threads","Emotional Mechanisms","Categories Of Techniques","Tower Of London","River Pollution","Map Design","Cartographic Design","Visual System","Sexual Harassment","Practical Design","Conventional Concept"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327353","title":"TransforLearn: Interactive Visual Tutorial for the Transformer Model","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":123,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Data Science, Fudan University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/276474811343188","id":276474811343188,"full_name":"Lin Gao","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Data Science, Fudan University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Data Science, Fudan University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/270083074846256","id":270083074846256,"full_name":"Zekai Shao","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Data Science, Fudan University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Data Science, Fudan University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/364208914060631","id":364208914060631,"full_name":"Ziqin Luo","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Data Science, Fudan University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Chongqing University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086007262","id":37086007262,"full_name":"Haibo Hu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Chongqing University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Warwick, United Kingdom","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37567685600","id":37567685600,"full_name":"Cagatay Turkay","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Warwick, United Kingdom"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Data Science, Fudan University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085387892","id":37085387892,"full_name":"Siming Chen","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Data Science, Fudan University, China","Shanghai Key Laboratory of Data Science, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The widespread adoption of Transformers in deep learning, serving as the core framework for numerous large-scale language models, has sparked significant interest in understanding their underlying mechanisms.

However, it is challenging for data journalists to discover graph data facts and manually organize correlated facts around a meaningful topic due to the complexity of graph data and the difficulty to interpret graph narratives. Therefore, we present an automatic graph facts generation system, Calliope-Net, which consists of a fact discovery module, a fact organization module, and a visualization module. It creates annotated node-link diagrams with facts automatically discovered and organized from network data. A novel layout algorithm is designed to present meaningful and visually appealing annotated graphs. We evaluate the proposed system with two case studies and an in-lab user study. The results show that Calliope-Net can benefit users in discovering and understanding graph data facts with visually pleasing annotated visualizations.","article_number":"10295417","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10295417","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10295417/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10295417/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"562","end_page":"572","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":280,"insert_date":"20231024","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Annotations","Data mining","Visualization","Organizations","Layout","Interviews"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Graph Data","Application Motivated Visualization","Automatic Visualization","Narrative Visualization","Authoring Tools"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Graph Data","Automatic Generation","Node-link Diagram","Data Mining","User Study","Visual Modality","Data Journalism","Diary Data","Data-driven Journalism","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Objective Function","Data Elements","Factors Of Interest","Multidimensional Data","Multidimensional Analysis","Topological Features","Topological Characteristics","Degree Centrality","Visibility Graph","Design Goals","Prototype System","Co-occurrence Network","Logical Relationship","Graph Layout","Graph Drawing","Categorical Attributes","Classification Properties","Attribute Classification","Meaningful Themes","Meaningful Topics","Node Attributes","Nodal Properties","Stack Overflow","Influential Nodes","Eigenvector Centrality","Text Annotation","Partitioning Algorithm","Gray Nodes"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327192","title":"My Model is Unfair, Do People Even Care?

As a consequence, disparate stakeholders need to interact with and make informed decisions about using machine learning models in everyday systems. Visualization technology can support stakeholders in understanding and evaluating trade-offs between, for example, accuracy and fairness of models. This paper aims to empirically answer “Can visualization design choices affect a stakeholder's perception of model bias, trust in a model, and willingness to adopt a model?” Through a series of controlled, crowd-sourced experiments with more than 1,500 participants, we identify a set of strategies people follow in deciding which models to trust. Our results show that men and women prioritize fairness and performance differently and that visual design choices significantly affect that prioritization. For example, women trust fairer models more often than men do, participants value fairness more when it is explained using text than as a bar chart, and being explicitly told a model is biased has a bigger impact than showing past biased performance. We test the generalizability of our results by comparing the effect of multiple textual and visual design choices and offer potential explanations of the cognitive mechanisms behind the difference in fairness perception and trust. Our research guides design considerations to support future work developing visualization systems for machine learning.","article_number":"10296507","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10296507","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10296507/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10296507/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"327","end_page":"337","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":285,"insert_date":"20231025","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Computational modeling","Analytical models","Data models","Bars","Investment","Games"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["machine learning","fairness","bias","trust","visual design","gender","human-subjects studies"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Machine Learning","Machine Learning Models","Visual System","Bar Charts","Model Bias","Perceptual Bias","Visual Design","Perceptions Of Fairness","Trust Model","Fair Model","Model Performance","Gender Differences","Rate Of Return","Return On Investment","Visual Representation","Higher Returns","Higher Payoff","Participant Gender","Textual Descriptions","Average Return","Average Payoff","Issue Of Differences","Differences In Returns","Payoff Difference","Pair Of Models","Cognitive Reflection Test","Trust Game","Behavioral Inhibition System","Behavioral Activation System","Trust In People","Attention Checks","Second-order Interactions","Algorithmic Bias","Algorithmic Discrimination","Face Recognition Bias","Behavior Of Men","Text Annotation","Text Representation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326923","title":"Visualizing Historical Book Trade Data: An Iterative Design Study with Close Collaboration with Domain Experts","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":126,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"King's College London, United Kingdom","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089822646","id":37089822646,"full_name":"Yiwen Xing","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["King's College London, United Kingdom"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Oxford, United Kingdom","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/669546987493997","id":669546987493997,"full_name":"Cristina Dondi","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Oxford, United Kingdom"]}},{"affiliation":"King's College London, United Kingdom","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591074800","id":37591074800,"full_name":"Rita Borgo","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["King's College London, United Kingdom"]}},{"affiliation":"King's College London, United Kingdom","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489317800","id":38489317800,"full_name":"Alfie Abdul-Rahman","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["King's College London, United Kingdom"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The circulation of historical books has always been an area of interest for historians.

However, designing interactive physicalizations is challenging as it requires cross-disciplinary knowledge in visualization, fabrication, and electronics. Interactive physicalizations are typically produced in an unstructured manner, resulting in unique solutions for a specific dataset, problem, or interaction that cannot be easily extended or adapted to new scenarios or future physicalizations. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce a computational design pipeline to 3D print network physicalizations with integrated sensing capabilities. Networks are ubiquitous, yet their complex geometry also requires significant engineering considerations to provide intuitive, effective interactions for exploration. Using our pipeline, designers can readily produce network physicalizations supporting selection—the most critical atomic operation for interaction—by touch through capacitive sensing and computational inference. Our computational design pipeline introduces a new design paradigm by concurrently considering the form and interactivity of a physicalization into one cohesive fabrication workflow. We evaluate our approach using (i) computational evaluations, (ii) three usage scenarios focusing on general visualization tasks, and (iii) expert interviews. The design paradigm introduced by our pipeline can lower barriers to physicalization research, creation, and adoption.","article_number":"10303764","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10303764","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10303764/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10303764/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"913","end_page":"923","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":261,"insert_date":"20231031","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Sensors","Pipelines","Fabrication","Three-dimensional displays","Data visualization","Three-dimensional printing","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Physicalization","tangible interfaces","3D printing","computational fabrication","design automation","network data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Computational Pipeline","Physicalism","3D Printing","Capacitive Sensor","Usage Scenarios","Design Paradigm","Computational Inference","Time Delay","Physical Interaction","Minimal Differences","Minimum Deviation","Time Complexity","Printed Circuit Board","Electrical Circuit","Betweenness Centrality","Interaction Design","Circuit Simulation","Depth-first","Depth First Search","Network Datasets","Node Selection","Resistance Network","Network Layout","Conductive Filaments","Multi-material Printing","Arduino UNO","Symbolic Processing","Symbolic Computation","Symbolic Math","Procrustes Distance","Synthetic Networks","Virtual Objects","Digital Twin","Electronic Components"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326939","title":"Roses Have Thorns: Understanding the Downside of Oncological Care Delivery Through Visual Analytics and Sequential Rule Mining","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":128,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Illinois Chicago, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089183519","id":37089183519,"full_name":"Carla Floricel","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Illinois Chicago, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Illinois Chicago, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100729","id":37087100729,"full_name":"Andrew Wentzel","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Illinois Chicago, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"M.D. Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086696885","id":37086696885,"full_name":"Abdallah Mohamed","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["M.D. Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"M.D. Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085431902","id":37085431902,"full_name":"C.David Fuller","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["M.D. Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Iowa, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37936571200","id":37936571200,"full_name":"Guadalupe Canahuate","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Iowa, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Illinois Chicago, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37937697100","id":37937697100,"full_name":"G.Elisabeta Marai","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Illinois Chicago, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Personalized head and neck cancer therapeutics have greatly improved survival rates for patients, but are often leading to understudied long-lasting symptoms which affect quality of life. Sequential rule mining (SRM) is a promising unsupervised machine learning method for predicting longitudinal patterns in temporal data which, however, can output many repetitive patterns that are difficult to interpret without the assistance of visual analytics. We present a data-driven, human-machine analysis visual system developed in collaboration with SRM model builders in cancer symptom research, which facilitates mechanistic knowledge discovery in large scale, multivariate cohort symptom data. Our system supports multivariate predictive modeling of post-treatment symptoms based on during-treatment symptoms. It supports this goal through an SRM, clustering, and aggregation back end, and a custom front end to help develop and tune the predictive models. The system also explains the resulting predictions in the context of therapeutic decisions typical in personalized care delivery. We evaluate the resulting models and system with an interdisciplinary group of modelers and head and neck oncology researchers. The results demonstrate that our system effectively supports clinical and symptom research.","article_number":"10330756","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10330756","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10330756/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10330756/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"1227","end_page":"1237","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":158,"insert_date":"20231128","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Cancer","Computational modeling","Data visualization","Data mining","Analytical models","Data models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Temporal Data","Life Sciences","Mixed Initiative Human-Machine Analysis","Data Clustering and Aggregation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Sequencing Rules","Visual System","Model Building","Unsupervised Learning","Unsupervised Classification","Unsupervised Machine Learning","Unsupervised Approach","Head And Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma","Head And Neck Cancer","Unsupervised Methods","Temporal Data","Cancer Symptoms","Longitudinal Patterns","Unsupervised Machine Learning Methods","Cohort Of Patients","Patient Data","Spatial Patterns","Spatiotemporal Patterns","Temporal Patterns","Treatment Modalities","Tumor Stage","Temporal Dimension","Time Dimension","Temporal Properties","Domain Experts","Acute Stage","Symptom Burden","Late Symptoms","Symptom Clusters","Late Toxicity","Node Stage","Lymph Node Staging","Symptom Patterns","Categorical Attributes","Classification Properties","Attribute Classification","Acute Time Points","Temporal Clustering","Sankey Diagram","Sankey Plot","Sequential Pattern Mining","Itemset Mining","Sequence Mining"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326603","title":"Extract and Characterize Hairpin Vortices in Turbulent Flows","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":129,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Houston, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37393570100","id":37393570100,"full_name":"Adeel Zafar","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Houston, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Houston, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/372066815391242","id":372066815391242,"full_name":"Di Yang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Houston, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Houston, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37069800000","id":37069800000,"full_name":"Guoning Chen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Houston, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Hairpin vortices are one of the most important vortical structures in turbulent flows.

Our method first extracts general vortical regions with a region-growing strategy based on certain vortex criteria (e.g., $\\lambda_{2}$) and then separates those vortices with the help of progressive extraction of ($\\lambda_{2}$) iso-surfaces in a top-down fashion. This leads to a hierarchical tree representing the spatial proximity and merging relation of vortices. After separating individual vortices, their shape and orientation information is extracted. Candidate hairpin vortices are identified based on their shape and orientation information as well as their physical characteristics. An interactive visualization system is developed to aid the exploration, classification, and analysis of hairpin vortices based on their geometric and physical attributes.

At the heart of this revolutionary technology are quantum circuits, which serve as vital tools for implementing, analyzing, and optimizing quantum algorithms. Recent advancements in quantum computing and the increasing capability of quantum devices have led to the development of more complex quantum circuits. However, traditional quantum circuit diagrams suffer from scalability and readability issues, which limit the efficiency of analysis and optimization processes. In this research, we propose a novel visualization approach for large-scale quantum circuits by adopting semantic analysis to facilitate the comprehension of quantum circuits. We first exploit meta-data and semantic information extracted from the underlying code of quantum circuits to create component segmentations and pattern abstractions, allowing for easier wrangling of massive circuit diagrams. We then develop Quantivine, an interactive system for exploring and understanding quantum circuits. A series of novel circuit visualizations is designed to uncover contextual details such as qubit provenance, parallelism, and entanglement. The effectiveness of Quantivine is demonstrated through two usage scenarios of quantum circuits with up to 100 qubits and a formal user evaluation with quantum experts.

However, designing a good color palette for a chart is a challenging task for novice users who lack related design expertise. For example, they often find it difficult to articulate their abstract intentions and translate these intentions into effective editing actions to achieve a desired outcome. In this work, we present NL2Color, a tool that allows novice users to refine chart color palettes using natural language expressions of their desired outcomes. We first collected and categorized a dataset of 131 triplets, each consisting of an original color palette of a chart, an editing intent, and a new color palette designed by human experts according to the intent. Our tool employs a large language model (LLM) to substitute the colors in original palettes and produce new color palettes by selecting some of the triplets as few-shot prompts. To evaluate our tool, we conducted a comprehensive two-stage evaluation, including a crowd-sourcing study ($\\mathrm{N}=71$) and a within-subjects user study ($\\mathrm{N}=12$). The results indicate that the quality of the color palettes revised by NL2Color has no significantly large difference from those designed by human experts. The participants who used NL2Color obtained revised color palettes to their satisfaction in a shorter period and with less effort.","article_number":"10292693","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10292693","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292693/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292693/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":10373160,"publication_year":2024,"publication_date":"Jan. 2024","start_page":"814","end_page":"824","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":486,"insert_date":"20231023","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image color analysis","Color","Natural languages","Data visualization","Task analysis","Refining","Bars"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["chart","color palette","natural language","large language model"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Natural Language","Color Palette","User Study","Human Experts","Original Color","Within-subject Study","Control Condition","Cognitive Load","Cognitive Demands","Mental Workload","Mental Effort","Qualitative Results","Failure Cases","User Preferences","User Input","Debugging","Color Scheme","Original Ones","Usage Intention","Color Coordinates","User Requests","Usage Scenarios","Few-shot Learning","Primary Colors","Task Completion Time","Types Of Requests","User Confidence","NASA Task Load Index","Color Categories","Color Classification","Signed-rank Test","Wilcoxon Signed-rank Test","Wilcoxon Test","Unique Color","Original Module"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326051","title":"Welcome","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":134,"volume":"30","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Monash University, Australia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37326161000","id":37326161000,"full_name":"Tim Dwyer","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University, Australia"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University, Australia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077419200","id":37077419200,"full_name":"Sarah Goodwin","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University, Australia"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University, Australia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37867777700","id":37867777700,"full_name":"Michael Wybrow","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University, Australia"]}}]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We are thrilled this year to welcome the IEEE VIS conference for its first ever visit to Australia.

We pay our respects to their Elders past, present and emerging. We know Melbourne (Narrm) is a long way from Europe and the US, as we've been doing the reverse trip ourselves for many years. But we are grateful to all from those regions who are able to join us, and we are delighted to welcome many new participants from the Asia-Pacific region who are now able to attend in-person for the first time.
