EQSA is designed to support users to characterize the condition across the area around the earthquake zone, regarding related events, resources to be allocated, and responses from the community. On the general level, changes in the volume of messages from chosen categories are presented, assisting users in conveying a general idea of the condition. More in-depth analysis is provided with topic evolution, community visualization, and location representation. EQSA is developed with intuitive, interactive features and multiple linked views, visualizing social media data, and supporting users to gain a comprehensive insight into the situation.

We propose cpmViz, a web-based tool that allows for interactive data exploration of the sensor readings in both of the spatial and temporal dimensions. The tool consists out of three views that are connected via linking and scrolling. We visualize static sensor uncertainty by introducing Voronoi cells to illustrate how much space is covered by an individual measurement unit. For mobile sensors, we showcase their activity periods and introduce the concept of sensor streaks as periods of uninterrupted recordings as a temporal uncertainty measure. As for spatial uncertainty, we color individual districts based on the amount of data that was recorded inside the user's selected time window. Using our system, we were able to easily spot major events like the city's initial earthquake in the sensor readings. Certain southern districts are clearly visible as areas of concern that we consider in need of more static sensors.

They use explicit quantities, standard metrics, and unambiguous visual elements to create clear, concise, legible messages. The terms on which visualizations are assessed tends to value these properties-and to be premised on the idea that the best graphics are those that “show the data”-as if data had inherent form. The difficulty with this entire set of assumptions is that they do not establish foundations for visualizing complex historical events, narrative discourse, or human experience as it is expressed in documents and artifacts where “data” are not self-evident or standard. The humanities, in adopting visualizations from empirically based fields, has failed to develop methods that engage with the interpretative aspects of its own discourse. Using three case studies-one from news narratives, one from mixed historical chronologies, one from imagined crisis scenarios-this paper argues for the development of visualizations capable of showing variable timescales, comparative chronology, and partial and unfolding temporalities. The basic components of these systems are non-linear, affective, and unable to be standardized in ways that trouble empirical approaches but serve interpretative understandings of experience and its representation in cultural expressions. The questions of how such systems might be designed and where they might have useful applications will be raised to generate discussion.","article_number":"8986953","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8986953","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986953/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986953/","publication_title":"2019 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","conference_dates":"20-25 Oct. 2019","publication_number":8966971,"is_number":8986897,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"20-25 Oct. 2019","start_page":"1","end_page":"1","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":103,"insert_date":"20200210","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Art","Data visualization","Visualization","Standards","Presses","Social sciences","Production"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2285-4","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2284-7","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST47406.2019.8986916","title":"Earthquake Damage Report Interactive Dashboard Using Bayesian Structural Time Series and Value-Suppressing Uncertainty Palettes","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-7281-2285-4","rank":12,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Division of Bioinformatics and Data Management for Research, Development and Promotion of Science and Technology Talents Project, Institute for the Promotion of Teaching Science and Technology, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087500397","id":37087500397,"full_name":"Natthawut Adulyanukosol","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Division of Bioinformatics and Data Management for Research, Development and Promotion of Science and Technology Talents Project, Institute for the Promotion of Teaching Science and Technology, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Earthquake Damage Report Interactive Dashboard addresses Mini Challenge 1 of VAST Challenge 2019.

Despite the benefits algorithmic systems may bring, models can reflect, inject, or exacerbate implicit and explicit societal biases into their outputs, disadvantaging certain demographic subgroups. Discovering which biases a machine learning model has introduced is a great challenge, due to the numerous definitions of fairness and the large number of potentially impacted subgroups. We present FAIRVIS, a mixed-initiative visual analytics system that integrates a novel subgroup discovery technique for users to audit the fairness of machine learning models. Through FAIRVIS, users can apply domain knowledge to generate and investigate known subgroups, and explore suggested and similar subgroups. FAIRVIS's coordinated views enable users to explore a high-level overview of subgroup performance and subsequently drill down into detailed investigation of specific subgroups. We show how FAIRVIS helps to discover biases in two real datasets used in predicting income and recidivism. As a visual analytics system devoted to discovering bias in machine learning, FAIRVIS demonstrates how interactive visualization may help data scientists and the general public understand and create more equitable algorithmic systems.","article_number":"8986948","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8986948","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986948/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986948/","publication_title":"2019 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","conference_dates":"20-25 Oct. 2019","publication_number":8966971,"is_number":8986897,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"20-25 Oct. 2019","start_page":"46","end_page":"56","citing_paper_count":86,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1863,"insert_date":"20200210","index_terms":{"author_terms":{"terms":["Machine learning fairness","visual analytics","intersectional bias","subgroup discovery"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Machine Learning","Machine-learning","Learning Bias","Learning Biases","Algorithmic Bias","Algorithmic Discrimination","Face Recognition Bias","Algorithmic Biases","Cognitive Domains","Domain Knowledge","Machine Learning Models","Visual System","Distribution Characteristics","Feature Distribution","False Positive Rate","False-positive Rate","Feature Values","Characteristic Values","Performance Metrics","Basal Rate","Demographic Groups","Detailed View","Visualization Techniques","Dominant Feature","Dominant Characteristics","Similar Views","Split-plot","Split-plot Design","Design Goals","Subgroup Comparisons","Dominant Values","Jensen-Shannon Divergence","Jensen Shannon Divergence","Male Subgroups","Important Subgroup","African American Males","African-American Male","Visual Interface","Subspace Clustering","Values In The Dataset","Disparities In Performance","Statistical Distance","Ground Truth Labels"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2285-4","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2284-7","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST47406.2019.8986943","title":"Interactive Correction of Mislabeled Training Data","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-7281-2285-4","rank":27,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087500773","id":37087500773,"full_name":"Shouxing Xiang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087499275","id":37087499275,"full_name":"Xi Ye","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37531405500","id":37531405500,"full_name":"Jiazhi Xia","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Informatics, Cardiff University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086225533","id":37086225533,"full_name":"Jing Wu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Informatics, Cardiff University"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087502906","id":37087502906,"full_name":"Yang Chen","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406039100","id":37406039100,"full_name":"Shixia Liu","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"In this paper, we develop a visual analysis method for interactively improving the quality of labeled data, which is essential to the success of supervised and semi-supervised learning.

The gulf between user expectations and system capabilities may lead to a disappointing user experience. So - if we want to engineer a natural language system, what are the requirements around system intelligence? This work takes a retrospective look at how we answered this question in the design of Ask Data, a natural language interaction feature for Tableau. We examine two factors contributing to perceived system intelligence: the system's ability to understand the analytic intent behind an input utterance and the ability to interpret an utterance contextually (i.e. taking into account the current visualization state and recent actions). Our aim was to understand the ways in which a system would need to support these two aspects of intelligence to enable a positive user experience. We first describe a pre-design Wizard of Oz study that offered insight into this question and narrowed the space of designs under consideration. We then reflect on the impact of this study on system development, examining how design implications from the study played out in practice. Our work contributes insights for the design of natural language interaction in visual analytics as well as a reflection on the value of pre-design empirical studies in the development of visual analytic systems.","article_number":"8986918","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8986918","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986918/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986918/","publication_title":"2019 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","conference_dates":"20-25 Oct. 2019","publication_number":8966971,"is_number":8986897,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"20-25 Oct. 2019","start_page":"93","end_page":"103","citing_paper_count":18,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":657,"insert_date":"20200210","index_terms":{"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Empirical studies in visualization","Human-centered computing","Interaction paradigms","Natural language interfaces"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Intelligence","Analysis System","Natural Language","Visual System","User Experience","Visual Analysis","Ability Of System","Question Design","Interactive","Semantic","Numeric","Intelligent Systems","Flow Analysis","Design Choices","Bar Charts","Understanding Of Use","Understanding Of Users","Usage Intention","Linguistic Context","Visual Encoding","User Goals","Information Retrieval Systems","Repair Actions","Confidence In The System","Proactive Behavior","Proactive Behaviour","Prior Step","Age Bins","Chart Types","Rational Design","Design Principles"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2285-4","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2284-7","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST47406.2019.8986909","title":"Origraph: Interactive Network Wrangling","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-7281-2285-4","rank":29,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085905494","id":37085905494,"full_name":"Alex Bigelow","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399400500","id":37399400500,"full_name":"Carolina Nobre","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564728700","id":37564728700,"full_name":"Miriah Meyer","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37395933400","id":37395933400,"full_name":"Alexander Lex","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Utah"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Networks are a natural way of thinking about many datasets. The data on which a network is based, however, is rarely collected in a form that suits the analysis process, making it necessary to create and reshape networks. Data wrangling is widely acknowledged to be a critical part of the data analysis pipeline, yet interactive network wrangling has received little attention in the visualization research community. In this paper, we discuss a set of operations that are important for wrangling network datasets and introduce a visual data wrangling tool, Origraph, that enables analysts to apply these operations to their datasets. Key operations include creating a network from source data such as tables, reshaping a network by introducing new node or edge classes, filtering nodes or edges, and deriving new node or edge attributes. Our tool, Origraph, enables analysts to execute these operations with little to no programming, and to immediately visualize the results. Origraph provides views to investigate the network model, a sample of the network, and node and edge attributes. In addition, we introduce interfaces designed to aid analysts in specifying arguments for sensible network wrangling operations. We demonstrate the usefulness of Origraph in two Use Cases: first, we investigate gender bias in the film industry, and then the influence of money on the political support for the war in Yemen.","article_number":"8986909","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8986909","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986909/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986909/","publication_title":"2019 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","conference_dates":"20-25 Oct. 2019","publication_number":8966971,"is_number":8986897,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"20-25 Oct. 2019","start_page":"81","end_page":"92","citing_paper_count":14,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":432,"insert_date":"20200210","index_terms":{"author_terms":{"terms":["Graph visualization","Data abstraction","Data wrangling","Human-centered computing [Information visualization]","[Human-centered computing]: Visualization systems and tools","Information systems [Graph-based database models]"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive","Network Model","Film Industry","Movie Industry","Node Attributes","Nodal Properties","Network Sampling","Network Datasets","Network Data Sets","Edge Attributes","Edge Properties","Heuristic","Rule Of Thumb","Raw Files","Network Topology","Visual Network","Network Diagram","Network State","Network Conditions","Network Status","Data Abstraction","Actor Network","Actor-network","Actor-network Theory","Actor Network Theory","Mental Models","Production Companies","Multiple Edges","Multi-edge","Parallel Edges","Single Edge","List Of Attributes","List Of Properties","Scripting Language","Conflicting Interests","Graph Database","Thousands Of Nodes","US Senate","United States Senate","Cast Members","Popular Movies","Runtime Complexity","Donation","Charitable","Visual Interface"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2285-4","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2284-7","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST47406.2019.8986934","title":"Influence Flowers of Academic Entities","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-7281-2285-4","rank":30,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Australian National University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087501230","id":37087501230,"full_name":"Minjeong Shin","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Australian National University"]}},{"affiliation":"Australian National University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087499975","id":37087499975,"full_name":"Alexander Soen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Australian National University"]}},{"affiliation":"Australian National University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087498684","id":37087498684,"full_name":"Benjamin T.

The petals are styled to reflect the strength of influence to and from other entities of the same or different type. For example, one can break down the incoming and outgoing influences of a research lab by research topics. The Influence Flower uses a recent snapshot of Microsoft Academic Graph, consisting of 212 million authors, their 176 million publications, and 1.2 billion citations. An interactive web app, Influence Map, is constructed around this central metaphor for searching and curating visualisations. We also propose a visual comparison method that highlights change in influence patterns over time. We demonstrate through several case studies that the Influence Flower supports data-driven inquiries about the following: researchers' careers over time; paper(s) and projects, including those with delayed recognition; the interdisciplinary profile of a research institution; and the shifting topical trends in conferences. We also use this tool on influence data beyond academic citations, by contrasting the academic and Twitter activities of a researcher.","article_number":"8986934","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8986934","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986934/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986934/","publication_title":"2019 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","conference_dates":"20-25 Oct. 2019","publication_number":8966971,"is_number":8986897,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"20-25 Oct. 2019","start_page":"1","end_page":"10","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":429,"insert_date":"20200210","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Collaboration","Market research","Tools","Engineering profession","Search engines"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Human-centered computing","Visualization","Visualisation application domains","Visual analytics","Visualization systems and tools","Empirical studies in visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Academic Entities","Twitter","Retweets","Influence Of Strength","Trending Topics","Visual Metaphors","Machine Learning","Machine-learning","Computer Science","Number Of Papers","Gynecology And Obstetrics","Hilaris","Biology And Medicine","Polymer Science","Malaria Control And Elimination","Node Size","Number Of Citations","Social Media Data","Social Media Analytics","Collection Of Papers","Document Collection","World Wide Web","Red Edge","Citation Counts","Citation Impact","Citation Metrics","Entity Types","Node Color","Node Colour","Public Venues","Blue Edges","Sleeping Beauty","Co-authorship Network","Flower Petals","Ego Network","Altmetric","Caching","Social Media","Social Platforms","Google Scholar","Maximum Size"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2285-4","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2284-7","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST47406.2019.8986940","title":"FDive: Learning Relevance Models Using Pattern-based Similarity Measures","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-7281-2285-4","rank":31,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087126923","id":37087126923,"full_name":"Frederik L.

Therefore, analysts require automated support for the extraction of relevant patterns. In this paper, we present FDive, a visual active learning system that helps to create visually explorable relevance models, assisted by learning a pattern-based similarity. We use a small set of user-provided labels to rank similarity measures, consisting of feature descriptor and distance function combinations, by their ability to distinguish relevant from irrelevant data. Based on the best-ranked similarity measure, the system calculates an interactive Self-Organizing Map-based relevance model, which classifies data according to the cluster affiliation. It also automatically prompts further relevance feedback to improve its accuracy. Uncertain areas, especially near the decision boundaries, are highlighted and can be refined by the user. We evaluate our approach by comparison to state-of-the-art feature selection techniques and demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by a case study classifying electron microscopy images of brain cells. The results show that FDive enhances both the quality and understanding of relevance models and can thus lead to new insights for brain research.","article_number":"8986940","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8986940","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986940/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986940/","publication_title":"2019 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","conference_dates":"20-25 Oct. 2019","publication_number":8966971,"is_number":8986897,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"20-25 Oct. 2019","start_page":"69","end_page":"80","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":273,"insert_date":"20200210","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data models","Visualization","Adaptation models","Task analysis","Feature extraction","Analytical models","Self-organizing feature maps"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","similarity measure selection","relevance feedback","active learning","self-organizing maps"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Similarity Measure","Similarity Metrics","Relevant Model","Electron Microscopy Images","Active Learning","Descriptive Characteristics","Feature Descriptors","Distance Function","Model Quality","Decision Boundary","Understanding Of Models","High-dimensional Datasets","High-dimensional Data Sets","Visual Learning","Feature Selection Techniques","Microscopy Images Of Cells","Relevant Feedback","Irrelevant Data","Classification Model","Learning Process","Support Vector Machine","Scatter Plot","Decision Tree","Self-organizing Map","Kohonen","Irrelevant Items","Areas Of Uncertainty","Feature Space","Quality Metrics","Data Space","Number Of Labels","Iterative Framework","Feature Selection Algorithm","Vector Space"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2285-4","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2284-7","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST47406.2019.8986917","title":"VIANA: Visual Interactive Annotation of Argumentation","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-7281-2285-4","rank":32,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086245203","id":37086245203,"full_name":"Fabian Sperrle","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086240969","id":37086240969,"full_name":"Rita Sevastjanova","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101535","id":37087101535,"full_name":"Rebecca Kehlbeck","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086235941","id":37086235941,"full_name":"Mennatallah El-Assady","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Argumentation Mining addresses the challenging tasks of identifying boundaries of argumentative text fragments and extracting their relationships. Fully automated solutions do not reach satisfactory accuracy due to their insufficient incorporation of semantics and domain knowledge. Therefore, experts currently rely on time-consuming manual annotations. In this paper, we present a visual analytics system that augments the manual annotation process by automatically suggesting which text fragments to annotate next. The accuracy of those suggestions is improved over time by incorporating linguistic knowledge and language modeling to learn a measure of argument similarity from user interactions. Based on a long-term collaboration with domain experts, we identify and model five high-level analysis tasks. We enable close reading and note-taking, annotation of arguments, argument reconstruction, extraction of argument relations, and exploration of argument graphs. To avoid context switches, we transition between all views through seamless morphing, visually anchoring all text- and graph-based layers. We evaluate our system with a two-stage expert user study based on a corpus of presidential debates. The results show that experts prefer our system over existing solutions due to the speedup provided by the automatic suggestions and the tight integration between text and graph views.","article_number":"8986917","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8986917","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986917/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986917/","publication_title":"2019 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","conference_dates":"20-25 Oct. 2019","publication_number":8966971,"is_number":8986897,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"20-25 Oct. 2019","start_page":"11","end_page":"22","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":394,"insert_date":"20200210","index_terms":{"author_terms":{"terms":["Argumentation annotation","machine learning","user interaction","layered interfaces","semantic transitions"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive","User Study","Visual Analysis","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Domain Experts","Language Model","Manual Annotation","Manual Process","Annotation Process","Expert Users","Text Fragments","Long-term Collaboration","System Design","Phase Of The Study","Visual Representation","Donald Trump","Mental Models","Word Embedding","Word Vectors","Recommender Systems","Study Sessions","Text Annotation","Computational Linguistics","Annotation System","Progressive Learning","Temporal Decay","Linguistic Theory","Theoretical Linguistics","Argument Structure","Map For Each Subject","Topic Maps","Maps Of Subjects","Scrolling","Implicit Feedback"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2285-4","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2284-7","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST47406.2019.8986922","title":"TopicSifter: Interactive Search Space Reduction through Targeted Topic Modeling","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-7281-2285-4","rank":33,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085351744","id":37085351744,"full_name":"Hannah Kim","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088523715","id":37088523715,"full_name":"Dongjin Choi","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Tech Research Institute","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37845636600","id":37845636600,"full_name":"Barry Drake","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Tech Research Institute"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681759500","id":37681759500,"full_name":"Alex Endert","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37277119500","id":37277119500,"full_name":"Haesun Park","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Topic modeling is commonly used to analyze and understand large document collections. However, in practice, users want to focus on specific aspects or “targets” rather than the entire corpus. For example, given a large collection of documents, users may want only a smaller subset which more closely aligns with their interests, tasks, and domains. In particular, our paper focuses on large-scale document retrieval with high recall where any missed relevant documents can be critical. A simple keyword matching search is generally not effective nor efficient as 1) it is difficult to find a list of keyword queries that can cover the documents of interest before exploring the dataset, 2) some documents may not contain the exact keywords of interest but may still be highly relevant, and 3) some words have multiple meanings, which would result in irrelevant documents included in the retrieved subset. In this paper, we present TopicSifter, a visual analytics system for interactive search space reduction. Our system utilizes targeted topic modeling based on nonnegative matrix factorization and allows users to give relevance feedback in order to refine their target and guide the topic modeling to the most relevant results.","article_number":"8986922","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8986922","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986922/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986922/","publication_title":"2019 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","conference_dates":"20-25 Oct. 2019","publication_number":8966971,"is_number":8986897,"publication_year":2019,"publication_date":"20-25 Oct. 2019","start_page":"35","end_page":"45","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":363,"insert_date":"20200210","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Computational modeling","Buildings","Visual analytics","Search problems","Negative feedback"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Human-centered computing","Visualization","Visualization application domains","Visual analytics","Information systems","Information retrieval","Users and interactive retrieval","Search interfaces"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Topic Modeling","Interaction Space","Reduced Search Space","Visual System","Positive Matrix","Multiple Meanings","High Recall","Non-negative Matrix Factorization","Collection Of Papers","Relevant Feedback","Topical","Positive Feedback","Negative Feedback","F1 Score","Information Retrieval","Mental Models","Previous Iteration","Word Embedding","Current Iteration","Main View","Relevance Score","List Of Keywords","Control Panel","User Feedback","Latent Dirichlet Allocation","Top Keywords","Dictionary Size","Raw Text","Word Pairs"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2285-4","isbnType":"New-2005"},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2284-7","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST47406.2019.8986923","title":"ICE: An Interactive Configuration Explorer for High Dimensional Categorical Parameter Spaces","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-7281-2285-4","rank":34,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087502080","id":37087502080,"full_name":"Anjul Tyagi","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087501577","id":37087501577,"full_name":"Zhen Cao","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087499598","id":37087499598,"full_name":"Tyler Estro","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37421767600","id":37421767600,"full_name":"Erez Zadok","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273119700","id":37273119700,"full_name":"Klaus Mueller","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"There are many applications where users seek to explore the impact of the settings of several categorical variables with respect to one dependent numerical variable. For example, a computer systems analyst might want to study how the type of file system or storage device affects system performance. A usual choice is the method of Parallel Sets designed to visualize multivariate categorical variables, However, we found that the magnitude of the parameter impacts on the numerical variable cannot be easily observed here. We also attempted a dimension reduction approach based on Multiple Correspondence Analysis but found that the SVD-generated 2D layout resulted in a loss of information. We hence propose a novel approach, the Interactive Configuration Explorer (ICE), which directly addresses the need of analysts to learn how the dependent numerical variable is affected by the parameter settings given multiple optimization objectives. No information is lost as ICE shows the complete distribution and statistics of the dependent variable in context with each categorical variable. Analysts can interactively filter the variables to optimize for certain goals such as achieving a system with maximum performance, low variance, etc. Our system was developed in tight collaboration with a group of systems performance researchers and its final effectiveness was evaluated with expert interviews, a comparative user study, and two case studies.","article_number":"8986923","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8986923","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986923/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986923/","publication_title":"2019
