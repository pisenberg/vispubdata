To address this challenge, we created the What-If Tool, an open-source application that allows practitioners to probe, visualize, and analyze ML systems, with minimal coding. The What-If Tool lets practitioners test performance in hypothetical situations, analyze the importance of different data features, and visualize model behavior across multiple models and subsets of input data. It also lets practitioners measure systems according to multiple ML fairness metrics. We describe the design of the tool, and report on real-life usage at different organizations.","article_number":"8807255","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8807255","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807255/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807255/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"56","end_page":"65","citing_paper_count":111,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":20752,"insert_date":"20190820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Tools","Data models","Data visualization","Analytical models","Predictive models","Machine learning","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Interactive Machine Learning","Model Debugging","Model Comparison"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Machine Learning","Machine-learning","Machine Learning Models","What-if Tool","WHAT IF Tool","Hypothetical","Subset Of Data","Machine Learning Systems","Wide Range Of Inputs","Model Performance","Performance Measures","Artificial Neural Network","Neural Network Model","False Positive Rate","False-positive Rate","Feature Values","Characteristic Values","Binary Classification","Performance Metrics","Feature Classification","Categorical Features","Confusion Matrix","Confusion Matrices","Graphical User Interface","Graphical Interface","Unique Value","Numerous Features","Numerical Features","Numerous Characteristics","Numerical Characteristics","Positive Class","Partial Dependence Plots","User Need","Capital Gains","Classification Threshold","Category Thresholds","Cost Ratio","Positive Threshold","Intersectional Analysis","Inference Results","Score Regression","Prediction Model"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934659","title":"Summit: Scaling Deep Learning Interpretability by Visualizing Activation and Attribution Summarizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":2,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Georgia Tech.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086235240","id":37086235240,"full_name":"Fred Hohman","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Tech."]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Tech.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087106137","id":37087106137,"full_name":"Haekyu Park","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Tech."]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Tech.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086161685","id":37086161685,"full_name":"Caleb Robinson","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Tech."]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Tech.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087104658","id":37087104658,"full_name":"Duen Horng Polo Chau","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Tech."]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Deep learning is increasingly used in decision-making tasks. However, understanding how neural networks produce final predictions remains a fundamental challenge. Existing work on interpreting neural network predictions for images often focuses on explaining predictions for single images or neurons. As predictions are often computed from millions of weights that are optimized over millions of images, such explanations can easily miss a bigger picture. We present Summit, an interactive system that scalably and systematically summarizes and visualizes what features a deep learning model has learned and how those features interact to make predictions. Summit introduces two new scalable summarization techniques: (1) activation aggregation discovers important neurons, and (2) neuron-influence aggregation identifies relationships among such neurons. Summit combines these techniques to create the novel attribution graph that reveals and summarizes crucial neuron associations and substructures that contribute to a model's outcomes. Summit scales to large data, such as the ImageNet dataset with 1.2M images, and leverages neural network feature visualization and dataset examples to help users distill large, complex neural network models into compact, interactive visualizations. We present neural network exploration scenarios where Summit helps us discover multiple surprising insights into a prevalent, large-scale image classifier's learned representations and informs future neural network architecture design. The Summit visualization runs in modern web browsers and is open-sourced.","article_number":"8807294","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8807294","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807294/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807294/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"1096","end_page":"1106","citing_paper_count":105,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2485,"insert_date":"20190820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Neurons","Biological neural networks","Feature extraction","Data visualization","Computational modeling","Predictive models","Visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Deep learning interpretability","visual analytics","scalable summarization","attribution graph"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Deep Learning","Neural Network","Complex Network","Artificial Neural Network","Neural Network Model","Image Classification","Deep Learning Models","Visual Features","Visual Characteristics","Interactive System","Representation Learning","Single Neuron","Interactive Visualization","Scaling Technique","Image Prediction","Modern Web Browser","Modern Browsers","Millions Of Images","Convolutional Neural Network","Convolutional Layers","Important Measure","Network Layer","Entire Network","Channel Layer","Entire Class","Top Channel","Mixed Layer","Mixing Height","Hierarchical Representation","Single Channel","Top Element","Bottom Element","Important Channel","Brown Bears","Ursus Arctos","Entire Graph"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934629","title":"explAIner: A Visual Analytics Framework for Interactive and Explainable Machine Learning","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":3,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101607","id":37087101607,"full_name":"Thilo Spinner","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086560746","id":37086560746,"full_name":"Udo Schlegel","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102286","id":37087102286,"full_name":"Hanna Schäfer","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086235941","id":37086235941,"full_name":"Mennatallah El-Assady","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We propose a framework for interactive and explainable machine learning that enables users to (1) understand machine learning models; (2) diagnose model limitations using different explainable AI methods; as well as (3) refine and optimize the models.

In this work, we investigate a Space-Time Cube in the Immersive Analytics domain. Based on a review of previous work and selecting an appropriate exploration metaphor, we built a prototype environment where the cube is coupled to a virtual representation of the analyst's real desk, and zooming and panning in space and time are intuitively controlled using mid-air gestures. We compared our immersive environment to a desktop-based implementation in a user study with 20 participants across 7 tasks of varying difficulty, which targeted different user interface features. To investigate how performance is affected in the presence of clutter, we explored two scenarios with different numbers of trajectories. While the quantitative performance was similar for the majority of tasks, large differences appear when we analyze the patterns of interaction and consider subjective metrics. The immersive version of the Space-Time Cube received higher usability scores, much higher user preference, and was rated to have a lower mental workload, without causing participants discomfort in 25-minute-long VR sessions.","article_number":"8854316","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8854316","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8854316/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8854316/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"514","end_page":"524","citing_paper_count":70,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1881,"insert_date":"20191001","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Task analysis","Trajectory","Three-dimensional displays","Data visualization","Clutter","Two dimensional displays","Visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Space-time cube","Trajectory visualization","Immersive analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Exploratory Data","Space-time Cube","Space–Time-Cube","Space Time Cube","Prototype","Metaphor","Cognitive Load","Cognitive Demands","Mental Workload","Mental Effort","User Study","Depth Perception","Depth Cues","Immersive Environment","Steep Learning Curve","Low Workload","Low Workloads","Trajectory Dataset","Trajectory Data Set","Interactive","Task Design","Identification Task","Visual Feedback","Video Feedback","Design Choices","Domain Experts","Different Points Of View","3D Representation","Base Map","Basemap","Relevant Tasks","User Performance","Immersive System","Simulator Sickness","Head-mounted Display","Urban Mobility","System Usability Scale","Stereopsis","Stereovision","Stereo Vision","Stereoscopic Vision","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Surface Mapping"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934398","title":"DataShot: Automatic Generation of Fact Sheets from Tabular Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":5,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086545328","id":37086545328,"full_name":"Yun Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102774","id":37087102774,"full_name":"Zhida Sun","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073639100","id":37073639100,"full_name":"Haidong Zhang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37391623900","id":37391623900,"full_name":"Weiwei Cui","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086887730","id":37086887730,"full_name":"Ke Xu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085504538","id":37085504538,"full_name":"Xiaojuan Ma","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37963085000","id":37963085000,"full_name":"Dongmei Zhang","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Fact sheets with vivid graphical design and intriguing statistical insights are prevalent for presenting raw data. They help audiences understand data-related facts effectively and make a deep impression. However, designing a fact sheet requires both data and design expertise and is a laborious and time-consuming process. One needs to not only understand the data in depth but also produce intricate graphical representations. To assist in the design process, we present DataShot which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first automated system that creates fact sheets automatically from tabular data. First, we conduct a qualitative analysis of 245 infographic examples to explore general infographic design space at both the sheet and element levels. We identify common infographic structures, sheet layouts, fact types, and visualization styles during the study. Based on these findings, we propose a fact sheet generation pipeline, consisting of fact extraction, fact composition, and presentation synthesis, for the auto-generation workflow. To validate our system, we present use cases with three real-world datasets. We conduct an in-lab user study to understand the usage of our system. Our evaluation results show that DataShot can efficiently generate satisfactory fact sheets to support further customization and data presentation.","article_number":"8805442","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8805442","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805442/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805442/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"895","end_page":"905","citing_paper_count":69,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2498,"insert_date":"20190819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Data mining","Statistical analysis","Computer graphics","Data analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Fact sheet","infographic","visualization","and automated design"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Automatic Generation","Fact Sheet","Design Process","User Study","Graphic Design","Visual Style","Present Data","Athletes","Visual Representation","Storytelling","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Categorical Values","Understanding Of The Data","Design Goals","Visual Elements","Pictograms","Pictographs","Control Panel","Visual Design","Design Options","Line Chart","Subjective Feedback","Single Sheet","Meaningful Themes","Meaningful Topics","Column Chart"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934287","title":"Why Authors Don't Visualize Uncertainty","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":6,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Northwestern University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38016234500","id":38016234500,"full_name":"Jessica Hullman","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Clear presentation of uncertainty is an exception rather than rule in media articles, data-driven reports, and consumer applications, despite proposed techniques for communicating sources of uncertainty in data. This work considers, Why do so many visualization authors choose not to visualize uncertainty? I contribute a detailed characterization of practices, associations, and attitudes related to uncertainty communication among visualization authors, derived from the results of surveying 90 authors who regularly create visualizations for others as part of their work, and interviewing thirteen influential visualization designers. My results highlight challenges that authors face and expose assumptions and inconsistencies in beliefs about the role of uncertainty in visualization. In particular, a clear contradiction arises between authors' acknowledgment of the value of depicting uncertainty and the norm of omitting direct depiction of uncertainty. To help explain this contradiction, I present a rhetorical model of uncertainty omission in visualization-based communication. I also adapt a formal statistical model of how viewers judge the strength of a signal in a visualization to visualization-based communication, to argue that uncertainty communication necessarily reduces degrees of freedom in viewers' statistical inferences. I conclude with recommendations for how visualization research on uncertainty communication could better serve practitioners' current needs and values while deepening understanding of assumptions that reinforce uncertainty omission.","article_number":"8805422","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8805422","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805422/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805422/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"130","end_page":"139","citing_paper_count":68,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2132,"insert_date":"20190819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty","Data visualization","Visualization","Interviews","Decision making","Media","Adaptation models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty visualization","graphical statistical inference","visualization rhetoric"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Rhetoric","Model Formulation","Statistical Inference","Vision Research","Visual Design","Uncertainty Communication","Audience","Ireland","Model Specification","Survey Results","Journalism","Survey Respondents","Plaintext","Clear Message","Uncertainty Values","Uncertainty Information","Variance Function","Discrepancy Function","Text Representation","Signal Detection Theory","Detection Theory","Reference Distribution","Fundamental Measure","Fundamental Quantities","Multiple Interviews","Multiple Respondents","Representation Of Uncertainty","Posterior Predictive Distribution","Model Checking"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934668","title":"FlowSense: A Natural Language Interface for Visual Data Exploration within a Dataflow System","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":7,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085505340","id":37085505340,"full_name":"Bowen Yu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University"]}},{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275249200","id":37275249200,"full_name":"Cláudio T.

Various authoring tools have been proposed to facilitate the creation of infographics. However, creating a professional infographic with these authoring tools is still not an easy task, requiring much time and design expertise. Therefore, these tools are generally not attractive to casual users, who are either unwilling to take time to learn the tools or lacking in proper design expertise to create a professional infographic. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach: to automatically generate infographics from natural language statements. We first conducted a preliminary study to explore the design space of infographics. Based on the preliminary study, we built a proof-of-concept system that automatically converts statements about simple proportion-related statistics to a set of infographics with pre-designed styles. Finally, we demonstrated the usability and usefulness of the system through sample results, exhibits, and expert reviews.","article_number":"8813126","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8813126","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8813126/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8813126/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"906","end_page":"916","citing_paper_count":58,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2302,"insert_date":"20190826","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Tools","Sports","Authoring systems","Natural languages","Social networking (online)"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization for the masses","infographic","automatic visualization","presentation","and dissemination"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Natural Language","Infographic","Graphical Display","Automatic Generation","Natural Language Statements","Natural-language Statements","Design Space","Design Expert","Convolutional Neural Network","Years Of Experience","Creativity","Creative Thinking","Aspect Ratio","Types Of Information","Rate Of Return","Return On Investment","Blueprint","Text Analysis","Bar Charts","Pie Chart","Audience Members","Visual Elements","Conditional Random Field","Named Entity Recognition","Entity Extraction","Named-entity Recognition","Color Palette","Colour Palette","Textual Patterns","Number Of Facts","Pictograms","Pictographs","Creative Design","Graphical Elements","Typical Layout","Type Of Visualization","Convolutional Neural Network Layers","Graphic Design"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934251","title":"Supporting Analysis of Dimensionality Reduction Results with Contrastive Learning","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":10,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086133964","id":37086133964,"full_name":"Takanori Fujiwara","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085484504","id":37085484504,"full_name":"Oh-Hyun Kwon","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275869400","id":37275869400,"full_name":"Kwan-Liu Ma","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Dimensionality reduction (DR) is frequently used for analyzing and visualizing high-dimensional data as it provides a good first glance of the data. However, to interpret the DR result for gaining useful insights from the data, it would take additional analysis effort such as identifying clusters and understanding their characteristics. While there are many automatic methods (e.g., density-based clustering methods) to identify clusters, effective methods for understanding a cluster's characteristics are still lacking. A cluster can be mostly characterized by its distribution of feature values. Reviewing the original feature values is not a straightforward task when the number of features is large. To address this challenge, we present a visual analytics method that effectively highlights the essential features of a cluster in a DR result. To extract the essential features, we introduce an enhanced usage of contrastive principal component analysis (cPCA). Our method, called ccPCA (contrasting clusters in PCA), can calculate each feature's relative contribution to the contrast between one cluster and other clusters. With ccPCA, we have created an interactive system including a scalable visualization of clusters' feature contributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and system with case studies using several publicly available datasets.","article_number":"8805461","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8805461","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805461/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805461/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"45","end_page":"55","citing_paper_count":51,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2281,"insert_date":"20190819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Principal component analysis","Task analysis","Data visualization","Visual analytics","Dimensionality reduction","Feature extraction"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Dimensionality reduction","contrastive learning","principal component analysis","high-dimensional data","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Dimensionality Reduction","Self-supervised Learning","Contrastive Learning","Feature Values","Characteristic Values","Clustering Method","Clustering Methods","Visual Analysis","Interactive System","Automatic Method","Automatic Methods","Feature Clustering","Cluster Characteristics","Contribution Of Features","Contribution Of Characteristics","Contribution Of Each Feature","Histogram","Discriminant Analysis","Feature Representation","Linear Discriminant Analysis","Discriminant Function","Discriminant Function Analysis","Original Structure","Number Of Data Points","Dimensionality Reduction Methods","Dimensionality Reduction Method","Eigenvectors Of Matrix","Automatic Selection","Aggregation Method","Aggregation Methods","Target Dataset","Target Data Set","Background Dataset","Background Data Set","Sign Flip","Multiple Correspondence Analysis","Parallel Coordinates","UCI Machine Learning Repository","Cluster Labels","Maximum Absolute Value","Empirical Covariance Matrix","Empirical Covariance Matrices","Spectral Clustering","Missing Values"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934433","title":"An Incremental Dimensionality Reduction Method for Visualizing Streaming Multidimensional Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":11,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086133964","id":37086133964,"full_name":"Takanori Fujiwara","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085795830","id":37085795830,"full_name":"Jia-Kai Chou","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100249","id":37087100249,"full_name":"Shilpika Shilpika","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis"]}},{"affiliation":"Bosch Research North America","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085776768","id":37085776768,"full_name":"Panpan Xu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Bosch Research North America"]}},{"affiliation":"Bosch Research North America","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086048784","id":37086048784,"full_name":"Liu Ren","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Bosch Research North America"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275869400","id":37275869400,"full_name":"Kwan-Liu Ma","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Dimensionality reduction (DR) methods are commonly used for analyzing and visualizing multidimensional data.

In addition, the problem becomes even more challenging when the dynamic data records have a varying number of dimensions as often found in real-world applications. This paper presents an incremental DR solution. We enhance an existing incremental PCA method in several ways to ensure its usability for visualizing streaming multidimensional data. First, we use geometric transformation and animation methods to help preserve a viewer's mental map when visualizing the incremental results. Second, to handle data dimension variants, we use an optimization method to estimate the projected data positions, and also convey the resulting uncertainty in the visualization.

We propose a well-established hybrid second-order Markov chain model to characterize and simulate the competition process in table tennis. Compared with existing methods, our approach is the first to support the effective simulation of tactics, which represent high-level competition strategies in table tennis. Furthermore, we introduce a visual analytics system called Tac-Simur based on the proposed model for simulative visual analytics. Tac-Simur enables users to easily navigate different players and their tactics based on their respective performance in matches to identify the player and the tactics of interest for further analysis. Then, users can utilize the system to interactively explore diverse simulation tasks and visually explain the simulation results. The effectiveness and usefulness of this work are demonstrated by two case studies, in which domain experts utilize Tac-Simur to find interesting and valuable insights. The domain experts also provide positive feedback on the usability of Tac-Simur.

Once this view takes shape, we look at how interaction is defined in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI). By extracting commonalities and differences between the views of interaction in visualization and in HCI, we synthesize a definition of interaction for visualization.

which requires considerable domain experience and heavy cognition effort and frequently results in incorrect signal judgment and incomprehensive situation awareness. Faced with increasingly complicated electromagnetic environments, radio supervisors urgently need additional data sources and advanced analytical technologies to enhance their situation awareness ability. This paper introduces a visual analytics approach for electromagnetic situation awareness. Guided by a detailed scenario and requirement analysis, we first propose a signal clustering method to process radio signal data and a situation assessment model to obtain qualitative and quantitative descriptions of the electromagnetic situations. We then design a two-module interface with a set of visualization views and interactions to help radio supervisors perceive and understand the electromagnetic situations by a joint analysis of radio signal data and radio spectrum data. Evaluations on real-world data sets and an interview with actual users demonstrate the effectiveness of our prototype system. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the proposed approach and provide future work directions.","article_number":"8807351","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8807351","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807351/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807351/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"590","end_page":"600","citing_paper_count":45,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1548,"insert_date":"20190820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Electromagnetics","Time-frequency analysis","Monitoring","Computational modeling","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Radio monitoring and management","radio signal data","radio spectrum data","situation awareness","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Situational Awareness","Frequency Band","Clustering Method","Clustering Methods","Real-world Datasets","Real-world Data Sets","Radio Waves","Wireless Signal","Radio Signals","Radio Emission","Joint Analysis","Set Of Interactions","Prototype System","Visual Approach","Situation Assessment","Electromagnetic Environment","Interaction Analysis","Daily Work","Visual Perception","Center Frequency","Clustering Results","Signal Frequency","Multidimensional Data","Multidimensional Analysis","Signal Distribution","Visual Design","Signal Time","Understanding Of The Situation","Target User","Sparse Grid","Dense Grid","Mental Maps","Cluster Centers","10-s Intervals","Perception Of The Situation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934538","title":"Data Changes Everything: Challenges and Opportunities in Data Visualization Design Handoff","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":15,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38016653500","id":38016653500,"full_name":"Jagoda Walny","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37569601600","id":37569601600,"full_name":"Christian Frisson","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada","McGill University, Montreal, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100057","id":37087100057,"full_name":"Mieka West","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100097","id":37087100097,"full_name":"Doris Kosminsky","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada","Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077629700","id":37077629700,"full_name":"Søren Knudsen","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada","University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37285000100","id":37285000100,"full_name":"Sheelagh Carpendale","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada","Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945380800","id":37945380800,"full_name":"Wesley Willett","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Complex data visualization design projects often entail collaboration between people with different visualization-related skills. For example, many teams include both designers who create new visualization designs and developers who implement the resulting visualization software. We identify gaps between data characterization tools, visualization design tools, and development platforms that pose challenges for designer-developer teams working to create new data visualizations. While it is common for commercial interaction design tools to support collaboration between designers and developers, creating data visualizations poses several unique challenges that are not supported by current tools. In particular, visualization designers must characterize and build an understanding of the underlying data, then specify layouts, data encodings, and other data-driven parameters that will be robust across many different data values. In larger teams, designers must also clearly communicate these mappings and their dependencies to developers, clients, and other collaborators. We report observations and reflections from five large multidisciplinary visualization design projects and highlight six data-specific visualization challenges for design specification and handoff. These challenges include adapting to changing data, anticipating edge cases in data, understanding technical challenges, articulating data-dependent interactions, communicating data mappings, and preserving the integrity of data mappings across iterations. Based on these observations, we identify opportunities for future tools for prototyping, testing, and communicating data-driven designs, which might contribute to more successful and collaborative data visualization design.","article_number":"8816695","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8816695","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8816695/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8816695/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"12","end_page":"22","citing_paper_count":45,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":4351,"insert_date":"20190827","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Tools","Collaboration","Design tools","Software","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Information visualization","design handoff","data mapping","design process"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Visualization","Visual Design","Data Visualization Design","Prototype","Design Tool","Ideal Tool","Technical Challenges","Interaction Design","Commercial Tools","Edge Cases","Design Process","Role In Design","Interactive System","Visual Comparison","Development Team","Team Spirit","Team Building","Aspects Of Design","Design Phase","Updated Data","Interactive Tool","Physical Separation","Design Work","Design Team","Graphic Design","Design Documents","Visible Part","Input Combinations","Visual Projection","Inter-American Development Bank","Communication Challenges","Graphical Tool","Team Members"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934395","title":"The Impact of Immersion on Cluster Identification Tasks","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":16,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086236869","id":37086236869,"full_name":"M.

VR environments (VREs) enable new, more immersive visualization design spaces compared to traditional computer screens. Previous studies in different domains, such as medicine, psychology, and geology, report a positive effect of immersion, e.g., on learning performance or phobia treatment effectiveness. Our work presented in this paper assesses the applicability of those findings to a common task from the information visualization (InfoVis) domain. We conducted a quantitative user study to investigate the impact of immersion on cluster identification tasks in scatterplot visualizations. The main experiment was carried out with 18 participants in a within-subjects setting using four different visualizations, (1) a 2D scatterplot matrix on a screen, (2) a 3D scatterplot on a screen, (3) a 3D scatterplot miniature in a VRE and (4) a fully immersive 3D scatterplot in a VRE. The four visualization design spaces vary in their level of immersion, as shown in a supplementary study. The results of our main study indicate that task performance differs between the investigated visualization design spaces in terms of accuracy, efficiency, memorability, sense of orientation, and user preference. In particular, the 2D visualization on the screen performed worse compared to the 3D visualizations with regard to the measured variables. The study shows that an increased level of immersion can be a substantial benefit in the context of 3D data and cluster detection.","article_number":"8836087","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8836087","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8836087/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8836087/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"525","end_page":"535","citing_paper_count":44,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1309,"insert_date":"20190913","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Task analysis","Two dimensional displays","Visualization","Virtual reality","Dimensionality reduction"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Virtual reality","evaluation","visual analytics","clustering"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Task Design","Identification Task","Identification Of Clusters","Design Space","3D Visualization","Head-mounted Display","Level Of Immersion","2D Visualization","Effect Of Immersion","Scatterplot Matrix","Scatter Plot Matrix","Scatterplot Matrices","3D Scatter Plot","3D Scatterplot","Time And Space","Spacetime","Error Rate","Spatial Memory","Spatial Working Memory","Spatial Learning","Data Clustering","3D Space","3-dimensional Space","Experimental Factors","Dense Clusters","Compact Clusters","Types Of Clusters","Overview Of Data","Three-dimensional Data","Task Completion Time","Interaction Techniques","Degree Of Immersion","Clusters In Dataset","2D Space","Kinds Of Datasets","Kinds Of Data Sets","Cluster Shape","DBSCAN Algorithm","Percentage Of Clusters","Subjective Opinions"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934397","title":"A Comparative Evaluation of Animation and Small Multiples for Trend Visualization on Mobile Phones","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":17,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37719161300","id":37719161300,"full_name":"Matthew Brehmer","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37293389400","id":37293389400,"full_name":"Bongshin Lee","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Inria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591317800","id":37591317800,"full_name":"Petra Isenberg","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Inria"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland, College Park","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085751692","id":37085751692,"full_name":"Eun Kyoung Choe","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We compare the efficacy of animated and small multiples variants of scatterplots on mobile phones for comparing trends in multivariate datasets.

Incorporating similar experimental stimuli and tasks, we conducted an experiment where 96 crowdworker participants performed nine trend comparison tasks using their mobile phones. We found that those using a small multiples design consistently completed tasks in less time, albeit with slightly less confidence than those using an animated design. The accuracy results were more task-dependent, and we further interpret our results according to the characteristics of the individual tasks, with a specific focus on the trajectories of target and distractor data items in each task. We identify cases that appear to favor either animation or small multiples, providing new questions for further experimental research and implications for visualization design on mobile devices.

As the deployment of artificial intelligence technologies becomes ubiquitous, it is unsurprising that adversaries have begun developing methods to manipulate machine learning models to their advantage. While the visual analytics community has developed methods for opening the black box of machine learning models, little work has focused on helping the user understand their model vulnerabilities in the context of adversarial attacks. In this paper, we present a visual analytics framework for explaining and exploring model vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. Our framework employs a multi-faceted visualization scheme designed to support the analysis of data poisoning attacks from the perspective of models, data instances, features, and local structures. We demonstrate our framework through two case studies on binary classifiers and illustrate model vulnerabilities with respect to varying attack strategies.","article_number":"8812988","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8812988","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8812988/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8812988/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"1075","end_page":"1085","citing_paper_count":38,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2113,"insert_date":"20190826","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Analytical models","Machine learning","Visual analytics","Training","Predictive models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Adversarial machine learning","data poisoning","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Machine Learning","Machine-learning","Visual Analysis","Generative Adversarial Networks","Adversarial Learning","Machine Learning Models","Local Structure","Data Instances","Instantaneous Data","Perspective Of Model","Adversarial Attacks","Attack Strategy","Attack Scheme","Visual Framework","Model Performance","Training Data","Training Dataset","Training Data Set","Performance Metrics","Class Probabilities","Domain Experts","Decision Boundary","Specific Instances","Recall Score","Spam Emails","Bulk Email","Unsolicited Emails","Local View","Adversarial Examples","Nearest Neighbor Graph","Nearest Neighbour Graph","Impact Of Attacks","Visual Design","Projection Views","Radar Chart","Radar Graph","Attack Vector","Feature Importance Measures"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934539","title":"Criteria for Rigor in Visualization Design Study","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":19,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564728700","id":37564728700,"full_name":"Miriah Meyer","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"City, University of London","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37605079900","id":37605079900,"full_name":"Jason Dykes","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["City, University of London"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We develop a new perspective on research conducted through visualization design study that emphasizes design as a method of inquiry and the broad range of knowledge-contributions achieved through it as multiple, subjective, and socially constructed.

We propose that rigor is established and judged according to the extent to which visualization design study research and its reporting are INFORMED, REFLEXIVE, ABUNDANT, PLAUSIBLE, RESONANT, and TRANSPARENT. This perspective and the criteria were constructed through a four-year engagement with the discourse around rigor and the nature of knowledge in social science, information systems, and design. We suggest methods from cognate disciplines that can support visualization researchers in meeting these criteria during the planning, execution, and reporting of design study. Through a series of deliberately provocative questions, we explore implications of this new perspective for design study research in visualization, concluding that as a discipline, visualization is not yet well positioned to embrace, nurture, and fully benefit from a rigorous, interpretivist approach to design study.

It reveals clusters of high-dimensional data points at different scales while only requiring minimal tuning of its parameters. However, the computational complexity of the algorithm limits its application to relatively small datasets. To address this problem, several evolutions of t-SNE have been developed in recent years, mainly focusing on the scalability of the similarity computations between data points. However, these contributions are insufficient to achieve interactive rates when visualizing the evolution of the t-SNE embedding for large datasets. In this work, we present a novel approach to the minimization of the t-SNE objective function that heavily relies on graphics hardware and has linear computational complexity. Our technique decreases the computational cost of running t-SNE on datasets by orders of magnitude and retains or improves on the accuracy of past approximated techniques. We propose to approximate the repulsive forces between data points by splatting kernel textures for each data point. This approximation allows us to reformulate the t-SNE minimization problem as a series of tensor operations that can be efficiently executed on the graphics card.

Their black-box nature also makes it a challenging task to incorporate domain-specific knowledge of the experts into the model. In ProtoSteer (Prototype Steering), we tackle the challenge of directly involving the domain experts to steer a deep sequence model without relying on model developers as intermediaries. Our approach originates in case-based reasoning, which imitates the common human problem-solving process of consulting past experiences to solve new problems. We utilize ProSeNet (Prototype Sequence Network), which learns a small set of exemplar cases (i.e., prototypes) from historical data. In ProtoSteer they serve both as an efficient visual summary of the original data and explanations of model decisions. With ProtoSteer the domain experts can inspect, critique, and revise the prototypes interactively. The system then incorporates user-specified prototypes and incrementally updates the model. We conduct extensive case studies and expert interviews in application domains including sentiment analysis on texts and predictive diagnostics based on vehicle fault logs. The results demonstrate that involvements of domain users can help obtain more interpretable models with concise prototypes while retaining similar accuracy.","article_number":"8827944","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8827944","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8827944/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8827944/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"238","end_page":"248","citing_paper_count":36,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1813,"insert_date":"20190910","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Prototypes","Data visualization","Data models","Machine learning","Computational modeling","Predictive models","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Sequence Data","Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)","Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)","Prototype Learning"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Deep Sequencing","Deep Sequence Model","Black Box","Deep Models","Model Interpretation","Applicability Domain","Application Domains","Domain Experts","Sentiment Analysis","Sentiment Classification","Expert Interviews","Case-based Reasoning","Case Based Reasoning","Incremental Update","Machine Learning","Machine-learning","Deep Neural Network","Similarity Score","Recurrent Neural Network","Input Sequence","Latent Space","Embedding Space","Design Requirements","Exact Match","Hidden State","Sequence Encoding","Interactive Visualization","Latent Representation","Interaction Design","Iterative Refinement","Original Training Data","Detailed View","Visual Interface","Visual Design","Prototype-based","Prototype Based"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934312","title":"InSituNet: Deep Image Synthesis for Parameter Space Exploration of Ensemble Simulations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":22,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085433063","id":37085433063,"full_name":"Wenbin He","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085897852","id":37085897852,"full_name":"Junpeng Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085681553","id":37085681553,"full_name":"Hanqi Guo","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086057389","id":37086057389,"full_name":"Ko-Chih Wang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279493500","id":37279493500,"full_name":"Han-Wei Shen","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085807335","id":37085807335,"full_name":"Mukund Raj","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38546786000","id":38546786000,"full_name":"Youssef S.

Although multiple image-based approaches have been proposed to mitigate this limitation, those approaches lack the ability to explore the simulation parameters. Our approach allows flexible exploration of parameter space for large-scale ensemble simulations by taking advantage of the recent advances in deep learning. Specifically, we design InSituNet as a convolutional regression model to learn the mapping from the simulation and visualization parameters to the visualization results. With the trained model, users can generate new images for different simulation parameters under various visualization settings, which enables in-depth analysis of the underlying ensemble simulations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of InSituNet in combustion, cosmology, and ocean simulations through quantitative and qualitative evaluations.","article_number":"8805426","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8805426","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805426/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805426/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"23","end_page":"33","citing_paper_count":35,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1702,"insert_date":"20190819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Data models","Visualization","Analytical models","Space exploration","Deep learning","Image synthesis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["In situ visualization","ensemble visualization","parameter space exploration","deep learning","image synthesis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Parameter Space","Image Synthesis","Rendering Engine","3D Renderings","Ensemble Simulations","Deep Learning","Simulated Data","Simulation Parameters","Cosmological","Advances In Deep Learning","Large-scale Simulations","Large Scale Simulations","Visual Parameters","Combustion Simulations","Post Hoc Test","Post Hoc Analysis","Deep Neural Network","Parameter Settings","Transfer Function","Visual Images","Visual Inspection Of Images","Parametric Mapping","Parameter Sensitivity","Generative Adversarial Networks","Adversarial Learning","Parameters In Group","Fréchet Inception Distance","Frechet Inception Distance","Earth Mover’s Distance","Ground Truth Image","Peak Signal-to-noise Ratio","Peak Signal To Noise Ratio","PSNR","Arbitrary Parameters","Spectral Normalization","Visual Map","Residual Block","Latent Vector","Forward Propagation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934281","title":"Critical Reflections on Visualization Authoring Systems","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":23,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085729682","id":37085729682,"full_name":"Arvind Satyanarayan","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37293389400","id":37293389400,"full_name":"Bongshin Lee","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Santa Barbara","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077502100","id":37077502100,"full_name":"Donghao Ren","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Santa Barbara"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550791300","id":37550791300,"full_name":"Jeffrey Heer","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Washington"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267736900","id":37267736900,"full_name":"John Stasko","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101651","id":37087101651,"full_name":"John Thompson","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37719161300","id":37719161300,"full_name":"Matthew Brehmer","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Adobe Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592993600","id":37592993600,"full_name":"Zhicheng Liu","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Adobe Research"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"An emerging generation of visualization authoring systems support expressive information visualization without textual programming.

Finding a “good” layout of a graph is thus an important task for graph visualization. In practice, users often visualize a graph in multiple layouts by using different methods and varying parameter settings until they find a layout that best suits the purpose of the visualization. However, this trial-and-error process is often haphazard and time-consuming. To provide users with an intuitive way to navigate the layout design space, we present a technique to systematically visualize a graph in diverse layouts using deep generative models. We design an encoder-decoder architecture to learn a model from a collection of example layouts, where the encoder represents training examples in a latent space and the decoder produces layouts from the latent space. In particular, we train the model to construct a two-dimensional latent space for users to easily explore and generate various layouts. We demonstrate our approach through quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated layouts. The results of our evaluations show that our model is capable of learning and generalizing abstract concepts of graph layouts, not just memorizing the training examples. In summary, this paper presents a fundamentally new approach to graph visualization where a machine learning model learns to visualize a graph from examples without manually-defined heuristics.","article_number":"8805452","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8805452","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805452/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805452/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"665","end_page":"675","citing_paper_count":32,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1760,"insert_date":"20190819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Layout","Training","Visualization","Task analysis","Data visualization","Machine learning","Data models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Graph","network","visualization","layout","machine learning","deep learning","neural network","generative model","autoencoder"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Deep Generative Models","Graph Layout","Graph Drawing","Machine Learning Models","Latent Space","Embedding Space","Training Examples","Visibility Graph","Intuitive Way","Amount Of Time","High-dimensional","High-dimensional Space","Generative Adversarial Networks","Adversarial Learning","Nodes In The Graph","Graph Structure","Node Positions","Location Of Nodes","Graph Convolutional Network","Graph Convolutional Neural Network","Random Search","Latent Representation","Variational Autoencoder","Graph Neural Networks","Considerable Amount Of Time","Reconstruction Loss","Node Representations","Wasserstein Distance","Wasserstein Metric","Input Object","Equivalent Structure","Blue Nodes","Type Of Interface","Permutation Matrix","Permutation Matrices","Aggregation Step","Reasonable Amount Of Time","Usage Time"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934810","title":"Towards Automated Infographic Design: Deep Learning-based Auto-Extraction of Extensible Timeline","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":25,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37090037186","id":37090037186,"full_name":"Chen Zhu-Tian","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086545328","id":37086545328,"full_name":"Yun Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543277","id":37086543277,"full_name":"Qianwen Wang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085635207","id":37085635207,"full_name":"Yong Wang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Designers need to consider not only perceptual effectiveness but also visual styles when creating an infographic. This process can be difficult and time consuming for professional designers, not to mention non-expert users, leading to the demand for automated infographics design. As a first step, we focus on timeline infographics, which have been widely used for centuries. We contribute an end-to-end approach that automatically extracts an extensible timeline template from a bitmap image. Our approach adopts a deconstruction and reconstruction paradigm. At the deconstruction stage, we propose a multi-task deep neural network that simultaneously parses two kinds of information from a bitmap timeline: 1) the global information, i.e., the representation, scale, layout, and orientation of the timeline, and 2) the local information, i.e., the location, category, and pixels of each visual element on the timeline. At the reconstruction stage, we propose a pipeline with three techniques, i.e., Non-Maximum Merging, Redundancy Recover, and DL GrabCut, to extract an extensible template from the infographic, by utilizing the deconstruction results. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we synthesize a timeline dataset (4296 images) and collect a real-world timeline dataset (393 images) from the Internet. We first report quantitative evaluation results of our approach over the two datasets. Then, we present examples of automatically extracted templates and timelines automatically generated based on these templates to qualitatively demonstrate the performance. The results confirm that our approach can effectively extract extensible templates from real-world timeline infographics.","article_number":"8807266","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8807266","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807266/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807266/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"917","end_page":"926","citing_paper_count":29,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1657,"insert_date":"20240312","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Data visualization","Data mining","Image reconstruction","Pipelines","Image coding","Object detection"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Automated Infographic Design","Deep Learning-based Approach","Timeline Infographics","Multi-task Model"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Infographic","Graphical Display","Neural Network","Deep Neural Network","Local Information","Global Information","Kind Of Information","Deconstruction","Visual Style","Reconstruction Stage","Convolutional Neural Network","Feature Maps","Intersection Over Union","Jaccard Similarity","Jaccard Distance","Jaccard Index","Precision And Recall","Bounding Box","Natural Elements","Translation Invariance","Translational Symmetry","Linear Representation","Equivalent Representation","Font Size","Feature Pyramid Network","Non-maximum Suppression","Categories Of Elements","Graphical Elements","Visual Encoding","Text Annotation","Decrease In Precision","Microsoft PowerPoint","Microsoft Office PowerPoint","Graphic Images","Half Of Events","Half Of These Events","Reconstruction Pipeline","Fully Convolutional Network"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934399","title":"Illusion of Causality in Visualized Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":26,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Northwestern University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102197","id":37087102197,"full_name":"Cindy Xiong","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University"]}},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University, Kellogg School of Management","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102511","id":37087102511,"full_name":"Joel Shapiro","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University, Kellogg School of Management"]}},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38016234500","id":38016234500,"full_name":"Jessica Hullman","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University"]}},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077249100","id":37077249100,"full_name":"Steven Franconeri","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Students who eat breakfast more frequently tend to have a higher grade point average. From this data, many people might confidently state that a before-school breakfast program would lead to higher grades. This is a reasoning error, because correlation does not necessarily indicate causation - X and Y can be correlated without one directly causing the other. While this error is pervasive, its prevalence might be amplified or mitigated by the way that the data is presented to a viewer. Across three crowdsourced experiments, we examined whether how simple data relations are presented would mitigate this reasoning error. The first experiment tested examples similar to the breakfast-GPA relation, varying in the plausibility of the causal link. We asked participants to rate their level of agreement that the relation was correlated, which they rated appropriately as high. However, participants also expressed high agreement with a causal interpretation of the data. Levels of support for the causal interpretation were not equally strong across visualization types: causality ratings were highest for text descriptions and bar graphs, but weaker for scatter plots. But is this effect driven by bar graphs aggregating data into two groups or by the visual encoding type? We isolated data aggregation versus visual encoding type and examined their individual effect on perceived causality. Overall, different visualization designs afford different cognitive reasoning affordances across the same data. High levels of data aggregation by graphs tend to be associated with higher perceived causality in data. Participants perceived line and dot visual encodings as more causal than bar encodings. Our results demonstrate how some visualization designs trigger stronger causal links while choosing others can help mitigate unwarranted perceptions of causality.","article_number":"8805448","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8805448","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805448/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805448/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"853","end_page":"862","citing_paper_count":29,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1373,"insert_date":"20190819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Correlation","Data visualization","Bars","Task analysis","Visualization","Cognition","Encoding"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Information Visualization","Correlation and Causation","Visualization Design","Reasoning Affordance"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Causal Illusions","Scatter Plot","Plausibility","Aggregate Data","Breakfast","Aggregate Level","Bar Graphs","Causal Interpretation","Visual Design","Cognitive Reasoning","Visual Encoding","Causal Relationship","Pilot Testing","Pilot Experiments","Pilot Trial","Lowest Rate","Political Orientation","Political Attitudes","Political Spectrum","Political Positions","Order Effects","Experimental Variables","Bar Charts","Types Of States","Visual Markers","Judgment Task","Line Graph","Amount Of Aggregates","Aggregate Quantity","Visual Context","Rectangular Bars","Causal Conclusions","Pairs Of Variables","Internet Explorer","Group-wise Comparisons"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934547","title":"Facetto: Combining Unsupervised and Supervised Learning for Hierarchical Phenotype Analysis in Multi-Channel Image Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":27,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085432818","id":37085432818,"full_name":"Robert Krueger","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, USA","Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37409575800","id":37409575800,"full_name":"Johanna Beyer","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38552116500","id":38552116500,"full_name":"Won-Dong Jang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085685242","id":37085685242,"full_name":"Nam Wook Kim","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100157","id":37087100157,"full_name":"Artem Sokolov","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37830933100","id":37830933100,"full_name":"Peter K.

Such images represent the cutting edge of digital histology and promise to revolutionize how diseases such as cancer are studied, diagnosed, and treated. Highly multiplexed tissue images are complex, comprising 109 or more pixels, 60-plus channels, and millions of individual cells. This makes manual analysis challenging and error-prone. Existing automated approaches are also inadequate, in large part, because they are unable to effectively exploit the deep knowledge of human tissue biology available to anatomic pathologists. To overcome these challenges, Facetto enables a semi-automated analysis of cell types and states. It integrates unsupervised and supervised learning into the image and feature exploration process and offers tools for analytical provenance. Experts can cluster the data to discover new types of cancer and immune cells and use clustering results to train a convolutional neural network that classifies new cells accordingly. Likewise, the output of classifiers can be clustered to discover aggregate patterns and phenotype subsets. We also introduce a new hierarchical approach to keep track of analysis steps and data subsets created by users; this assists in the identification of cell types. Users can build phenotype trees and interact with the resulting hierarchical structures of both high-dimensional feature and image spaces. We report on use-cases in which domain scientists explore various large-scale fluorescence imaging datasets. We demonstrate how Facetto assists users in steering the clustering and classification process, inspecting analysis results, and gaining new scientific insights into cancer biology.","article_number":"8827951","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8827951","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8827951/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8827951/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"227","end_page":"237","citing_paper_count":29,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1226,"insert_date":"20190910","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Cancer","Tools","Visualization","Rendering (computer graphics)","Biomedical imaging","Multiplexing"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Clustering","Classification","Visual Analysis","Multiplex Tissue Imaging","Digital Pathology","Cancer Systems Biology"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Imaging Data","Hierarchical Analysis","Supervised Learning","Supervised Classification","Supervised Machine Learning","Phenotypic Analysis","Multichannel Images","Multichannel Image Data","Cell Types","Cell-type","Immune Cells","T Cell Responses","Cell-mediated","Cell State","Status Of Cells","Cells In Conditions","Individual Cells","Convolutional Neural Network","Feature Space","Subset Of Data","Clustering Results","Tissue Imaging","Image Space","Tumor Imaging","Anatomic Pathology","Image Analysis","Expectation Maximization","Expectation-maximization","EM Algorithm","Expectation-maximization Algorithm","Expectation Maximization Algorithm","Tree Nodes","Channel Images","Cell Biology","Cellular Biology","Computational Biology","Visual Analytics Tool","Image Features","Imaging Characteristics","Image Pyramid","Image Pyramids","Interactive Exploration","Cell Imaging"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934284","title":"Color Crafting: Automating the Construction of Designer Quality Color Ramps","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":28,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Colorado Boulder","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086260072","id":37086260072,"full_name":"Stephen Smart","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Colorado Boulder"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Colorado Boulder","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101096","id":37087101096,"full_name":"Keke Wu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Colorado Boulder"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Colorado Boulder","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085770068","id":37085770068,"full_name":"Danielle Albers Szafir","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Colorado Boulder"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Visualizations often encode numeric data using sequential and diverging color ramps.

Our goal is to enable visualization developers to readily create effective color encodings using a single seed color. We do this using an algorithmic approach that models designer practices by analyzing patterns in the structure of designer-crafted color ramps. We construct these models from a corpus of 222 expert-designed color ramps, and use the results to automatically generate ramps that mimic designer practices. We evaluate our approach through an empirical study comparing the outputs of our approach with designer-crafted color ramps. Our models produce ramps that support accurate and aesthetically pleasing visualizations at least as well as designer ramps and that outperform conventional mathematical approaches.","article_number":"8805429","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8805429","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805429/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805429/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"1215","end_page":"1225","citing_paper_count":28,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":998,"insert_date":"20190819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image color analysis","Data visualization","Encoding","Tools","Guidelines","Interpolation","Visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Aesthetics in Visualization","Color Perception","Visual Design","Design Mining"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Color Ramp","Colour Ramp","Years Of Experience","Linear Interpolation","Control Points","Color Space","Colour Space","Color Components","Practical Design","Color Map","Colour Map","Colormap","Colorblind","Color Blindness","Colour-blind","Color Vision Deficiency","Clustering Techniques","Arc Length","Curve Length","Bayesian Clustering","Single Color","Single Colour","Representative Curves","Design Patterns","Visual Design","Color Palette","Colour Palette","Aesthetic Aspects","Esthetic Aspects","Linear Ramp","Choropleth Maps","Sum Of Angles","Important Future Work","Aesthetic Evaluation","Esthetic Evaluation","Aesthetic Ratings","Derivative Curve","Color Vision","Colour Vision","Color Perception","Individual Color","Individual Colour","Significant Effect Of Type","Design Guidelines","Color Word","Color-naming","Color Naming","Color-word","Common Practice","Popular Tool"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934262","title":"FairSight: Visual Analytics for Fairness in Decision Making","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":29,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Pittsburgh","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087099878","id":37087099878,"full_name":"Yongsu Ahn","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Pittsburgh"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Pittsburgh","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085999808","id":37085999808,"full_name":"Yu-Ru Lin","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Pittsburgh"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Data-driven decision making related to individuals has become increasingly pervasive, but the issue concerning the potential discrimination has been raised by recent studies.

As such, there is still an urgent need to create a viable tool to facilitate fair decision making.

Traditional 3D / 4D medical image reconstruction requires near hundreds of projections, which cost insufferable computational time and deliver undesirable high imaging / radiation dose to human subjects. Moreover, it always needs further notorious processes to segment or extract the accurate 3D organ models subsequently. The computational time and imaging dose can be reduced by decreasing the number of projections, but the reconstructed image quality is degraded accordingly. To our knowledge, there is no method directly and explicitly reconstructing multiple 3D organ meshes from a single 2D medical grayscale image on the fly. Given single-view 2D medical images, e.g., 3D / 4D-CT projections or X-ray images, our end-to-end DeepOrganNet framework can efficiently and effectively reconstruct 3D / 4D lung models with a variety of geometric shapes by learning the smooth deformation fields from multiple templates based on a trivariate tensor-product deformation technique, leveraging an informative latent descriptor extracted from input 2D images. The proposed method can guarantee to generate high-quality and high-fidelity manifold meshes for 3D / 4D lung models; while, all current deep learning based approaches on the shape reconstruction from a single image cannot. The major contributions of this work are to accurately reconstruct the 3D organ shapes from 2D single-view projection, significantly improve the procedure time to allow on-the-fly visualization, and dramatically reduce the imaging dose for human subjects. Experimental results are evaluated and compared with the traditional reconstruction method and the state-of-the-art in deep learning, by using extensive 3D and 4D examples, including both synthetic phantom and real patient datasets. The efficiency of the proposed method shows that it only needs several milliseconds to generate organ meshes with 10K vertices, which has great potential to be used in real-time image guided radiation therapy (IGRT).","article_number":"8809843","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8809843","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8809843/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8809843/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"960","end_page":"970","citing_paper_count":27,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1487,"insert_date":"20190822","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three-dimensional displays","Image reconstruction","Shape","Strain","Solid modeling","Biomedical imaging","Two dimensional displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Deep deformation network","organ meshes","3D / 4D shapes","2D projections","single-view"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Deep Network","3D Reconstruction","Lung Model","Neural Network","Deep Learning","Computation Time","Calculation Time","Medical Imaging","Clinical Imaging","Diagnostic Imaging","Deep Neural Network","Single Image","Image Reconstruction","Iterative Reconstruction","Tomographic Reconstruction","Shape Variation","2D Images","Number Of Projects","Grayscale Images","Greyscale Images","Reconstruction Method","Reconstruction Methods","3D Shape","Patient Datasets","Patient Data Sets","Real Patients","Deformation Field","Image-guided Radiotherapy","IGRT","Image Guided Radiotherapy","Image-guided Radiation Therapy","Image Guided Radiation Therapy","Left Lung","3D Mesh","Surface Mesh","Point Cloud","Point Clouds","Earth Mover’s Distance","Deformable Registration","X-ray Projection","Recurrent Neural Network","Volumetric Imaging","Mesh Vertices","Mesh Vertex","Vertex Position","Positions Of Vertices"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934261","title":"Ablate, Variate, and Contemplate: Visual Analytics for Discovering Neural Architectures","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":31,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Tufts University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086047966","id":37086047966,"full_name":"Dylan Cashman","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tufts University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Carnegie Mellon University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294938400","id":37294938400,"full_name":"Adam Perer","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Tufts University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592409400","id":37592409400,"full_name":"Remco Chang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tufts University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"MIT IBM Watson AI Lab, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38108845300","id":38108845300,"full_name":"Hendrik Strobelt","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["MIT IBM Watson AI Lab, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The performance of deep learning models is dependent on the precise configuration of many layers and parameters.

In this paper, we present Rapid Exploration of Model Architectures and Parameters, or REMAP, a visual analytics tool that allows a model builder to discover a deep learning model quickly via exploration and rapid experimentation of neural network architectures. In REMAP, the user explores the large and complex parameter space for neural network architectures using a combination of global inspection and local experimentation. Through a visual overview of a set of models, the user identifies interesting clusters of architectures. Based on their findings, the user can run ablation and variation experiments to identify the effects of adding, removing, or replacing layers in a given architecture and generate new models accordingly. They can also handcraft new models using a simple graphical interface. As a result, a model builder can build deep learning models quickly, efficiently, and without manual programming. We inform the design of REMAP through a design study with four deep learning model builders. Through a use case, we demonstrate that REMAP allows users to discover performant neural network architectures efficiently using visual exploration and user-defined semi-automated searches through the model space.","article_number":"8827593","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8827593","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8827593/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8827593/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"863","end_page":"873","citing_paper_count":26,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":747,"insert_date":"20190909","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Neural networks","Computer architecture","Tools","Training","Visual analytics","Machine learning"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["visual analytics","neural networks","parameter space exploration"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Ablation","Visual Analysis","Neural Architecture","Variate","Neural Network","Model Performance","Learning Models","Set Of Models","Parameter Space","Deep Learning Models","Model Building","Visualization Tool","Space Model","Visual Exploration","Large Parameter Space","Visual Analytics Tool","Machine Learning","Machine-learning","Types Of Models","Model Selection","Convolutional Layers","Neural Architecture Search","Visual Encoding","Pareto Front","Pareto Frontier","Distance Metrics","Portion Of The Dataset","Portion Of The Data Set","Subset Of Models","Saliency Map","Machine Learning Models","Alternative Architectures"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934790","title":"Design by Immersion: A Transdisciplinary Approach to Problem-Driven Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":32,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Temple University, Philadelphia, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085607701","id":37085607701,"full_name":"Kyle Wm.

In scalar field topology, graph-based topological descriptors such as merge trees, contour trees, and Reeb graphs are commonly used to characterize topological changes in the (sub)level sets of scalar fields. One of the biggest challenges and opportunities to advance topology-based visualization is to understand and incorporate uncertainty into such topological descriptors to effectively reason about their underlying data. In this paper, we study a structural average of a set of labeled merge trees and use it to encode uncertainty in data. Specifically, we compute a 1-center tree that minimizes its maximum distance to any other tree in the set under a well-defined metric called the interleaving distance. We provide heuristic strategies that compute structural averages of merge trees whose labels do not fully agree. We further provide an interactive visualization system that resembles a numerical calculator that takes as input a set of merge trees and outputs a tree as their structural average. We also highlight structural similarities between the input and the average and incorporate uncertainty information for visual exploration.

To find the causes of air pollution, the propagation processes of air pollutants must be studied at a large spatial scale. However, the complex and dynamic wind fields lead to highly uncertain pollutant transportation. The state-of-the-art data mining approaches cannot fully support the extensive analysis of such uncertain spatiotemporal propagation processes across multiple districts without the integration of domain knowledge. The limitation of these automated approaches motivates us to design and develop AirVis, a novel visual analytics system that assists domain experts in efficiently capturing and interpreting the uncertain propagation patterns of air pollution based on graph visualizations. Designing such a system poses three challenges: a) the extraction of propagation patterns; b) the scalability of pattern presentations; and c) the analysis of propagation processes. To address these challenges, we develop a novel pattern mining framework to model pollutant transportation and extract frequent propagation patterns efficiently from large-scale atmospheric data. Furthermore, we organize the extracted patterns hierarchically based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle and empower expert users to explore and analyze these patterns effectively on the basis of pattern topologies. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach through two case studies conducted with a real-world dataset and positive feedback from domain experts.","article_number":"8807233","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8807233","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807233/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807233/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"800","end_page":"810","citing_paper_count":23,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2525,"insert_date":"20190820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Air pollution","Data visualization","Data mining","Atmospheric modeling","Transportation","Spatiotemporal phenomena"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Air pollution propagation","pattern mining","graph visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Air Pollution","Visual Analysis","Generation Process","Visual System","Domain Experts","Frequent Pattern","Large Spatial Scales","Visibility Graph","Wind Field","Atmospheric Data","Propagation Patterns","Pattern Extraction","Transport Of Pollutants","Minimum Description Length","Cause Of Pollution","Pattern Mining","Pollution Patterns","Multiple Processes","Propagation Process","Air Quality","Weather Station","Meteorological Stations","Propagation Analysis","Air Parcel","Projection Views","Graph Pattern","Visual Approach","Mass Generation","Mass Propagation","Mass Multiplication","Number Of Graphs","Latent Patterns","Pollution Sources","Word2vec Model"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934255","title":"TSR-TVD: Temporal Super-Resolution for Time-Varying Data Analysis and Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":36,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086862620","id":37086862620,"full_name":"Jun Han","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37405886900","id":37405886900,"full_name":"Chaoli Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present TSR-TVD, a novel deep learning framework that generates temporal super-resolution (TSR) of time-varying data (TVD) using adversarial learning.

In addition to the accuracy and performance gained by our approach over sampling-based strategies, our formulation allows us to perform sensitivity analysis with regard to the uncertainty in the data.

To this end, we expand on recent local optimization approaches by modeling spatially-varying deformations through displacement transformations from continuum mechanics. We compare and discuss the relationships with existing local and integration-based topology extraction methods, showing for instance that separatrices seeded from saddles in the optimal frame align with the integration-based streakline vector field topology. In contrast to the streakline-based approach, our method gives a complete picture of the topology for every time slice, including the steps near the temporal domain boundaries. With our work it now becomes possible to extract topological information even when only few time slices are available.

Prior researches on selection methods were developed mainly based on heuristics such as local point density, thus limiting their applicability in general data. Specific challenges root in the great variabilities implied by point clouds (e.g., dense vs. sparse), viewpoint (e.g., occluded vs. non-occluded), and lasso (e.g., small vs. large). In this work, we introduce LassoNet, a new deep neural network for lasso selection of 3D point clouds, attempting to learn a latent mapping from viewpoint and lasso to point cloud regions. To achieve this, we couple user-target points with viewpoint and lasso information through 3D coordinate transform and naive selection, and improve the method scalability via an intention filtering and farthest point sampling. A hierarchical network is trained using a dataset with over 30K lasso-selection records on two different point cloud data. We conduct a formal user study to compare LassoNet with two state-of-the-art lasso-selection methods. The evaluations confirm that our approach improves the selection effectiveness and efficiency across different combinations of 3D point clouds, viewpoints, and lasso selections.

Of two sets of values depicted in two charts, which set had values that were the highest overall? Which had the widest range? Prior empirical work found that the performance on different visual comparison tasks (e.g., “biggest delta”, “biggest correlation”) varied widely across different combinations of marks and spatial arrangements. In this paper, we expand upon these combinations in an empirical evaluation of two new comparison tasks: the “biggest mean” and “biggest range” between two sets of values. We used a staircase procedure to titrate the difficulty of the data comparison to assess which arrangements produced the most precise comparisons for each task. We find visual comparisons of biggest mean and biggest range are supported by some chart arrangements more than others, and that this pattern is substantially different from the pattern for other tasks. To synthesize these dissonant findings, we argue that we must understand which features of a visualization are actually used by the human visual system to solve a given task. We call these perceptual proxies. For example, when comparing the means of two bar charts, the visual system might use a “Mean length” proxy that isolates the actual lengths of the bars and then constructs a true average across these lengths. Alternatively, it might use a “Hull Area” proxy that perceives an implied hull bounded by the bars of each chart and then compares the areas of these hulls. We propose a series of potential proxies across different tasks, marks, and spatial arrangements. Simple models of these proxies can be empirically evaluated for their explanatory power by matching their performance to human performance across these marks, arrangements, and tasks. We use this process to highlight candidates for perceptual proxies that might scale more broadly to explain performance in visual comparison.","article_number":"8807320","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8807320","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807320/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807320/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"1012","end_page":"1021","citing_paper_count":21,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1120,"insert_date":"20190820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Task analysis","Bars","Correlation","Data visualization","Visual systems","Animation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Graphical perception","visual perception","visual comparison","crowdsourced evaluation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Comparison","Comparison Of Means","Visual System","Human Performance","Human Function","Visual Task","Spatial Arrangement","Bar Charts","Combination Of Markers","Empirical Evaluation","Widest Range","Comparison Task","Staircase Procedure","Bar Length","Centroid","High Precision","Specific Tasks","Differences In Data","Deviation Of Data","Patterns In Data","Visual Features","Visual Characteristics","Global Features","Global Characteristics","Global Quality","Titer Values","Effect Of Placement","Effect Of Arrangement","Global Mode","Largest Mean","Focal Features","Focusing Characteristics","Focus Features","Characteristics Of Focus","Focusing Feature","Global Task","Correlation Scatter Plots","Correlation Scatterplots","Analysis Tasks","Width Range","Range Of Widths"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934656","title":"EmoCo: Visual Analysis of Emotion Coherence in Presentation Videos","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":41,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085732774","id":37085732774,"full_name":"Haipeng Zeng","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101987","id":37087101987,"full_name":"Xingbo Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086808853","id":37086808853,"full_name":"Aoyu Wu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085635207","id":37085635207,"full_name":"Yong Wang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"WeBank, AI Group, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085720737","id":37085720737,"full_name":"Quan Li","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["WeBank, AI Group, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681759500","id":37681759500,"full_name":"Alex Endert","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Emotions play a key role in human communication and public presentations. Human emotions are usually expressed through multiple modalities. Therefore, exploring multimodal emotions and their coherence is of great value for understanding emotional expressions in presentations and improving presentation skills. However, manually watching and studying presentation videos is often tedious and time-consuming. There is a lack of tool support to help conduct an efficient and in-depth multi-level analysis. Thus, in this paper, we introduce EmoCo, an interactive visual analytics system to facilitate efficient analysis of emotion coherence across facial, text, and audio modalities in presentation videos. Our visualization system features a channel coherence view and a sentence clustering view that together enable users to obtain a quick overview of emotion coherence and its temporal evolution. In addition, a detail view and word view enable detailed exploration and comparison from the sentence level and word level, respectively. We thoroughly evaluate the proposed system and visualization techniques through two usage scenarios based on TED Talk videos and interviews with two domain experts. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in gaining insights into emotion coherence in presentations.","article_number":"8807235","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8807235","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807235/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807235/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"927","end_page":"937","citing_paper_count":20,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1627,"insert_date":"20190820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Coherence","Videos","Feature extraction","Visual analytics","Emotion recognition","Face"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Emotion","coherence","video analysis","visual analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Coherence Analysis","In-depth Analysis","Visual System","Emotional Expressions","Multiple Modalities","Multiple Limitations","Multiple Transitions","Domain Experts","Detailed View","Visualization Techniques","Interactive Visualization","Word Level","Sentence Level","Usage Scenarios","Presentation Skills","Barcode","End-users","Facial Expressions","Disgust","Emotion Recognition","Emotional Faces","Video Views","Emotional Information","Middle Node","Emotional Changes","Emotion Categories","Emotion Classification","Degree Of Coherence","Emotion Type","Different Levels Of Detail","Presentation Style","Sankey Diagram","Sankey Plot"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934593","title":"Understanding the Role of Alternatives in Data Analysis Practices","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":42,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"LTCI, Télécom Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101208","id":37087101208,"full_name":"Jiali Liu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["LTCI, Télécom Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris"]}},{"affiliation":"INRA, Université Paris-Saclay","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37325862800","id":37325862800,"full_name":"Nadia Boukhelifa","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["INRA, Université Paris-Saclay"]}},{"affiliation":"LTCI, Télécom Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550755100","id":37550755100,"full_name":"James R.

They come from various domains and often need to explore diverse sets of hypotheses and theories, a variety of data sources, algorithms, methods, tools, and visual designs. Taken together, we call these alternatives. To better understand and characterize the role of alternatives in their analyses, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 data workers with different types of expertise. We conducted four types of analyses to understand 1) why data workers explore alternatives; 2) the different notions of alternatives and how they fit into the sensemaking process; 3) the high-level processes around alternatives; and 4) their strategies to generate, explore, and manage those alternatives. We find that participants' diverse levels of domain and computational expertise, experience with different tools, and collaboration within their broader context play an important role in how they explore these alternatives. These findings call out the need for more attention towards a deeper understanding of alternatives and the need for better tools to facilitate the exploration, interpretation, and management of alternatives. Drawing upon these analyses and findings, we present a framework based on participants' 1) degree of attention, 2) abstraction level, and 3) analytic processes. We show how this framework can help understand how data workers consider such alternatives in their analyses and how tool designers might create tools to better support them.","article_number":"8805460","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8805460","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805460/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805460/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"66","end_page":"76","citing_paper_count":20,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1059,"insert_date":"20190819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Tools","Data analysis","Analytical models","Computational modeling","Interviews","Task analysis","Data models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["alternatives","data workers","data analysis","data science","sensemaking","qualitative study"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Alternative Role","Level Of Abstraction","Level Of Expertise","Domain Experts","High-level Processing","Higher-level Processes","Higher-level Cognitive Processes","High-level Cognitive Processes","Visual Design","Sense-making Process","Types Of Expertise","Computational Expertise","Learning Algorithms","Machine Learning Algorithms","Specific Context","Cognitive Domains","Domain Knowledge","Past Experiences","Alternative Hypothesis","Reference Frame","Evolutionary Algorithms","Development Of Algorithms","Alternative Interpretation","Mental Models","Variety Of Disciplines","Diverse Disciplines","Alternative Analysis","Surrogate Analysis","Alternative Types","Design Domain","Scope Of Systems","Code Version","Abstraction Layer","Real-world Analysis","Role Of Experts","Scatterplot Matrix","Scatter Plot Matrix","Scatterplot Matrices","Exploration Path","Number Of Alternatives"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934798","title":"DeepDrawing: A Deep Learning Approach to Graph Drawing","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":43,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085635207","id":37085635207,"full_name":"Yong Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102162","id":37087102162,"full_name":"Zhihua Jin","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)","Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543277","id":37086543277,"full_name":"Qianwen Wang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37391623900","id":37391623900,"full_name":"Weiwei Cui","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia"]}},{"affiliation":"IBM T.

However, when using a graph drawing technique to visualize networks, users often need to tune different algorithm-specific parameters iteratively by comparing the corresponding drawing results in order to achieve a desired visual effect. This trial and error process is often tedious and time-consuming, especially for non-expert users. Inspired by the powerful data modelling and prediction capabilities of deep learning techniques, we explore the possibility of applying deep learning techniques to graph drawing. Specifically, we propose using a graph-LSTM-based approach to directly map network structures to graph drawings. Given a set of layout examples as the training dataset, we train the proposed graph-LSTM-based model to capture their layout characteristics. Then, the trained model is used to generate graph drawings in a similar style for new networks. We evaluated the proposed approach on two special types of layouts (i.e., grid layouts and star layouts) and two general types of layouts (i.e., ForceAtlas2 and PivotMDS) in both qualitative and quantitative ways. The results provide support for the effectiveness of our approach. We also conducted a time cost assessment on the drawings of small graphs with 20 to 50 nodes. We further report the lessons we learned and discuss the limitations and future work.","article_number":"8807275","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8807275","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807275/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807275/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"676","end_page":"686","citing_paper_count":19,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1606,"insert_date":"20190820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Deep learning","Layout","Neural networks","Training","Convolution","Data models","Visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Graph Drawing","Deep Learning","LSTM","Procrustes Analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Deep Learning","Deep Learning Approaches","Graph Layout","Graph Drawing","Training Dataset","Training Data Set","Time Cost","Deep Learning Techniques","Small Graphs","Grid Layout","Community Structure","Quantitative Evaluation","Deep Learning Models","Recurrent Neural Network","Baseline Methods","Baseline Method","Graph Structure","Graph Convolutional Network","Graph Convolutional Neural Network","Visual Properties","Visual Attributes","Graph Neural Networks","Graph Partitioning","Multilevel Techniques","Types Of Graphs","Grid Graph","Lattice Graph","LSTM Model","Sequence Of Nodes","Breadth-first Search","Breadth First Search","Breadth-first","Field Of Natural Language Processing","Input Graph","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory Model","Loss Function Design","Nodes In Order"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934400","title":"Biased Average Position Estimates in Line and Bar Graphs: Underestimation, Overestimation, and Perceptual Pull","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":44,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Northwestern University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102197","id":37087102197,"full_name":"Cindy Xiong","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northwestern University"]}},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087099982","id":37087099982,"full_name":"Cristina R.

Not only are other encodings less precise than position, but they can also be prone to systematic biases (e.g., color category boundaries can distort perceived differences between hues). By comparison, position's high level of precision may seem to protect it from such biases. In contrast, across three empirical studies, we show that while position may be a precise form of data encoding, it can also produce systematic biases in how values are visually encoded, at least for reports of average position across a short delay. In displays with a single line or a single set of bars, reports of average positions were significantly biased, such that line positions were underestimated and bar positions were overestimated. In displays with multiple data series (i.e., multiple lines and/or sets of bars), this systematic bias still persisted. We also observed an effect of “perceptual pull”, where the average position estimate for each series was `pulled' toward the other. These findings suggest that, although position may still be the most precise form of visual data encoding, it can also be systematically biased.","article_number":"8805427","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8805427","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805427/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805427/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"301","end_page":"310","citing_paper_count":18,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":896,"insert_date":"20190819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Bars","Data visualization","Visualization","Encoding","Systematics","Image color analysis","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Perceptual biases","perception and cognition","cue combination","bar graphs","line graphs","position estimation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Bar Graphs","Average Estimates","Average Approximation","Average Position","Average Location","Position Estimation","Attitude Estimation","Line Graph","Line Estimation","Data Visualization","Series Data","Systematic Bias","Systematic Biases","Line Positions","High Level Of Precision","Set Of Bars","True Positive","True-positive","Mixed-effects Model","Mixed Effects Model","Point Cloud","Point Clouds","Highest Point","Bottom Line","Anchoring Effect","Focusing Effect","Anchoring Bias","Effect Of Focus","Focal Events","Focusing Events","Half Of The Trials","Top Line","Complex Graph","Type Series","Top Bar","Perception Data","Display Type","Simple Graph","Top Of The Screen","Initial Probe","Initiator Probe","Average Perception"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934243","title":"CourtTime: Generating Actionable Insights into Tennis Matches Using Visual Analytics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":45,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085390137","id":37085390137,"full_name":"Tom Polk","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233561600","id":38233561600,"full_name":"Dominik Jäckle","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37542338000","id":37542338000,"full_name":"Johannes Häußler","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz"]}},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37292632600","id":37292632600,"full_name":"Jing Yang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of North Carolina"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Tennis players and coaches of all proficiency levels seek to understand and improve their play.

First, we investigate the sensitivity of scagnostics by employing perturbing operations on more than 60M synthetic and real-world scatterplots. We found that two scagnostic measures, Outlying and Clumpy, are overly sensitive to data binning. To understand how these measures align with human judgments of visual features, we conducted a study with 24 participants, which reveals that i) humans are not sensitive to small perturbations of the data that cause large changes in both measures, and ii) the perception of clumpiness heavily depends on per-cluster topologies and structures. Motivated by these results, we propose Robust Scagnostics (RScag) by combining adaptive binning with a hierarchy-based form of scagnostics. An analysis shows that RScag improves on the robustness of original scagnostics, aligns better with human judgments, and is equally fast as the traditional scagnostic measures.","article_number":"8807247","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8807247","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807247/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807247/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"759","end_page":"769","citing_paper_count":17,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":548,"insert_date":"20190820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Atmospheric measurements","Particle measurements","Sensitivity","Density measurement","Robustness","Perturbation methods"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Scagnostics","scatterplots","sensitivity analysis","Robust Scagnostics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Perturbation Theory","Higher Order Terms","Perturbation Analysis","Higher-order Terms","Small Perturbations","Visual Features","Visual Characteristics","Binary Data","Binary Values","Sensitivity Analysis","Error Rate","Hierarchical Clustering","Hierarchical Cluster Analysis","Quality Measures","Measurement Values","Cluster Size","User Study","Convex Hull","Dense Clusters","Compact Clusters","Leaf Node","Interior Point","Interior-point","Visual Patterns","Points In Cells","Studies In Human Subjects","Delaunay Triangulation","Binning Strategy","Binning Scheme","Davies-Bouldin Index","Davies Bouldin Index"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934788","title":"Data by Proxy — Material Traces as Autographic Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":47,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Northeastern University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086633060","id":37086633060,"full_name":"Dietmar Offenhuber","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Information visualization limits itself, per definition, to the domain of symbolic information. This paper discusses arguments why the field should also consider forms of data that are not symbolically encoded, including physical traces and material indicators. Continuing a provocation presented by Pat Hanrahan in his 2004 IEEE Vis capstone address, this paper compares physical traces to visualizations and describes the techniques and visual practices for producing, revealing, and interpreting them. By contrasting information visualization with a speculative counter model of autographic visualization, this paper examines the design principles for material data. Autographic visualization addresses limitations of information visualization, such as the inability to directly reflect the material circumstances of data generation. The comparison between the two models allows probing the epistemic assumptions behind information visualization and uncovers linkages with the rich history of scientific visualization and trace reading. The paper begins by discussing the gap between data visualizations and their corresponding phenomena and proceeds by investigating how material visualizations can bridge this gap. It contextualizes autographic visualization with paradigms such as data physicalization and indexical visualization and grounds it in the broader theoretical literature of semiotics, science and technology studies (STS), and the history of scientific representation. The main section of the paper proposes a foundational design vocabulary for autographic visualization and offers examples of how citizen scientists already use autographic principles in their displays, which seem to violate the canonical principles of information visualization but succeed at fulfilling other rhetorical purposes in evidence construction. The paper concludes with a discussion of the limitations of autographic visualization, a roadmap for the empirical investigation of trace perception, and thoughts about how information visualization and autographic visualization techniques can contribute to each other.","article_number":"8807292","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8807292","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807292/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807292/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"98","end_page":"108","citing_paper_count":17,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":924,"insert_date":"20190820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Data models","History","Semiotics","Ice","Indexes"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Traces","indexicality","data physicalization","proxy data sources","data materiality"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Material Traces","Rhetoric","Data Visualization","Visual Information","Citizen Science","Physicalism","Scientific Visualization","Pollution","Seismic","Earthquake","Design Space","Physical World","Experimentalists","Airborne Particles","Airborne Particulate Matter","Forensic Science","History Of Science","Wind Tunnel","Line Chart","Objects In The World","Ice Core","Ice-core","Traces Of Products","Rhetorical Strategies","Digital Sensor","Conception Of The World","Interpretation Of Symptoms","Sentinel Species","Visible Traces","Visual Phenomena","Visual Phenomenon","Fracking","Scientific Experiments"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934595","title":"Visual Interaction with Deep Learning Models through Collaborative Semantic Inference","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":48,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Harvard NLP group","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086235463","id":37086235463,"full_name":"Sebastian Gehrmann","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard NLP group","MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab."]}},{"affiliation":"IBM Research Cambridge","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38108845300","id":38108845300,"full_name":"Hendrik Strobelt","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IBM Research Cambridge","MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab."]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard Visual Computing group","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077786200","id":37077786200,"full_name":"Robert Krüger","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard Visual Computing group"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard Visual Computing group","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275698100","id":37275698100,"full_name":"Hanspeter Pfister","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard Visual Computing group"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard NLP group","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086236961","id":37086236961,"full_name":"Alexander M.

Deep learning models are particularly susceptible since current black-box approaches lack explainable reasoning.

We propose a framework of collaborative semantic inference (CSI) for the co-design of interactions and models to enable visual collaboration between humans and algorithms. The approach exposes the intermediate reasoning process of models which allows semantic interactions with the visual metaphors of a problem, which means that a user can both understand and control parts of the model reasoning process.

Given a set of scalar fields, our approach enables the computation of a persistence diagram which is representative of the set, and which visually conveys the number, data ranges and saliences of the main features of interest found in the set. Such representative diagrams are obtained by computing explicitly the discrete Wasserstein barycenter of the set of persistence diagrams, a notoriously computationally intensive task. In particular, we revisit efficient algorithms for Wasserstein distance approximation [12,51] to extend previous work on barycenter estimation [94]. We present a new fast algorithm, which progressively approximates the barycenter by iteratively increasing the computation accuracy as well as the number of persistent features in the output diagram. Such a progressivity drastically improves convergence in practice and allows to design an interruptible algorithm, capable of respecting computation time constraints. This enables the approximation of Wasserstein barycenters within interactive times. We present an application to ensemble clustering where we revisit the k-means algorithm to exploit our barycenters and compute, within execution time constraints, meaningful clusters of ensemble data along with their barycenter diagram. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-life data sets report that our algorithm converges to barycenters that are qualitatively meaningful with regard to the applications, and quantitatively comparable to previous techniques, while offering an order of magnitude speedup when run until convergence (without time constraint). Our algorithm can be trivially parallelized to provide additional speedups in practice on standard workstations. We provide a lightweight C++ implementation of our approach that can be used to reproduce our results.","article_number":"8794517","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8794517","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8794517/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8794517/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"151","end_page":"161","citing_paper_count":16,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":445,"insert_date":"20190812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Market research","Approximation algorithms","Clustering algorithms","Measurement","Time factors","Uncertainty"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Topological data analysis","scalar data","ensemble data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Persistence Diagram","Time Constraints","Interesting Feature","Interesting Characteristics","Persistent Features","Persistent Characteristics","Means Algorithm","Ensemble Data","Real-life Datasets","Real-life Data Sets","C++ Implementation","Practical Convergence","Ensemble Clustering","Optimization Problem","Centroid","Critical Point","Interest For Applications","Global Trends","Point Cloud","Point Clouds","Interesting Data","Previous Iteration","Early Iterations","Bidding","Ensemble Members","Topological Data Analysis","Optimal Assignment","Topological Clusters","Iterative Clustering","Distance Estimation","Sea Surface Height","Mean Dynamic Topography","Assignment Problem"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934263","title":"R-Map: A Map Metaphor for Visualizing Information Reposting Process in Social Media","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":51,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), School of EECS, Peking University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086146756","id":37086146756,"full_name":"Shuai Chen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), School of EECS, Peking University"]}},{"affiliation":"Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), School of EECS, Peking University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087099711","id":37087099711,"full_name":"Sihang Li","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), School of EECS, Peking University"]}},{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer Institute IAIS, University of Bonn","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085387892","id":37085387892,"full_name":"Siming Chen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute IAIS, University of Bonn"]}},{"affiliation":"Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), School of EECS, Peking University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403856700","id":37403856700,"full_name":"Xiaoru Yuan","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), School of EECS, Peking University","National Engineering Laboratory for Big Data Analysis and Application, Peking University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We propose R-Map (Reposting Map), a visual analytical approach with a map metaphor to support interactive exploration and analysis of the information reposting process in social media.

Such reposting behaviors form the reposting tree, in which a node represents a message and a link represents the reposting relation. In R-Map, the reposting tree structure can be spatialized with highlighted key players and tiled nodes. The important reposting behaviors, the following relations and the semantics relations are represented as rivers, routes and bridges, respectively, in a virtual geographical space. R-Map supports a scalable overview of a large number of information repostings with semantics.

However, due to the high noise in the deluge of data, effectively determining semantically relevant information can be difficult, further complicated by the changing definition of relevancy by each end user for different events. The majority of existing methods for short text relevance classification fail to incorporate users' knowledge into the classification process. Existing methods that incorporate interactive user feedback focus on historical datasets. Therefore, classifiers cannot be interactively retrained for specific events or user-dependent needs in real-time. This limits real-time situational awareness, as streaming data that is incorrectly classified cannot be corrected immediately, permitting the possibility for important incoming data to be incorrectly classified as well. We present a novel interactive learning framework to improve the classification process in which the user iteratively corrects the relevancy of tweets in real-time to train the classification model on-the-fly for immediate predictive improvements. We computationally evaluate our classification model adapted to learn at interactive rates. Our results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning models. In addition, we integrate our framework with the extended Social Media Analytics and Reporting Toolkit (SMART) 2.0 system, allowing the use of our interactive learning framework within a visual analytics system tailored for real-time situational awareness. To demonstrate our framework's effectiveness, we provide domain expert feedback from first responders who used the extended SMART 2.0 system.","article_number":"8807283","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8807283","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807283/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807283/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"558","end_page":"568","citing_paper_count":16,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1363,"insert_date":"20190820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Real-time systems","Social networking (online)","Computational modeling","Visual analytics","Machine learning","Adaptation models","Training"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Interactive machine learning","human-computer interaction","social media analytics","emergency/disaster management","situational awareness"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive Learning","Situational Awareness","Relevant Tweets","Real-time Situational Awareness","Machine Learning","Machine-learning","Social Media","Social Platforms","Specific Effects","Specific Events","Learning Models","Machine Learning Models","Visual Analysis","Real-time Data","Data Streams","Domain Experts","Social Media Data","Social Media Analytics","User Feedback","Short Text","Historical Dataset","Historical Data Sets","Interactive Framework","Relevant Definitions","Neural Network","Convolutional Neural Network Model","Long Short-term Memory Model","Long Short-term Memory","Long Short Term Memory","LSTM","Training Iterations","Convolutional Neural Network","Recurrent Neural Network","Term Frequency-inverse Document Frequency","Inverse Document Frequency","TF-IDF","Hurricane","Tropical Cyclones","Crisis Prevention","Dataset Of Tweets","Data Set Of Tweets"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934266","title":"VASSL: A Visual Analytics Toolkit for Social Spambot Labeling","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":54,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100488","id":37087100488,"full_name":"Mosab Khayat","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Colorado Boulder","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089053323","id":37089053323,"full_name":"Morteza Karimzadeh","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Colorado Boulder"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085454267","id":37085454267,"full_name":"Jieqiong Zhao","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282598900","id":37282598900,"full_name":"David S.

However, these simulation models tend to be computationally very expensive and involve a large number of simulation input parameters, which need to be analyzed and properly calibrated before the models can be applied for real scientific studies. We propose a visual analysis system to facilitate interactive exploratory analysis of high-dimensional input parameter space for a complex yeast cell polarization simulation. The proposed system can assist the computational biologists, who designed the simulation model, to visually calibrate the input parameters by modifying the parameter values and immediately visualizing the predicted simulation outcome without having the need to run the original expensive simulation for every instance. Our proposed visual analysis system is driven by a trained neural network-based surrogate model as the backend analysis framework. In this work, we demonstrate the advantage of using neural networks as surrogate models for visual analysis by incorporating some of the recent advances in the field of uncertainty quantification, interpretability and explainability of neural network-based models. We utilize the trained network to perform interactive parameter sensitivity analysis of the original simulation as well as recommend optimal parameter configurations using the activation maximization framework of neural networks. We also facilitate detail analysis of the trained network to extract useful insights about the simulation model, learned by the network, during the training process. We performed two case studies, and discovered multiple new parameter configurations, which can trigger high cell polarization results in the original simulation model. We evaluated our results by comparing with the original simulation model outcomes as well as the findings from previous parameter analysis performed by our experts.","article_number":"8805421","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8805421","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805421/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805421/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"34","end_page":"44","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1001,"insert_date":"20190819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Analytical models","Computational modeling","Visualization","Biological system modeling","Neural networks","Machine learning","Data models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Surrogate modeling","Neural networks","Computational biology","Visual analysis","Parameter analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Neural Network","Cell Polarity","Visual Analysis","Yeast Cell Polarization","Sensitivity Analysis","Simulation Model","Analytical Framework","Alternative Models","Surrogate Model","Interaction Analysis","Input Parameters","Visual System","Parameter Space","Neural Model","Network Training","Parameter Sensitivity","High Polarity","Configuration Parameters","Uncertainty Quantification","Parameter Sensitivity Analysis","Network-based Model","Neurons In Layer","Membrane Regions","Dimension Of The Input Vector","Weight Matrix","Weight Matrices","Maximum Concentration Values","Hidden Layer","Degree Of Polarization","Scientific Visualization","Analysis Tasks","High-level View"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934613","title":"CloudDet: Interactive Visual Analysis of Anomalous Performances in Cloud Computing Systems","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":57,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086887730","id":37086887730,"full_name":"Ke Xu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086545328","id":37086545328,"full_name":"Yun Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102860","id":37087102860,"full_name":"Leni Yang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102546","id":37087102546,"full_name":"Yifang Wang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087099740","id":37087099740,"full_name":"Bo Qiao","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102704","id":37087102704,"full_name":"Si Qin","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088729964","id":37088729964,"full_name":"Yong Xu","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073639100","id":37073639100,"full_name":"Haidong Zhang","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":9,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Detecting and analyzing potential anomalous performances in cloud computing systems is essential for avoiding losses to customers and ensuring the efficient operation of the systems. To this end, a variety of automated techniques have been developed to identify anomalies in cloud computing. These techniques are usually adopted to track the performance metrics of the system (e.g., CPU, memory, and disk I/O), represented by a multivariate time series. However, given the complex characteristics of cloud computing data, the effectiveness of these automated methods is affected. Thus, substantial human judgment on the automated analysis results is required for anomaly interpretation. In this paper, we present a unified visual analytics system named CloudDet to interactively detect, inspect, and diagnose anomalies in cloud computing systems. A novel unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm is developed to identify anomalies based on the specific temporal patterns of the given metrics data (e.g., the periodic pattern). Rich visualization and interaction designs are used to help understand the anomalies in the spatial and temporal context. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CloudDet through a quantitative evaluation, two case studies with real-world data, and interviews with domain experts.","article_number":"8807232","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8807232","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807232/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807232/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"1107","end_page":"1117","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1060,"insert_date":"20190820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Cloud computing","Data visualization","Anomaly detection","Measurement","Time series analysis","Visualization","Principal component analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Cloud computing","anomaly detection","multidimensional data","performance visualization","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Cloud Computing","Cloud Storage","Cloud-based","Cloud Server","Cloud Computing System","Time Series","Time-series","Spatial Patterns","Spatiotemporal Patterns","Temporal Patterns","Performance Metrics","Quantitative Evaluation","Real-world Data","Domain Experts","Anomaly Detection","Unsupervised Algorithm","Temporal Context","Multivariate Time Series","Multivariate Time-series","Univariate Time Series","Interaction Design","Visual Design","Rich Interactions","Raw Data","Data Center","Data Clustering","Multivariate Data","Multivariate Statistics","Trends Data","Anomaly Score","Cluster Nodes","CPU Usage","Memory Usage","Cloud System","Cloud Data","Word Cloud","Word Clouds","Visualization Techniques","Pattern Of Anomalies","Line Chart","Color Scheme","Colour Scheme"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934541","title":"A Recursive Subdivision Technique for Sampling Multi-class Scatterplots","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":58,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Shandong University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543204","id":37086543204,"full_name":"Xin Chen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shandong University"]}},{"affiliation":"Shandong University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547501","id":37086547501,"full_name":"Tong Ge","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shandong University"]}},{"affiliation":"CNIC, CAS","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38026660700","id":38026660700,"full_name":"Jian Zhang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["CNIC, CAS"]}},{"affiliation":"Peking University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37600013700","id":37600013700,"full_name":"Baoquan Chen","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Peking University"]}},{"affiliation":"Chinese University of Hong Kong, Guangdong Prov.

One approach to highlighting these relations is to explicitly encode the numeric differences (deltas) between data values. Because this approach removes the context of the individual data values, it is important to measure how much of a performance improvement it actually offers, especially across differences in encodings and tasks, to ensure that it is worth adding to a visualization design. Across 3 different tasks, we measured the increase in visual processing efficiency for judging the relations between pairs of data values, from when only the values were shown, to when the deltas between the values were explicitly encoded, across position and length visual feature encodings (and slope encodings in Experiments 1 & 2). In Experiment 1, the participant's task was to locate a pair of data values with a given relation (e.g., Find the `small bar to the left of a tall bar' pair) among pairs of the opposite relation, and we measured processing efficiency from the increase in response times as the number of pairs increased. In Experiment 2, the task was to judge which of two relation types was more prevalent in a briefly presented display of 10 data pairs (e.g., Are there more `small bar to the left of a tall bar' pairs or more `tall bar to the left of a small bar' pairs?). In the final experiment, the task was to estimate the average delta within a briefly presented display of 6 data pairs (e.g., What is the average bar height difference across all `small bar to the left of a tall bar' pairs?). Across all three experiments, visual processing of relations between data value pairs was significantly better when directly encoded as deltas rather than implicitly between individual data points, and varied substantially depending on the task (improvement ranged from 25% to 95%). Considering the ubiquity of bar charts and dot plots, relation perception for individual data values is highly inefficient, and confirms the need for alternative designs that provide not only absolute values, but also direct encoding of critical relationships between those values.","article_number":"8836120","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8836120","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8836120/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8836120/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"311","end_page":"320","citing_paper_count":14,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":431,"insert_date":"20190913","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Encoding","Task analysis","Bars","Visualization","Data visualization","Time factors"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Information visualization","marks","perception","attention","visual comparison","visual search","aggregation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Paired Data","Direct Encoding","Response Time","Individual Data","Average Deviation","Average Difference","Data Visualization","Visual Processing","Pairs Of Values","Bar Charts","Dot Plots","Opposite Relationship","Reverse Relationship","Individual Data Points","Visual Design","Increase In Response Time","Bar Height","Height Of Each Bar","Small Bars","Low Values","Pairing","Cardinality","Set Size","Visual Task","Positional Encoding","Delta Values","Visual Degrees","Visual Search","Visual Scanning","Visual Search Task","Center Of The Screen","Design Techniques","Goal Of Experiment","Goal Of These Experiments","Individual Slopes"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934208","title":"Evaluating Perceptual Bias During Geometric Scaling of Scatterplots","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":60,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"The State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100051","id":37087100051,"full_name":"Yating Wei","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"The State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085541429","id":37085541429,"full_name":"Honghui Mei","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085336513","id":37085336513,"full_name":"Ying Zhao","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"]}},{"affiliation":"The State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102451","id":37087102451,"full_name":"Shuyue Zhou","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"The State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087099848","id":37087099848,"full_name":"Bingru Lin","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102501","id":37087102501,"full_name":"Haojing Jiang","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"]}},{"affiliation":"The State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37291847800","id":37291847800,"full_name":"Wei Chen","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Scatterplots are frequently scaled to fit display areas in multi-view and multi-device data analysis environments. A common method used for scaling is to enlarge or shrink the entire scatterplot together with the inside points synchronously and proportionally. This process is called geometric scaling. However, geometric scaling of scatterplots may cause a perceptual bias, that is, the perceived and physical values of visual features may be dissociated with respect to geometric scaling. For example, if a scatterplot is projected from a laptop to a large projector screen, then observers may feel that the scatterplot shown on the projector has fewer points than that viewed on the laptop. This paper presents an evaluation study on the perceptual bias of visual features in scatterplots caused by geometric scaling. The study focuses on three fundamental visual features (i.e., numerosity, correlation, and cluster separation) and three hypotheses that are formulated on the basis of our experience. We carefully design three controlled experiments by using well-prepared synthetic data and recruit participants to complete the experiments on the basis of their subjective experience. With a detailed analysis of the experimental results, we obtain a set of instructive findings. First, geometric scaling causes a bias that has a linear relationship with the scale ratio. Second, no significant difference exists between the biases measured from normally and uniformly distributed scatterplots. Third, changing the point radius can correct the bias to a certain extent. These findings can be used to inspire the design decisions of scatterplots in various scenarios.","article_number":"8794768","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8794768","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8794768/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8794768/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"321","end_page":"331","citing_paper_count":14,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1007,"insert_date":"20190812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Correlation","Data analysis","Encoding","Measurement","Portable computers","Mobile handsets"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Evaluation","scatterplot","geometric scaling","bias","perceptual consistency"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Perceptual Bias","Perceptual Biases","Geometric Scaling","Uniform Distribution","Subjective Experience","Visual Features","Visual Characteristics","Measurement Bias","Measurement Biases","Ratio Scale","Normal Distribution","Gaussian Distribution","Aspect Ratio","Point Cloud","Point Clouds","Experimental Variables","Friedman Test","Axis Length","Axis Lengths","Latin Square","Participation Bias","Immersive Environment","Subjective Questionnaire","Round Of Experiments","Adjacent Levels","Point Of Subjective Equality","Choice Patterns","Silhouette Index","Silhouette Indices","Visual Encoding","Order Of Appearance","Large Numerosities","Large Multiplication","Large Multiplicity","Display Size","Amount Of Points","Quantity Of Points","Arithmetic Sum","Arithmetic Series","Experimental Task"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934799","title":"Data Sampling in Multi-view and Multi-class Scatterplots via Set Cover Optimization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":61,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Shenzhen University, Visual Computing Research Center, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102312","id":37087102312,"full_name":"Ruizhen Hu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shenzhen University, Visual Computing Research Center, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Shenzhen University, Visual Computing Research Center, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102561","id":37087102561,"full_name":"Tingkai Sha","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shenzhen University, Visual Computing Research Center, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Carleton University, School of Computer Science, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101740","id":37087101740,"full_name":"Oliver Van Kaick","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Carleton University, School of Computer Science, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"Konstanz University, Germany and Shenzhen VisuCA Key Lab, SIAT, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266781000","id":37266781000,"full_name":"Oliver Deussen","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Konstanz University, Germany and Shenzhen VisuCA Key Lab, SIAT, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Shenzhen University, Visual Computing Research Center, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086110259","id":37086110259,"full_name":"Hui Huang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shenzhen University, Visual Computing Research Center, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present a method for data sampling in scatterplots by jointly optimizing point selection for different views or classes. Our method uses space-filling curves (Z-order curves) that partition a point set into subsets that, when covered each by one sample, provide a sampling or coreset with good approximation guarantees in relation to the original point set. For scatterplot matrices with multiple views, different views provide different space-filling curves, leading to different partitions of the given point set. For multi-class scatterplots, the focus on either per-class distribution or global distribution provides two different partitions of the given point set that need to be considered in the selection of the coreset. For both cases, we convert the coreset selection problem into an Exact Cover Problem (ECP), and demonstrate with quantitative and qualitative evaluations that an approximate solution that solves the ECP efficiently is able to provide high-quality samplings.","article_number":"8807244","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8807244","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807244/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807244/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"739","end_page":"748","citing_paper_count":14,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":752,"insert_date":"20190820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Sampling methods","Visualization","Optimization","Kernel","Two dimensional displays","Image color analysis","Measurement"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Sampling","Scatterplot","SPLOM","Exact Cover Problem"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Set Of Covariates","Sampling Method","Sampling Methods","Quantitative Evaluation","Global Distribution","Original Point","Coverage Problem","Scatterplot Matrix","Scatter Plot Matrix","Scatterplot Matrices","Exact Problem","Random Sampling","Distribution Of Types","Relative Density","Specific Gravity","User Study","Lower Error","Distribution Of Points","Global View","Directions For Future Work","Original Distribution","Set Of Data Points","Points In The Dataset","Marked Regions","User Performance","Local View","Set Cover Problem","Quadtree","Subset Of Points","Regional Plots","Specific View","Query Point","Static Sampling","Class Separation","Kernel Function"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934286","title":"Toward Objective Evaluation of Working Memory in Visualizations: A Case Study Using Pupillometry and a Dual-Task Paradigm","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":62,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of California Merced in Cognitive + Information Sciences","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085907327","id":37085907327,"full_name":"Lace M.K.

The lack of information visualization research that uses validated procedures for measuring working memory may be due, in part, to the absence of cross-domain methodological guidance tailored explicitly to the unique needs of visualization research. This paper presents a set of clear, practical, and empirically validated methods for evaluating working memory during visualization tasks and provides readers with guidance in selecting an appropriate working memory evaluation paradigm. As a case study, we illustrate multiple methods for evaluating working memory in a visual-spatial aggregation task with geospatial data. The results show that the use of dual-task experimental designs (simultaneous performance of several tasks compared to single-task performance) and pupil dilation can reveal working memory demands associated with task difficulty and dual-tasking. In a dual-task experimental design, measures of task completion times and pupillometry revealed the working memory demands associated with both task difficulty and dual-tasking. Pupillometry demonstrated that participants' pupils were significantly larger when they were completing a more difficult task and when multitasking. We propose that researchers interested in the relative differences in working memory between visualizations should consider a converging methods approach, where physiological measures and behavioral measures of working memory are employed to generate a rich evaluation of visualization effort.","article_number":"8805430","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8805430","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805430/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805430/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"332","end_page":"342","citing_paper_count":14,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1099,"insert_date":"20190819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Task analysis","Data visualization","Memory management","Visualization","Sociology","Statistics","Cognitive science"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Working Memory","Cognitive Effort","Evaluation Methods","Pupillometry","Geographic/Geospatial Visualization","Quantitative Evaluation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Working Memory","Pupillometry","Dual-task Paradigm","Scientific Knowledge","Cognitive Science","Difficult Task","Visual Task","Task Difficulty","Pupil Size","Pupil Dilation","Mydriasis","Vision Research","Working Memory Measures","Task Completion Time","Working Memory Demands","Working-memory Demands","Accurate Measurement","Group Of Individuals","Hierarchical Regression","Multilevel Analysis","Multilevel Models","Hierarchical Multiple Regression","Cognitive Load","Cognitive Demands","Mental Workload","Mental Effort","Spatial Memory","Spatial Working Memory","Spatial Learning","Digital Elevation Model","Digital Terrain Model","Digital Surface Model","Working Memory Task","Speed Measurement","Primary Task","Dual-task Costs","Secondary Task","Easy Trials","Pupil Diameter","Hard Task","Working Memory Load","Spatial Task","Variation In Accuracy","Spatial Memory Task"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934666","title":"You can't always sketch what you want: Understanding Sensemaking in Visual Query Systems","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":63,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of California, Berkeley","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101728","id":37087101728,"full_name":"Doris Jung-Lin Lee","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Berkeley"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100474","id":37087100474,"full_name":"John Lee","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102222","id":37087102222,"full_name":"Tarique Siddiqui","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102881","id":37087102881,"full_name":"Jaewoo Kim","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37659362900","id":37659362900,"full_name":"Karrie Karahalios","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Berkeley","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38251863000","id":38251863000,"full_name":"Aditya Parameswaran","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Berkeley"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Visual query systems (VQSs) empower users to interactively search for line charts with desired visual patterns, typically specified using intuitive sketch-based interfaces. Despite decades of past work on VQSs, these efforts have not translated to adoption in practice, possibly because VQSs are largely evaluated in unrealistic lab-based settings. To remedy this gap in adoption, we collaborated with experts from three diverse domains-astronomy, genetics, and material science-via a year-long user-centered design process to develop a VQS that supports their workflow and analytical needs, and evaluate how VQSs can be used in practice. Our study results reveal that ad-hoc sketch-only querying is not as commonly used as prior work suggests, since analysts are often unable to precisely express their patterns of interest. In addition, we characterize three essential sensemaking processes supported by our enhanced VQS. We discover that participants employ all three processes, but in different proportions, depending on the analytical needs in each domain. Our findings suggest that all three sensemaking processes must be integrated in order to make future VQSs useful for a wide range of analytical inquiries.","article_number":"8807280","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8807280","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807280/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807280/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"1267","end_page":"1277","citing_paper_count":13,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":610,"insert_date":"20190820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Data visualization","Interviews","User centered design","Taxonomy","Buildings","Pattern matching"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","exploratory analysis","visual queries"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Query","Interactive","Design Process","Visual System","Materials Science","Past Work","Variety Of Domains","Diverse Domains","User-centered","Human-centered Design","User-centered Design","Line Chart","Sense-making Process","Prototype","Exploratory Data","Object Of Interest","Analysis Tasks","Top-down Processes","Pattern Matching","Bottom-up Processes","Participatory Design","User Design","Astronomers","Degree Of Approximation","Estimation Of The Degree","Usage Scenarios","Visual Interface","Scientific Goals","Analysis Workflow","Light Curves","Collaborative Design","External Tools","House Prices"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934259","title":"OpenSpace: A System for Astrographics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":64,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Linköping University, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489536800","id":38489536800,"full_name":"Alexander Bock","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Linköping University, University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"Linköping University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399690600","id":37399690600,"full_name":"Emil Axelsson","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Linköping University"]}},{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102777","id":37087102777,"full_name":"Jonathas Costa","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088736417","id":37088736417,"full_name":"Gene Payne","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"American Museum of Natural History","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088745059","id":37088745059,"full_name":"Micah Acinapura","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["American Museum of Natural History"]}},{"affiliation":"American Museum of Natural History","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088727542","id":37088727542,"full_name":"Vivian Trakinski","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["American Museum of Natural History"]}},{"affiliation":"American Museum of Natural History","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085747250","id":37085747250,"full_name":"Carter Emmart","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["American Museum of Natural History"]}},{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275249200","id":37275249200,"full_name":"Cláudio Silva","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266777200","id":37266777200,"full_name":"Charles Hansen","author_order":9,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"Linköping University, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284192000","id":37284192000,"full_name":"Anders Ynnerman","author_order":10,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Linköping University, University of Utah"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Human knowledge about the cosmos is rapidly increasing as instruments and simulations are generating new data supporting the formation of theory and understanding of the vastness and complexity of the universe.

The ambition is to support research in astronomy and space exploration, science communication at museums and in planetariums as well as bringing exploratory astrographics to the class room. There is a multitude of challenges that need to be met in reaching this goal such as the data variety, multiple spatio-temporal scales, collaboration capabilities, etc. Furthermore, the system has to be flexible and modular to enable rapid prototyping and inclusion of new research results or space mission data and thereby shorten the time from discovery to dissemination. To support the different use cases the system has to be hardware agnostic and support a range of platforms and interaction paradigms.

We present results from a crowdsourced graphical perception study where we asked workers to make perceptual judgments on a series of trials involving four graphical objects under the influence of conflicting static and dynamic visual factors (position, size and luminance) used in conjunction. Our results yield the following rankings for visual grouping: motion> (dynamic luminance, size, luminance); dynamic size> (dynamic luminance, position); and dynamic luminance > size. We also conducted a follow-up experiment to evaluate the three dynamic visual factors in a more ecologically valid setting, using both a Gapminder-like animated scatterplot and a thematic map of election data. The results indicate that in practice the relative grouping strengths of these factors may depend on various parameters including the visualization characteristics and the underlying data.

Prior work has compared geo-temporal visualization techniques for a single thematic variable that evolves over space and time, or for two variables at a specific point in time. But how effective visualization techniques are at communicating correlation between two variables that evolve over space and time remains to be investigated. We report on a study comparing three techniques that are representative of different strategies to visualize geo-temporal multivariate data: either juxtaposing all locations for a given time step, or juxtaposing all time steps for a given location; and encoding thematic attributes either using symbols overlaid on top of map features, or using visual channels of the map features themselves. Participants performed a series of tasks that required them to identify if two variables were correlated over time and if there was a pattern in their evolution. Tasks varied in granularity for both dimensions: time (all time steps, a subrange of steps, one step only) and space (all locations, locations in a subregion, one location only). Our results show that a visualization's effectiveness depends strongly on the task to be carried out. Based on these findings we present a set of design guidelines about geo-temporal visualization techniques for communicating correlation.","article_number":"8809223","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8809223","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8809223/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8809223/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"375","end_page":"385","citing_paper_count":13,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1160,"insert_date":"20190821","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Encoding","Correlation","Task analysis","Animation","Shape"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["geo-temporal data","bivariate maps","correlation","controlled study","bar chart","Dorling cartogram","small multiples"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Time And Space","Spacetime","Over Space","Hyperspace","Time Step","Birth Rate","Fertility Rate","Feature Maps","Visual Representation","Multivariate Data","Multivariate Statistics","Feature Channels","Channel Characteristics","Visualization Techniques","Life Expectancy At Birth","Visual Channels","Time Interval","Error Rate","Geographic Regions","Spatial Information","Number Of Steps","Temporal Evolution","Temporal Development","Spatial Dimensions","Spatial Attributes","Combination Of Strategies","Single Map","Time Granularity","Bar Charts","Number Of Time Steps","Number Of Timesteps","Visual Encoding","Completion Time","Single Time Point","Single Time-point","Choropleth Maps","Self-reported Confidence","Main Trial"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934800","title":"RSATree: Distribution-Aware Data Representation of Large-Scale Tabular Datasets for Flexible Visual Query","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":68,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"The State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085541429","id":37085541429,"full_name":"Honghui Mei","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"The State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37291847800","id":37291847800,"full_name":"Wei Chen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"The State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100051","id":37087100051,"full_name":"Yating Wei","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"The State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100719","id":37087100719,"full_name":"Yuanzhe Hu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102451","id":37087102451,"full_name":"Shuyue Zhou","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University"]}},{"affiliation":"The State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087099848","id":37087099848,"full_name":"Bingru Lin","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085336513","id":37085336513,"full_name":"Ying Zhao","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37531405500","id":37531405500,"full_name":"Jiazhi Xia","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Analysts commonly investigate the data distributions derived from statistical aggregations of data that are represented by charts, such as histograms and binned scatterplots, to visualize and analyze a large-scale dataset. Aggregate queries are implicitly executed through such a process. Datasets are constantly extremely large; thus, the response time should be accelerated by calculating predefined data cubes. However, the queries are limited to the predefined binning schema of preprocessed data cubes. Such limitation hinders analysts' flexible adjustment of visual specifications to investigate the implicit patterns in the data effectively. Particularly, RSATree enables arbitrary queries and flexible binning strategies by leveraging three schemes, namely, an R-tree-based space partitioning scheme to catch the data distribution, a locality-sensitive hashing technique to achieve locality-preserving random access to data items, and a summed area table scheme to support interactive query of aggregated values with a linear computational complexity. This study presents and implements a web-based visual query system that supports visual specification, query, and exploration of large-scale tabular data with user-adjustable granularities. We demonstrate the efficiency and utility of our approach by performing various experiments on real-world datasets and analyzing time and space complexity.","article_number":"8807303","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8807303","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807303/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807303/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"1161","end_page":"1171","citing_paper_count":13,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":722,"insert_date":"20190820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Data visualization","Aggregates","Histograms","Time factors","Visual databases","Social networking (online)"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Aggregate query","visual query","large-scale data visualization","R-tree","summed area table","hashing"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Large-scale Datasets","Large-scale Data Sets","Tabular Datasets","Tabular Data Set","Visual Query","Flexible Query","Data Distribution","Response Time","Time Complexity","Real-world Datasets","Real-world Data Sets","Space Complexity","Memory Complexity","Flexible Strategy","Flexible Scheme","Spatial Partitioning","Partition Of Space","Aggregate Value","Visual Exploration","Data Cube","Datacube","Binning Strategy","Binning Scheme","Locality Sensitive Hashing","Locality-sensitive Hashing","Exploratory Analysis","Exploratory Data Analysis","Time Constant","Skewed Distribution","Descriptive Characteristics","Feature Descriptors","Range Query","Average Relative Error","Computational Grid","Calculation Grid","Finer Granularity","Efficient Exploration","Query Performance","Data Space","High-dimensional Datasets","High-dimensional Data Sets","Usage Scenarios","Low Response Time"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934802","title":"Persistent Homology Guided Force-Directed Graph Layouts","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":69,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of South Florida, Tufts University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087099716","id":37087099716,"full_name":"Ashley Suh","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of South Florida, Tufts University"]}},{"affiliation":"Ohio State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086387683","id":37086387683,"full_name":"Mustafa Hajij","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Ohio State University"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38025846900","id":38025846900,"full_name":"Bei Wang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Arizona","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550809300","id":37550809300,"full_name":"Carlos Scheidegger","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Arizona"]}},{"affiliation":"University of South Florida","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37398611400","id":37398611400,"full_name":"Paul Rosen","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of South Florida"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Graphs are commonly used to encode relationships among entities, yet their abstractness makes them difficult to analyze.

We first discuss how to efficiently extract 0-dimensional persistent homology features from both weighted and unweighted undirected graphs. We then introduce the interactive persistence barcode used to manipulate the force-directed graph layout. In particular, the user adds and removes contracting and repulsing forces generated by the persistent homology features, eventually selecting the set of persistent homology features that most improve the layout.

New tools and algorithms to support ABR include front-end applets for constructing artifact-based colormaps, optimizing 3D scanned meshes for use in data visualization, and synthesizing textures from artifacts. These are complemented by an interactive rendering engine with custom algorithms and interfaces that demonstrate multiple new visual styles for depicting point, line, surface, and volume data.

With the advent of industry 4.0, plenty of data recording the status of factory resources have been collected and further involved in production planning, which brings an unprecedented opportunity to understand, evaluate and adjust complex production plans through a data-driven approach. However, developing a systematic analytics approach for production planning is challenging due to the large volume of production data, the complex dependency between products, and unexpected changes in the market and the plant. Previous studies only provide summarized results and fail to show details for comparative analysis of production plans. Besides, the rapid adjustment to the plan in the case of an unanticipated incident is also not supported. In this paper, we propose PlanningVis, a visual analytics system to support the exploration and comparison of production plans with three levels of details: a plan overview presenting the overall difference between plans, a product view visualizing various properties of individual products, and a production detail view displaying the product dependency and the daily production details in related factories. By integrating an automatic planning algorithm with interactive visual explorations, PlanningVis can facilitate the efficient optimization of daily production planning as well as support a quick response to unanticipated incidents in manufacturing. Two case studies with real-world data and carefully designed interviews with domain experts demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of PlanningVis.","article_number":"8805466","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8805466","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805466/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805466/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"579","end_page":"589","citing_paper_count":11,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1824,"insert_date":"20190819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Production facilities","Task analysis","Optimization","Manufacturing","Raw materials"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Production Planning","Time Series Data","Comparative Analysis","Visual Analytics","Smart Factory","Industry 4.0"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Production Planning","Smart Manufacturing","Smart Factory","Interactive","Raw Materials","Feedstock","Visual System","Manufacturing Industry","Industrial Manufacturing","Domain Experts","Optimal Production","Market Changes","Advanced Industrial","Industrial Promotion","Advanced Industries","Industry Promotion","Planning Algorithm","Automated Planning","Planning Software","Performance Indicators","Performance Index","Time Series Data","Time-series Data","Plant Productivity","Production Capacity","Manufacturing Capacity","Market Demand","Bar Charts","Visual Approach","Unanticipated Changes","Visual Design","Control Panel","Factory Production","Inventory Costs","Supply Of Raw Materials","Line Chart","Different Levels Of Detail","Planning Problem","Production Task"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934661","title":"Visual Analysis of High-Dimensional Event Sequence Data via Dynamic Hierarchical Aggregation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":73,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Information and Library Science, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601397400","id":37601397400,"full_name":"David Gotz","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Information and Library Science, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill"]}},{"affiliation":"Dept. of Biostatistics, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101747","id":37087101747,"full_name":"Jonathan Zhang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Dept. of Biostatistics, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Information and Library Science, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086596233","id":37086596233,"full_name":"Wenyuan Wang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Information and Library Science, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill"]}},{"affiliation":"Dept. of Computer Science, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102342","id":37087102342,"full_name":"Joshua Shrestha","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill"]}},{"affiliation":"RENCI, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295624700","id":37295624700,"full_name":"David Borland","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["RENCI, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Temporal event data are collected across a broad range of domains, and a variety of visual analytics techniques have been developed to empower analysts working with this form of data. These techniques generally display aggregate statistics computed over sets of event sequences that share common patterns. Such techniques are often hindered, however, by the high-dimensionality of many real-world event sequence datasets which can prevent effective aggregation. A common coping strategy for this challenge is to group event types together prior to visualization, as a pre-process, so that each group can be represented within an analysis as a single event type. However, computing these event groupings as a pre-process also places significant constraints on the analysis. This paper presents a new visual analytics approach for dynamic hierarchical dimension aggregation. The approach leverages a predefined hierarchy of dimensions to computationally quantify the informativeness, with respect to a measure of interest, of alternative levels of grouping within the hierarchy at runtime. This information is then interactively visualized, enabling users to dynamically explore the hierarchy to select the most appropriate level of grouping to use at any individual step within an analysis. Key contributions include an algorithm for interactively determining the most informative set of event groupings for a specific analysis context, and a scented scatter-plus-focus visualization design with an optimization-based layout algorithm that supports interactive hierarchical exploration of alternative event type groupings. We apply these techniques to high-dimensional event sequence data from the medical domain and report findings from domain expert interviews.","article_number":"8807220","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8807220","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807220/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807220/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"440","end_page":"450","citing_paper_count":11,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1035,"insert_date":"20190820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visual analytics","Runtime","Sequences","Layout","Navigation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Temporal event sequence visualization","visual analytics","hierarchical aggregation","medical informatics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Sequence Of Events","Visual Analysis","Aggregation Kinetics","Dynamic Assembly","Assembly Kinetics","Hierarchical Aggregation","Event Sequence Data","Group Level","Event Data","Effective Data","Temporal Effects","Temporal Events","Real-world Datasets","Real-world Data Sets","Domain Experts","Measures Of Interest","Visualization Techniques","Interactive Exploration","Visual Design","Optimization-based Algorithm","Scatter Plot","Visual System","Medical Data","Aggregate Level","Hierarchy Of Types","Temporal Sequence Of Events","Events In Group","Cadence","ICD-10 Codes","Hierarchical Relationships","Large Number Of Types","Interview Sessions","Analysis Tasks"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934402","title":"CerebroVis: Designing an Abstract yet Spatially Contextualized Cerebral Artery Network Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":74,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Northeastern University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085662710","id":37085662710,"full_name":"Aditeya Pandey","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University"]}},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087099479","id":37087099479,"full_name":"Harsh Shukla","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Northeastern University"]}},{"affiliation":"Brigham and Women's Hospital","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100494","id":37087100494,"full_name":"Geoffrey S.

If a clinician suspects a patient has a stroke or other cerebrovascular condition, they order imaging tests. Neuroradiologists visually search the resulting scans for abnormalities. Their visual search tasks correspond to the abstract network analysis tasks of browsing and path following. To assist neuroradiologists in identifying cerebral artery abnormalities, we designed CerebroVis, a novel abstract-yet spatially contextualized-cerebral artery network visualization. In this design study, we contribute a novel framing and definition of the cerebral artery system in terms of network theory and characterize neuroradiologist domain goals as abstract visualization and network analysis tasks. Through an iterative, user-centered design process we developed an abstract network layout technique which incorporates cerebral artery spatial context. The abstract visualization enables increased domain task performance over 3D geometry representations, while including spatial context helps preserve the user's mental map of the underlying geometry. We provide open source implementations of our network layout technique and prototype cerebral artery visualization tool. We demonstrate the robustness of our technique by successfully laying out 61 open source brain scans. We evaluate the effectiveness of our layout through a mixed methods study with three neuroradiologists. In a formative controlled experiment our study participants used CerebroVis and a conventional 3D visualization to examine real cerebral artery imaging data to identify a simulated intracranial artery stenosis. Participants were more accurate at identifying stenoses using CerebroVis (absolute risk difference 13%).

ScaleTrotter allows viewers to smoothly transition from the nucleus of a cell to the atomistic composition of the DNA, while bridging several orders of magnitude in scale. The challenges in creating an interactive visualization of genome data are fundamentally different in several ways from those in other domains like astronomy that require a multi-scale representation as well. First, genome data has intertwined scale levels—the DNA is an extremely long, connected molecule that manifests itself at all scale levels. Second, elements of the DNA do not disappear as one zooms out—instead the scale levels at which they are observed group these elements differently. Third, we have detailed information and thus geometry for the entire dataset and for all scale levels, posing a challenge for interactive visual exploration. Finally, the conceptual scale levels for genome data are close in scale space, requiring us to find ways to visually embed a smaller scale into a coarser one. We address these challenges by creating a new multi-scale visualization concept. We use a scale-dependent camera model that controls the visual embedding of the scales into their respective parents, the rendering of a subset of the scale hierarchy, and the location, size, and scope of the view. In traversing the scales, ScaleTrotter is roaming between 2D and 3D visual representations that are depicted in integrated visuals. We discuss, specifically, how this form of multi-scale visualization follows from the specific characteristics of the genome data and describe its implementation. Finally, we discuss the implications of our work to the general illustrative depiction of multi-scale data.","article_number":"8805465","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8805465","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805465/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805465/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"654","end_page":"664","citing_paper_count":11,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":849,"insert_date":"20190819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Data visualization","Genomics","Bioinformatics","DNA","Biological cells","Three-dimensional displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Multi-scale visualization","scale transition","abstraction","human genome","DNA","Hi-C data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Smoothing","Genomic Data","Characteristics Of Data","Features Of Data","Visual Representation","Smooth Transition","Scale Level","Conceptual Level","Interactive Visualization","Scale Space","Scale-space","Interactive Exploration","2D Representation","Magnitude Scale","Multi-scale Representation","Multi-scale Data","Focal Point","Domain Experts","Differences In Scale","Physical Size","Interactive Tool","Sequence Of Points","Semantic Scale","Scene Graph","3D Genome","Multiscale Techniques","Detailed Scale","Seamless Transition","Semantic Level","Abstract Representations","Color Assignment","Colour Assignment","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934784","title":"A Comparison of Radial and Linear Charts for Visualizing Daily Patterns","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":76,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"TU Wien","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37844773200","id":37844773200,"full_name":"Manuela Waldner","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Wien"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Zurich","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085736053","id":37085736053,"full_name":"Alexandra Diehl","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Zurich"]}},{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37323697500","id":37323697500,"full_name":"Denis Gračanin","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virginia Tech"]}},{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085338700","id":37085338700,"full_name":"Rainer Splechtna","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VRVis Research Center"]}},{"affiliation":"Electric and Computer Eng.

Perhaps the only exception is in visualizing periodical time-dependent data, which is believed to be naturally supported by the radial layout. It has been demonstrated that the drawbacks of radial charts outweigh the benefits of this natural mapping. Visualization of daily patterns, as a special case, has not been systematically evaluated using radial charts. In contrast to yearly or weekly recurrent trends, the analysis of daily patterns on a radial chart may benefit from our trained skill on reading radial clocks that are ubiquitous in our culture. In a crowd-sourced experiment with 92 non-expert users, we evaluated the accuracy, efficiency, and subjective ratings of radial and linear charts for visualizing daily traffic accident patterns. We systematically compared juxtaposed 12-hours variants and single 24-hours variants for both layouts in four low-level tasks and one high-level interpretation task. Our results show that over all tasks, the most elementary 24-hours linear bar chart is most accurate and efficient and is also preferred by the users. This provides strong evidence for the use of linear layouts - even for visualizing periodical daily patterns.","article_number":"8807238","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8807238","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807238/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807238/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"1033","end_page":"1042","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1140,"insert_date":"20190820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Bars","Data visualization","Layout","Clocks","Task analysis","Time series analysis","Encoding"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Radial charts","time series series data","daily patterns","crowd-sourced experiment"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Daily Patterns","Traffic Accidents","Motor Vehicle Accidents","Car Accident","Subjective Ratings","Bar Charts","Time-dependent Data","Time Dependent Data","Time Series","Time-series","Cardinality","Set Size","Time Series Data","Time-series Data","Generalized Linear Mixed Models","GLMM","Number Of Responses","Completion Time","Interval Values","Pie Chart","Linear Line","Independent Coders","Description Task","Untargeted Analysis","User Feedback","Line Chart","One-hour Intervals","Visual Encoding","Disc Segmentation","Circular Segment","Circle Segments","Grid Lines","Target Interval","Target Time Interval","Relative Judgments","Decoding","Decryption","Time Interval","Rush Hour","Number Of Observations"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934555","title":"Pattern-Driven Navigation in 2D Multiscale Visualizations with Scalable Insets","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":77,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086215204","id":37086215204,"full_name":"Fritz Lekschas","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38551542600","id":38551542600,"full_name":"Michael Behrisch","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085687578","id":37085687578,"full_name":"Benjamin Bach","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086224967","id":37086224967,"full_name":"Peter Kerpedjiev","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37972937500","id":37972937500,"full_name":"Nils Gehlenborg","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275698100","id":37275698100,"full_name":"Hanspeter Pfister","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present Scalable Insets, a technique for interactively exploring and navigating large numbers of annotated patterns in multiscale visualizations such as gigapixel images, matrices, or maps. Exploration of many but sparsely-distributed patterns in multiscale visualizations is challenging as visual representations change across zoom levels, context and navigational cues get lost upon zooming, and navigation is time consuming. Our technique visualizes annotated patterns too small to be identifiable at certain zoom levels using insets, i.e., magnified thumbnail views of the annotated patterns. Insets support users in searching, comparing, and contextualizing patterns while reducing the amount of navigation needed. They are dynamically placed either within the viewport or along the boundary of the viewport to offer a compromise between locality and context preservation. Annotated patterns are interactively clustered by location and type. They are visually represented as an aggregated inset to provide scalable exploration within a single viewport. In a controlled user study with 18 participants, we found that Scalable Insets can speed up visual search and improve the accuracy of pattern comparison at the cost of slower frequency estimation compared to a baseline technique. A second study with 6 experts in the field of genomics showed that Scalable Insets is easy to learn and provides first insights into how Scalable Insets can be applied in an open-ended data exploration scenario.","article_number":"8809750","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8809750","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8809750/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8809750/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"611","end_page":"621","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":715,"insert_date":"20190822","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Navigation","Genomics","Bioinformatics","Data visualization","Labeling","Lenses"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Guided Navigation","Pattern Exploration","Multiscale Visualizations","Gigapixel Images","Geospatial Maps","Genomics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["User Study","Comparison Of Patterns","Comparable Patterns","Number Of Patterns","Frequency Estimation","Visual Search","Visual Scanning","Zoom Level","Large Datasets","Large Data Sets","Typical Pattern","Structural Patterns","Completion Time","Bounding Box","Cartographic","Dynamic Mechanism","Kinetic Mechanism","Simulated Annealing","Domain Experts","Individual Sessions","Computational Biology","Interactive Visualization","Detailed Patterns","Frames Per Second","Detailed Visualization","Patterns In Space","Holding Space","Mouse Cursor","OpenStreetMap","Open Street Map","Usage Scenarios","User-defined Threshold"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934282","title":"Designing for Mobile and Immersive Visual Analytics in the Field","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":78,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Colorado","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086432016","id":37086432016,"full_name":"Matt Whitlock","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Colorado"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Colorado","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101096","id":37087101096,"full_name":"Keke Wu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Colorado"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Colorado","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085770068","id":37085770068,"full_name":"Danielle Albers Szafir","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Colorado"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Data collection and analysis in the field is critical for operations in domains such as environmental science and public safety.

Nowadays, the coordination between the muscles to generate simple movements is still not well understood, hindering the knowledge of how to best treat patients with this type of peripheral nerve injury. To acquire enough information for medical data analysis, physicians conduct motion analysis assessments with patients to produce a rich dataset of electromyographic signals from multiple muscles recorded with joint movements during real-world tasks. However, tools for the analysis and visualization of the data in a succinct and interpretable manner are currently not available. Without the ability to integrate, compare, and compute multiple data sources in one platform, physicians can only compute simple statistical values to describe patient's behavior vaguely, which limits the possibility to answer clinical questions and generate hypotheses for research. To address this challenge, we have developed MOTION BROWSER, an interactive visual analytics system which provides an efficient framework to extract and compare muscle activity patterns from the patient's limbs and coordinated views to help users analyze muscle signals, motion data, and video information to address different tasks. The system was developed as a result of a collaborative endeavor between computer scientists and orthopedic surgery and rehabilitation physicians. We present case studies showing physicians can utilize the information displayed to understand how individuals coordinate their muscles to initiate appropriate treatment and generate new hypotheses for future research.","article_number":"8809920","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8809920","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8809920/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8809920/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"981","end_page":"990","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":539,"insert_date":"20190822","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Muscles","Data visualization","Brachytherapy","Time series analysis","Task analysis","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Medical Data Visualization","Visual Analytics Application","Time Series Data","Multimodal Data","Brachial Plexus Injuries"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Upper Limb","Upper Extremity","Upper-limb","Brachial Plexus","Brachial Nerve","Brachial Plexus Injury","Brachial Plexopathy","Data Visualization","Muscle Activity","Visual Analysis","Interactive System","Motion Analysis","Interactive Visualization","Electromyography Signals","Motion Data","Rehabilitation Physician","Hypotheses For Future Research","Time Series","Time-series","Analysis Of Patients","Forearm","Range Of Motion","Significant Signals","Bar Charts","Trapezius","Trapezius Muscle","Temporal Data","Shoulder Motion","Strong Muscle","Muscle Coordination","Raw Electromyography Signals","Line Chart","Muscle Bundles","Multivariate Signal","Shoulder Abduction"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934667","title":"Galex: Exploring the Evolution and Intersection of Disciplines","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":80,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089090068","id":37089090068,"full_name":"Zeyu Li","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101961","id":37087101961,"full_name":"Changhong Zhang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102818","id":37087102818,"full_name":"Shichao Jia","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37281468400","id":37281468400,"full_name":"Jiawan Zhang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University","Tianjin cultural heritage conservation and inheritance engineering technology center, Key Research Center for Surface Monitoring and Analysis of Relics, State Administration of Cultural Heritage, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Revealing the evolution of science and the intersections among its sub-fields is extremely important to understand the characteristics of disciplines, discover new topics, and predict the future. The current work focuses on either building the skeleton of science, lacking interaction, detailed exploration and interpretation or on the lower topic level, missing high-level macro-perspective. To fill this gap, we design and implement Galaxy Evolution Explorer (Galex), a hierarchical visual analysis system, in combination with advanced text mining technologies, that could help analysts to comprehend the evolution and intersection of one discipline rapidly. We divide Galex into three progressively fine-grained levels: discipline, area, and institution levels. The combination of interactions enables analysts to explore an arbitrary piece of history and an arbitrary part of the knowledge space of one discipline. Using a flexible spotlight component, analysts could freely select and quickly understand an exploration region. A tree metaphor allows analysts to perceive the expansion, decline, and intersection of topics intuitively. A synchronous spotlight interaction aids in comparing research contents among institutions easily. Three cases demonstrate the effectiveness of our system.","article_number":"8807243","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8807243","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807243/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807243/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"1182","end_page":"1192","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":909,"insert_date":"20190820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Computer science","Semantics","Brushes","Skeleton","Data mining"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Science evolution","science mapping","interdisciplinary","knowledge domain visualization","visual analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Intersection Of Disciplines","Intersection Of These Disciplines","Visual Analysis","Institutional Level","Research Content","Synchronous Interactions","Deep Learning","Topical","Isothermal","Contour Plots","Data Mining","Data-mining","Computer Science","Text Data","Text Corpus","Semantic Segmentation","3D Visualization","Topic Distribution","Distribution Of Subjects","Collection Of Papers","Document Collection","Co-occurrence Network","Time Slice","Computational Geometry","Geometric Calculations","Usage Scenarios","Key Phrases","Area Of Artificial Intelligence","Key Entities","Science Mapping","Rich Interactions","Core Zone","Interactive","Context-aware","Computer Graphics","Human-computer Interaction","Human Computer Interaction","User Interaction","Fundamental Matrix","Fundamental Matrices"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934546","title":"Cohort-based T-SSIM Visual Computing for Radiation Therapy Prediction and Exploration","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":81,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Illinois at Chicago","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100729","id":37087100729,"full_name":"A.

Visual analytics tools increasingly play a key role in exploring and answering complex questions about these large datasets. However, many visualizations are not designed to concurrently visualize the large number of dimensions present in complex datasets (e.g. tens of thousands of distinct codes in an electronic health record system). This fact, combined with the ability of many visual analytics systems to enable rapid, ad-hoc specification of groups, or cohorts, of individuals based on a small subset of visualized dimensions, leads to the possibility of introducing selection bias-when the user creates a cohort based on a specified set of dimensions, differences across many other unseen dimensions may also be introduced. These unintended side effects may result in the cohort no longer being representative of the larger population intended to be studied, which can negatively affect the validity of subsequent analyses. We present techniques for selection bias tracking and visualization that can be incorporated into high-dimensional exploratory visual analytics systems, with a focus on medical data with existing data hierarchies. These techniques include: (1) tree-based cohort provenance and visualization, including a user-specified baseline cohort that all other cohorts are compared against, and visual encoding of cohort “drift”, which indicates where selection bias may have occurred, and (2) a set of visualizations, including a novel icicle-plot based visualization, to compare in detail the per-dimension differences between the baseline and a user-specified focus cohort. These techniques are integrated into a medical temporal event sequence visual analytics tool.

However, the data uncertainty imposes profound challenges to fulfill advanced analytics requirements. On the one hand, many underlying data does not contain accurate geographic coordinates, e.g., positions of a mobile phone only refer to the regions (i.e., mobile cell stations) in which it resides, instead of accurate GPS coordinates. On the other hand, domain experts and general users prefer a natural way, such as using a natural language sentence, to access and analyze massive movement data. In this paper, we propose a visual analytics approach that can extract spatial-temporal constraints from a textual sentence and support an effective query method over uncertain mobile trajectory data. It is built up on encoding massive, spatially uncertain trajectories by the semantic information of the POIs and regions covered by them, and then storing the trajectory documents in text database with an effective indexing scheme. The visual interface facilitates query condition specification, situation-aware visualization, and semantic exploration of large trajectory data. Usage scenarios on real-world human mobility datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","article_number":"8807274","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8807274","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807274/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807274/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"1256","end_page":"1266","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1008,"insert_date":"20190820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Trajectory","Semantics","Visualization","Natural languages","Indexing","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Engines"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Natural-language-based Visual Query","Spatial Uncertaity","Trajectory Exploration"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Human Trajectory","Uncertain Trajectory","Visual Query","Mobile Phone","Natural Language","Semantic Information","Domain Experts","Trajectory Data","Visual Exploration","Visual Interface","Uncertain Data","Indexing Scheme","Indexing Strategy","Natural Sentences","Topical","Base Station","Mobile Data","Mobile Broadband","Tourist Attractions","Word Embedding","Word Vectors","Data Partitioning","Spatial Regions","Spatial Uncertainty","Temporal Constraints","Map View","Descriptive Words","Query Results","Relevance Score","Input Sentence","Spatial Query","Central Park","Term Frequency-inverse Document Frequency","Inverse Document Frequency","TF-IDF"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934257","title":"Toward Localized Topological Data Structures: Querying the Forest for the Tree","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":86,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085718422","id":37085718422,"full_name":"Pavol Klacansky","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37870001700","id":37870001700,"full_name":"Attila Gyulassy","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564112000","id":37564112000,"full_name":"Peer-Timo Bremer","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284312600","id":37284312600,"full_name":"Valerio Pascucci","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Topological approaches to data analysis can answer complex questions about the number, connectivity, and scale of intrinsic features in scalar data. However, the global nature of many topological structures makes their computation challenging at scale, and thus often limits the size of data that can be processed. One key quality to achieving scalability and performance on modern architectures is data locality, i.e., a process operates on data that resides in a nearby memory system, avoiding frequent jumps in data access patterns. From this perspective, topological computations are particularly challenging because the implied data structures represent features that can span the entire data set, often requiring a global traversal phase that limits their scalability. Traditionally, expensive preprocessing is considered an acceptable trade-off as it accelerates all subsequent queries. Most published use cases, however, explore only a fraction of all possible queries, most often those returning small, local features. In these cases, much of the global information is not utilized, yet computing it dominates the overall response time. We address this challenge for merge trees, one of the most commonly used topological structures. In particular, we propose an alternative representation, the merge forest, a collection of local trees corresponding to regions in a domain decomposition. Local trees are connected by a bridge set that allows us to recover any necessary global information at query time. The resulting system couples (i) a preprocessing that scales linearly in practice with (ii) fast runtime queries that provide the same functionality as traditional queries of a global merge tree. We test the scalability of our approach on a shared-memory parallel computer and demonstrate how data structure locality enables the analysis of large data with an order of magnitude performance improvement over the status quo. Furthermore, a merge forest reduces the memory overhead compared to a global merge tree and enables the processing of data sets that are an order of magnitude larger than possible with previous algorithms.","article_number":"8794560","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8794560","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8794560/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8794560/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"173","end_page":"183","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":649,"insert_date":"20190812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Vegetation","Forestry","Feature extraction","Data structures","Scalability","Acceleration","Task analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Merge tree","parallel computation","topology"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Structure","Topological Structure","Topological Structure Of Data","Parallelization","Parallel Computing","Global Information","Modern Architecture","Modern Design","Query Time","Domain Decomposition","Merging Algorithm","Merge Tree","Critical Point","Local Structure","Linear Scale","Scale Bar","Size Of Region","Regular Grid","Cartesian Grid","Grid Structure","Rectangular Grid","Extensive Evaluation","Topological Analysis","Isosurface","Forest Structure","Hybrid Algorithm","Simplicial Complex","Parallel Algorithm","Sublevel Set","Superlevel Sets","Parallel Efficiency","Local Structure Of Data","Complex Topology","Load Imbalance","Subset Of Edges","Feature Tracking","Feature-tracking"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934783","title":"ShapeWordle: Tailoring Wordles using Shape-aware Archimedean Spirals","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":87,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Shandong University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085804605","id":37085804605,"full_name":"Yunhai Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shandong University"]}},{"affiliation":"Shandong University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086242208","id":37086242208,"full_name":"Xiaowei Chu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shandong University"]}},{"affiliation":"Shandong University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088730510","id":37088730510,"full_name":"Kaiyi Zhang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shandong University"]}},{"affiliation":"Shandong University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086245856","id":37086245856,"full_name":"Chen Bao","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shandong University"]}},{"affiliation":"Shandong University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086428953","id":37086428953,"full_name":"Xiaotong Li","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shandong University"]}},{"affiliation":"CNIC, CAS","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38026660700","id":38026660700,"full_name":"Jian Zhang","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["CNIC, CAS"]}},{"affiliation":"Chinese University of Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37336329800","id":37336329800,"full_name":"Chi-Wing Fu","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Chinese University of Hong Kong"]}},{"affiliation":"ENAC, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017336200","id":38017336200,"full_name":"Christophe Hurter","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["ENAC, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Konstanz University, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266781000","id":37266781000,"full_name":"Oliver Deussen","author_order":9,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Konstanz University, Germany","Shenzhen VisuCA Key Lab, SIAT, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37293389400","id":37293389400,"full_name":"Bongshin Lee","author_order":10,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present a new technique to enable the creation of shape-bounded Wordles, we call ShapeWordle, in which we fit words to form a given shape.

As a result, this hinders the user ability to create efficient aggregated visualizations. To address these issues, we investigated a novel way of handling visual aggregation with a task-driven and user-centered approach. Given a graph, our approach produces a decluttered view as follows: first, the user investigates different edge bundling results and specifies areas, where certain edge bundling techniques would provide user-desired results. Second, our system then computes a smooth and structural preserving transition between these specified areas. Lastly, the user can further fine-tune the global visualization with a direct manipulation technique to remove the local ambiguity and to apply different visual deformations. In this paper, we provide details for our design rationale and implementation. Also, we show how our algorithm gives more suitable results compared to current edge bundling techniques, and in the end, we provide concrete instances of usages, where the algorithm combines various edge bundling results to support diverse data exploration and visualizations.","article_number":"8807234","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8807234","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807234/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807234/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"687","end_page":"696","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":814,"insert_date":"20190820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Layout","Data visualization","Visualization","Task analysis","Strain","Smoothing methods","Optimization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["path visualization","trajectory visualization","edge bundles"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive","Ambiguity","Rational Design","Design Principles","Data Visualization","Exploratory Data","User-centered Approach","Final Results","Local Structure","Control Points","Term In Eq","Smooth Transition","Convex Hull","Local Deformation","Single View","Straightforward Solution","Fisheye Lens","Wide-angle Lens","Fisheye Camera","Fisheye Lenses","Second Term In Eq","Edge Points","First Term In Eq","Edge Connectivity","Edge-connectivity","Edge Segmentation","Graph Layout","Graph Drawing","Smoothness Constraint","Smooth Constraints","Bezier Curve","Cubic Bézier","Bézier Curves","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Edge Width","Edge Widths","Sankey Diagram","Sankey Plot","Pixel-based Methods","Pixel-based Method","Aggregate Results","Aggregate Outcomes"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934432","title":"Discriminability Tests for Visualization Effectiveness and Scalability","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":89,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Ontario Tech University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37893068700","id":37893068700,"full_name":"Rafael Veras","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Ontario Tech University"]}},{"affiliation":"Ontario Tech University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37669874100","id":37669874100,"full_name":"Christopher Collins","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Ontario Tech University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The scalability of a particular visualization approach is limited by the ability for people to discern differences between plots made with different datasets. Ideally, when the data changes, the visualization changes in perceptible ways. This relation breaks down when there is a mismatch between the encoding and the character of the dataset being viewed. Unfortunately, visualizations are often designed and evaluated without fully exploring how they will respond to a wide variety of datasets. We explore the use of an image similarity measure, the Multi-Scale Structural Similarity Index (MS-SSIM), for testing the discriminability of a data visualization across a variety of datasets. MS-SSIM is able to capture the similarity of two visualizations across multiple scales, including low level granular changes and high level patterns. Significant data changes that are not captured by the MS-SSIM indicate visualizations of low discriminability and effectiveness. The measure's utility is demonstrated with two empirical studies. In the first, we compare human similarity judgments and MS-SSIM scores for a collection of scatterplots. In the second, we compute the discriminability values for a set of basic visualizations and compare them with empirical measurements of effectiveness. In both cases, the analyses show that the computational measure is able to approximate empirical results. Our approach can be used to rank competing encodings on their discriminability and to aid in selecting visualizations for a particular type of data distribution.","article_number":"8809850","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8809850","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8809850/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8809850/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"749","end_page":"758","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":564,"insert_date":"20190822","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Encoding","Scalability","Image coding","Task analysis","Indexes"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Scalability","Discriminability","Simulation","Perception"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Scalable","Use Of Measures","Similarity Measure","Similarity Metrics","Visible Changes","Similarity Judgments","Empirical Data","Image Quality","Gradient Descent","Steepest Descent","Perception Of Quality","Visual Methods","Visual Method","Structural Conservation","Preservation Of Structure","Color Space","Colour Space","Color Components","Outlier Detection","Collection Of Datasets","Collection Of Data Sets","Perceptual Similarity","Human Visual System","Vision Science","Visual Design","Discrimination Scores","Adjusted Rand Index","Visual Encoding","Just Noticeable Difference","Just-noticeable-difference","Bubble Chart","Regularization Loss","Chart Types","Spatial Encoding","General Linear Model","Image Compression","Quality Measures","Changes In Perception"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934660","title":"sPortfolio: Stratified Visual Analysis of Stock Portfolios","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":90,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Sinovation Ventures AI Institute","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086543179","id":37086543179,"full_name":"Xuanwu Yue","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Sinovation Ventures AI Institute"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087099961","id":37087099961,"full_name":"Jiaxin Bai","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087099900","id":37087099900,"full_name":"Qinhan Liu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101816","id":37087101816,"full_name":"Yiyang Tang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085659211","id":37085659211,"full_name":"Abishek Puri","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"RiceQuant Co.

However, the multi-factor model generates enormous quantities of factor data, through which even experienced portfolio managers find it difficult to navigate. This has led to portfolio analysis and factor research being limited by a lack of intuitive visual analytics tools. Previous portfolio visualization systems have mainly focused on the relationship between the portfolio return and stock holdings, which is insufficient for making actionable insights or understanding market trends.

In particular, sPortfolio provides a holistic overview of the factor data and aims to facilitate the analysis at three different levels: a Risk-Factor level, for a general market situation analysis; a Multiple-Portfolio level, for understanding the portfolio strategies; and a Single-Portfolio level, for investigating detailed operations. The system's effectiveness and usability are demonstrated through three case studies.

We propose a novel architecture for spatiotemporal data management. The architecture can dynamically update itself based on user queries. Datasets is stored in a tree-like structure to support memory sharing among cuboids in a logical structure of data cubes. An update mechanism is designed to create or remove cuboids on it, according to the analysis of the user queries, with the consideration of memory size limitation. Data structure is dynamically optimized according to different user queries. During a query process, user queries are recorded to predict the performance increment of the new cuboid. The creation or deletion of a cuboid is determined by performance increment. Experiment results show that our prototype system deliveries good performance towards user queries on different spatiotemporal datasets, which costing small memory size with comparable performance compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms.","article_number":"8809847","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8809847","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8809847/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8809847/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"790","end_page":"799","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1323,"insert_date":"20190822","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Data structures","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Memory management","Task analysis","Real-time systems","Data aggregation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["data management","spatial-temporal data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Management","Real-time Visualization","Visualization Of Datasets","Visualization Of Data Sets","Spatiotemporal Datasets","Spatiotemporal Data Sets","Data Structure","Spatiotemporal Data","Memory Size","Data Cube","Datacube","Tree-like Structure","Time Series","Time-series","Visual System","Temporal Dimension","Time Dimension","Temporal Properties","Spatial Dimensions","Spatial Attributes","Tree Structure","Tree-structured","Low Latency","Value Of Node","Memory Usage","Convergence Time","Spatial Regions","Performance In Scenarios","Combination Of Dimensions","Dimensions Of Categories","Categories For Each Dimension","Update Algorithm","Levels Of Dimensions","Memory Cost","Partial Order","Spatial Query","Dense Time Series","Dense Time-series","Reduce Memory Usage","Aggregate Value"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934669","title":"Exploranative Code Quality Documents","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":92,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"VISUS, University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086223940","id":37086223940,"full_name":"Haris Mumtaz","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VISUS, University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Paluno, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085662755","id":37085662755,"full_name":"Shahid Latif","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Paluno, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Paluno, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586060300","id":37586060300,"full_name":"Fabian Beck","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Paluno, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"VISUS, University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268045000","id":37268045000,"full_name":"Daniel Weiskopf","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VISUS, University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Good code quality is a prerequisite for efficiently developing maintainable software.

Malfunctioning valves can be treated by reconstructive surgeries, which have to be carefully planned and evaluated. While current research focuses on the modeling and segmentation of the valve, we base our work on existing segmentations of patient-specific mitral valves, that are also time-resolved (3D+t) over the cardiac cycle. The interpretation of the data can be ambiguous, due to the complex surface of the valve and multiple time steps. We therefore propose a software prototype to analyze such 3D+t data, by extracting pathophysiological parameters and presenting them via dimensionally reduced visualizations. For this, we rely on an existing algorithm to unroll the convoluted valve surface towards a flattened 2D representation. In this paper, we show that the 3D+t data can be transferred to 3D or 2D representations in a way that allows the domain expert to faithfully grasp important aspects of the cardiac cycle. In this course, we not only consider common pathophysiological parameters, but also introduce new observations that are derived from landmarks within the segmentation model. Our analysis techniques were developed in collaboration with domain experts and a survey showed that the insights have the potential to support mitral valve diagnosis and the comparison of the preand post-operative condition of a patient.","article_number":"8805441","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8805441","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805441/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805441/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"971","end_page":"980","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":400,"insert_date":"20190819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Valves","Three-dimensional displays","Data visualization","Surgery","Two dimensional displays","Geometry","Solid modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Mitral valve","quantification","medical visualization","parameterization","spatio-temporal visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Mitral Valve","Bicuspid Valve","Valve Geometry","Time Step","Left Ventricular","Left Ventricle","Left Ventricular Function","Plastic Surgery","Reconstructive Surgery","Domain Experts","Cardiac Cycle","Human Heart","Left Atrium","2D Representation","Parameter Space","Temporal Dimension","Time Dimension","Temporal Properties","3D Space","3-dimensional Space","Color Code","Colour Code","Color-coding","Color Map","Colour Map","Colormap","Prolapse","3D Mesh","Surface Mesh","Mitral Regurgitation","Mitral Insufficiency","Mitral Valve Regurgitation","Mitral Valve Disease","Spatiotemporal Data","Respective Time Points","Respective Timepoints","Posterior Leaflet","Normal Valve","Pathological Indicators","Pathological Index","Single Time Step","Single Timestep","Domain Parameters","Systolic Peak","Chordae Tendineae","Heartstrings","Chordae Tendinae","Mitral Valve Surgery","2D Views","Mitral Annulus"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934620","title":"High-throughput feature extraction for measuring attributes of deforming open-cell foams","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":95,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086120775","id":37086120775,"full_name":"Steve Petruzza","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SCI Institute, University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37870001700","id":37870001700,"full_name":"Attila Gyulassy","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SCI Institute, University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087103307","id":37087103307,"full_name":"Samuel Leventhal","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SCI Institute, University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"Dep.

Currently, X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) scans of these materials are segmented either manually or with skeletonization approaches that may not accurately model the variety of shapes present in nodes and ligaments, especially irregularities that arise from manufacturing, image artifacts, or deterioration due to compression. In this paper, we present a new workflow for analysis of open-cell foams that combines a new density measurement to identify nodal structures, and topological approaches to identify ligament structures between them. Additionally, we provide automated measurement of foam properties. We demonstrate stable extraction of features and time-tracking in an image sequence of a foam being compressed. Our approach allows researchers to study larger and more complex foams than could previously be segmented only manually, and enables the high-throughput analysis needed to predict future foam performance.","article_number":"8807223","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8807223","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807223/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807223/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"140","end_page":"150","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":612,"insert_date":"20190820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Ligaments","Junctions","Computed tomography","Image coding","Feature extraction","Image segmentation","Lattices"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Topological analysis","foam","features extraction","feature tracking"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Open-cell Foams","Open Cell Foams","High-throughput Feature Extraction","High Throughput Feature Extraction","X-ray Computed Tomography","Skeletonization","Biomedical Implants","Metal Foam","Aluminum Foam","Metallic Foams","Performance Of Foams","Time Series","Time-series","Time Step","Image Intensity","Noise In Data","Threshold Selection","Feature Matching","Matching Characteristics","Distance Map","Distance Transform","Distance Field","Density Field","Image Time Series","Time-series Images","Feature Tracking","Feature-tracking","Material Point","Geodesic Distance","Greedy Approach","Overview Of Workflow","Sublevel Set","Superlevel Sets","Number Of Junctions","Signed Distance Function","Signed Distance Field","Material Interface","Prior Step","Cross-sectional Slices","Yellow Box","Changes In Connectivity","Normal Vector"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934314","title":"Multi-Scale Topological Analysis of Asymmetric Tensor Fields on Surfaces","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":96,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Oregon State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102540","id":37087102540,"full_name":"Fariba Khan","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oregon State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Oregon State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086255270","id":37086255270,"full_name":"Lawrence Roy","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oregon State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Oregon State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37398562200","id":37398562200,"full_name":"Eugene Zhang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oregon State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Oregon State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100795","id":37087100795,"full_name":"Botong Qu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oregon State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Oregon State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087099837","id":37087099837,"full_name":"Shih-Hsuan Hung","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oregon State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Oregon State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37889942300","id":37889942300,"full_name":"Harry Yeh","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oregon State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Swansea University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267247900","id":37267247900,"full_name":"Robert S.

For instance, potential vorticity plays a key role in particularly strong wind peaks in extratropical cyclones and it is able to explain the occurrence of frontal rain bands. Potential vorticity combines the key quantities of atmospheric dynamics, namely rotation and stratification. Under suitable wind conditions elongated banners of potential vorticity appear in the lee of mountains. Their role in atmospheric dynamics has recently raised considerable interest in the meteorological community for instance due to their influence in aviation wind hazards and maritime transport. In order to support meteorologists and climatologists in the analysis of these structures, we developed an extraction algorithm and a visual exploration framework consisting of multiple linked views. For the extraction we apply a predictor-corrector algorithm that follows streamlines and realigns them with extremal lines of potential vorticity. Using the agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm, we group banners from different sources based on their proximity. To visually analyze the time-dependent banner geometry, we provide interactive overviews and enable the query for detail on demand, including the analysis of different time steps, potentially correlated scalar quantities, and the wind vector field. In particular, we study the relationship between relative humidity and the banners for their potential in indicating the development of precipitation. Working with our method, the collaborating meteorologists gained a deeper understanding of the three-dimensional processes, which may spur follow-up research in the future.","article_number":"8805433","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8805433","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805433/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805433/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"259","end_page":"269","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":517,"insert_date":"20190819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Feature extraction","Visualization","Prediction algorithms","Three-dimensional displays","Meteorology","Two dimensional displays","Cyclones"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Scientific Visualization","potential vorticity","meteorology","feature extraction"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Potential Vorticity","Relative Humidity","Time Step","Cyclone","Vector Field","Agglomerative Clustering","Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering","Atmospheric Dynamics","Three-dimensional Process","Visual System","Local Minima","Vertical Direction","Numerical Data","Numerous Data","Local Method","Local Methods","Mountain Ranges","Spatial Clustering","Visualization Techniques","Interactive Visualization","High-resolution Model","Steepest Descent Method","Saddle Point Approximation","Steepest Descent Methods","Saddlepoint Approximation","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Air Parcel","Changes In Altitude","Mountain Peaks","Numerical Weather Prediction","Weather Models","Temporal Clustering","Parallel Coordinates","Geometric Representation","Jet Stream","Subtropical Jet","Potential Temperature"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934536","title":"Estimating Color-Concept Associations from Image Statistics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":98,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Sciences and Wisconsin Institute for Discovery (WID), University of Wisconsin–Madison","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100122","id":37087100122,"full_name":"Ragini Rathore","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Sciences and Wisconsin Institute for Discovery (WID), University of Wisconsin–Madison"]}},{"affiliation":"Biology and WID, University of Wisconisn–Madison","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100891","id":37087100891,"full_name":"Zachary Leggon","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Biology and WID, University of Wisconisn–Madison"]}},{"affiliation":"Electrical and Computer Engineering and WID, University of Wisconsin–Madison","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37409769000","id":37409769000,"full_name":"Laurent Lessard","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering and WID, University of Wisconsin–Madison"]}},{"affiliation":"Psychology and WID, University of Wisconsin–Madison","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085509824","id":37085509824,"full_name":"Karen B.

This process is easier when assignments between colors and concepts in visualizations match people's expectations, making color palettes semantically interpretable. Efforts have been underway to optimize color palette design for semantic interpretablity, but this requires having good estimates of human color-concept associations. Obtaining these data from humans is costly, which motivates the need for automated methods. We developed and evaluated a new method for automatically estimating color-concept associations in a way that strongly correlates with human ratings. Building on prior studies using Google Images, our approach operates directly on Google Image search results without the need for humans in the loop. Specifically, we evaluated several methods for extracting raw pixel content of the images in order to best estimate color-concept associations obtained from human ratings. The most effective method extracted colors using a combination of cylindrical sectors and color categories in color space. We demonstrate that our approach can accurately estimate average human color-concept associations for different fruits using only a small set of images. The approach also generalizes moderately well to more complicated recycling-related concepts of objects that can appear in any color.","article_number":"8809846","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8809846","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8809846/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8809846/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"1226","end_page":"1235","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":650,"insert_date":"20190822","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image color analysis","Data visualization","Databases","Google","Semantics","Cognition","Visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual Reasoning","Visual Communication","Visual Encoding","Color Perception","Color Cognition","Color Categories"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Image Statistics","Scene Statistics","Color Space","Colour Space","Color Components","Association Estimates","Human Need","Expectancy Of People","Color Palette","Colour Palette","Color Categories","Color Classification","Colour Categories","Human-in-the-loop","Human In The Loop","Image Pixels","Types Of Images","Color Images","Colour Images","Visual Input","Blueberry","Photographic Images","Photo Images","Image Exposure","Color Word","Color-naming","Color Naming","Color-word","Set Of Concepts","Hue Angle","Center Of Frame","Sparse Regression","Experiment 1b","Experiment 1a","Ball Model","Spatial Window","Target Color","Target Colour","Extract Color","Cartoon Images","Concept Words","Affinity Score","Top Image"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934594","title":"Scalable Topological Data Analysis and Visualization for Evaluating Data-Driven Models in Scientific Applications","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":99,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38025553600","id":38025553600,"full_name":"Shusen Liu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088742368","id":37088742368,"full_name":"Di Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SCI Institute, University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085822393","id":37085822393,"full_name":"Dan Maljovec","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SCI Institute, University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077387500","id":37077387500,"full_name":"Rushil Anirudh","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37392160300","id":37392160300,"full_name":"Jayaraman J.

First, the utilization of black box models (e.g., deep neural networks) calls for advanced techniques in exploring and interpreting model behaviors. Second, the rapid growth in computing has produced enormous datasets that require techniques that can handle millions or more samples. Although some solutions to these interpretability challenges have been proposed, they typically do not scale beyond thousands of samples, nor do they provide the high-level intuition scientists are looking for. Here, we present the first scalable solution to explore and analyze high-dimensional functions often encountered in the scientific data analysis pipeline. By combining a new streaming neighborhood graph construction, the corresponding topology computation, and a novel data aggregation scheme, namely topology aware datacubes, we enable interactive exploration of both the topological and the geometric aspect of high-dimensional data. Following two use cases from high-energy-density (HED) physics and computational biology, we demonstrate how these capabilities have led to crucial new insights in both applications.","article_number":"8820172","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8820172","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8820172/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8820172/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"291","end_page":"300","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":996,"insert_date":"20190830","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Computational modeling","Data visualization","Data analysis","Analytical models","Topology","Physics","Predictive models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Model Evaluation","Deep Learning","High-Dimensional Space","Topological Data Analysis","Inertial Confinement Fusion"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Scalable","Data Visualization","Scientific Applications","Topological Analysis","Data-driven Models","Topological Data Analysis","Neural Network","Machine Learning","Machine-learning","Deep Neural Network","Computational Biology","Interactive Exploration","Data Cube","Datacube","High-dimensional Functions","High-dimensional Mapping","Molecular Dynamics Simulations","Parameter Space","High Error","Visualization Tool","Topological Structure","Topological Features","Topological Characteristics","Inertial Confinement Fusion","Inertial Fusion","Inertial Fusion Energy","Parallel Coordinates","Forward Error","Spacing Error","Latent Space","Embedding Space","Topological Information","Region Of Parameter Space","Interactive Visualization","Local Extrema"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934556","title":"The Role of Latency and Task Complexity in Predicting Visual Search Behavior","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":100,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086366223","id":37086366223,"full_name":"Leilani Battle","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Smith College","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38229914800","id":38229914800,"full_name":"R.

While this effect is frequently observed and widely accepted, precisely how latency affects different analysis scenarios is less well understood. In this paper, we examine the role of latency in the context of visual search, an essential task in data foraging and exploration using visualization. We conduct a series of studies on Amazon Mechanical Turk and find that under certain conditions, latency is a statistically significant predictor of visual search behavior, which is consistent with previous studies. However, our results also suggest that task type, task complexity, and other factors can modulate the effect of latency, in some cases rendering latency statistically insignificant in predicting user behavior. This suggests a more nuanced view of the role of latency than previously reported. Building on these results and the findings of prior studies, we propose design guidelines for measuring and interpreting the effects of latency when evaluating performance on visual search tasks.","article_number":"8809742","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8809742","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8809742/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8809742/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"1246","end_page":"1255","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":587,"insert_date":"20190822","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Task analysis","Complexity theory","Human computer interaction","Visualization","Data visualization","Delays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual search","latency","system response time","SRT"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Search","Visual Scanning","Search Behavior","Search Behaviour","Role In Latency","Visual Search Behaviour","Visual Search Behavior","Role Of Task Complexity","Statistical Significance","Visual System","Visual Task","User Behavior","User Behaviour","Design Guidelines","Search Task","Visual Search Task","Latency Effects","Results Of Experiments","Search Strategy","Target Location","Target Position","Interactive System","Experimental Task","Simple Task","User Performance","System Response Time","Visual Context","Choice Of Strategy","Recursive Partitioning Analysis","Visual Environment","Reduced Search Space","Visual Interface","Common Tasks","User Search"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934258","title":"Scale-Space Splatting: Reforming Spacetime for Cross-Scale Exploration of Integral Measures in Molecular Dynamics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":101,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Bergen","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100125","id":37087100125,"full_name":"Juraj Pálenik","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bergen"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Bergen","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085717963","id":37085717963,"full_name":"Jan Byška","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bergen","Masaryk University"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Bergen","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37265895700","id":37265895700,"full_name":"Stefan Bruckner","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bergen"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Bergen","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274158800","id":37274158800,"full_name":"Helwig Hauser","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bergen"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Understanding large amounts of spatiotemporal data from particle-based simulations, such as molecular dynamics, often relies on the computation and analysis of aggregate measures. These, however, by virtue of aggregation, hide structural information about the space/time localization of the studied phenomena. This leads to degenerate cases where the measures fail to capture distinct behaviour. In order to drill into these aggregate values, we propose a multi-scale visual exploration technique. Our novel representation, based on partial domain aggregation, enables the construction of a continuous scale-space for discrete datasets and the simultaneous exploration of scales in both space and time. We link these two scale-spaces in a scale-space space-time cube and model linked views as orthogonal slices through this cube, thus enabling the rapid identification of spatio-temporal patterns at multiple scales. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we showcase an advanced exploration of a protein-ligand simulation.","article_number":"8794520","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8794520","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8794520/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8794520/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"643","end_page":"653","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":462,"insert_date":"20190812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Computational modeling","Time series analysis","Atmospheric measurements","Particle measurements","Analytical models","Kernel"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Scale space","time-series","scientific simulation","multi-scale analysis","space-time cube","molecular dynamics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Molecular Dynamics","Spatiotemporal","Large Amount Of Data","Multiple Scales","Visualization Techniques","Visual Exploration","Time Series","Time-series","Gaussian Kernel","Gaussian Function","Characteristics Of Data","Features Of Data","Spatial Scales","Molecular Dynamics Simulations","Temporal Scales","Spatial Domain","Spatial Dependence","Domain Experts","Line Plots","Electrostatic Energy","Coulomb Energy","Time Axis","Spatial Aggregation","Continuous Field","Temporal Axis","Time-dependent Data","Time Dependent Data","Spatial Axis","Representative Time Series","Spatial Selectivity","Visual Analytics Tool","Ligand Position","Spatial Dimensions","Spatial Attributes","Green Vertical Line","Diffusion Equation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934370","title":"Deadeye Visualization Revisited: Investigation of Preattentiveness and Applicability in Virtual Environments","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":102,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Center of Visual Data Analysis and Computer Graphics (COVIDAG), University of Duisburg, Essen","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547173","id":37086547173,"full_name":"Andrey Krekhov","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Center of Visual Data Analysis and Computer Graphics (COVIDAG), University of Duisburg, Essen"]}},{"affiliation":"Center of Visual Data Analysis and Computer Graphics (COVIDAG), University of Duisburg, Essen","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087015385","id":37087015385,"full_name":"Sebastian Cmentowski","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Center of Visual Data Analysis and Computer Graphics (COVIDAG), University of Duisburg, Essen"]}},{"affiliation":"Center of Visual Data Analysis and Computer Graphics (COVIDAG), University of Duisburg, Essen","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100484","id":37087100484,"full_name":"Andre Waschk","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Center of Visual Data Analysis and Computer Graphics (COVIDAG), University of Duisburg, Essen"]}},{"affiliation":"Center of Visual Data Analysis and Computer Graphics (COVIDAG), University of Duisburg, Essen","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37548560500","id":37548560500,"full_name":"Jens Krüger","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Center of Visual Data Analysis and Computer Graphics (COVIDAG), University of Duisburg, Essen","SCI Institute, University of Utah"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Visualizations rely on highlighting to attract and guide our attention. To make an object of interest stand out independently from a number of distractors, the underlying visual cue, e.g., color, has to be preattentive. In our prior work, we introduced Deadeye as an instantly recognizable highlighting technique that works by rendering the target object for one eye only. In contrast to prior approaches, Deadeye excels by not modifying any visual properties of the target. However, in the case of 2D visualizations, the method requires an additional setup to allow dichoptic presentation, which is a considerable drawback. As a follow-up to requests from the community, this paper explores Deadeye as a highlighting technique for 3D visualizations, because such stereoscopic scenarios support dichoptic presentation out of the box. Deadeye suppresses binocular disparities for the target object, so we cannot assume the applicability of our technique as a given fact. With this motivation, the paper presents quantitative evaluations of Deadeye in VR, including configurations with multiple heterogeneous distractors as an important robustness challenge. After confirming the preserved preattentiveness (all average accuracies above 90 %) under such real-world conditions, we explore VR volume rendering as an example application scenario for Deadeye. We depict a possible workflow for integrating our technique, conduct an exploratory survey to demonstrate benefits and limitations, and finally provide related design implications.","article_number":"8805418","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8805418","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805418/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805418/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"547","end_page":"557","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":628,"insert_date":"20190819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Image color analysis","Rendering (computer graphics)","Visual systems","Color","Stereo image processing"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Popout","virtual reality","preattentive vision","volume rendering","dichoptic presentation","binocular rivalry"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Cues","Object Of Interest","Target Object","Visual Properties","Visual Attributes","Volume Rendering","Volumetric Rendering","Volume-rendering","Binocular Disparity","Fixation Disparity","Focal Point","Visual System","Real-world Scenarios","Viewing Angle","Monocular","Heterogeneous Conditions","Physical Demands","Peripheral Areas","Peripheral Area","Depth Estimation","Depth Perception","Depth Cues","Saccadic Movements","Side Note","Dominant Eye","Ocular Dominance","Mental Demands","Binocular Rivalry","Highlighted Regions","Depth Planes","3D Depth","Scientific Visualization","Temporal Demand","Grayscale","Gray Scale","Greyscale","Gray Level","Hypothesis H1"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934401","title":"Decoding a Complex Visualization in a Science Museum – An Empirical Study","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":103,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Exploratorium, San Francisco","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489269900","id":38489269900,"full_name":"Joyce Ma","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Exploratorium, San Francisco"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275869400","id":37275869400,"full_name":"Kwan-Liu Ma","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis"]}},{"affiliation":"Exploratorium, San Francisco","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233965200","id":38233965200,"full_name":"Jennifer Frazier","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Exploratorium, San Francisco"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"This study describes a detailed analysis of museum visitors' decoding process as they used a visualization designed to support exploration of a large, complex dataset.

From this study, we 1) identify a list of strategies people employ to perform each operation, 2) observe commonalities in strategies across operations, and 3) derive implications to help designers leverage direct manipulation of graphical encoding as a method for user interaction.","article_number":"8809678","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8809678","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8809678/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8809678/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"482","end_page":"491","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":551,"insert_date":"20190822","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Bars","Data visualization","Encoding","Visualization","Image color analysis","Tools","Instruments"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Direct Manipulation","Data Visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Direct Use","Direct Utilization","Direct Manipulation","Interactive Methods","Interactive Method","Visualization Tool","Prototype","Instrumentation","Backtracking","Target Value","Visual Representation","Formation Of Interactions","Bar Charts","Degree Of Agreement","Interactive Tool","Interactive Visualization","Far Left","Extreme Left","Visual Markers","Color Bar","Colour Bar","Visual Design","Point Size","Bar Height","Height Of Each Bar","Color Points","Color Of Each Point","Bar Width","Bar Widths","Histogram Bars","Tick Marks"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934658","title":"LightGuider: Guiding Interactive Lighting Design using Suggestions, Provenance, and Quality Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":105,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"VRVis Forschungs GmbH","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102461","id":37087102461,"full_name":"Andreas Walch","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VRVis Forschungs GmbH"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Delft","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085716300","id":37085716300,"full_name":"Michael Schwärzler","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Delft"]}},{"affiliation":"VRVis Forschungs GmbH","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085757274","id":37085757274,"full_name":"Christian Luksch","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VRVis Forschungs GmbH"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Delft","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37829332900","id":37829332900,"full_name":"Elmar Eisemann","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Delft"]}},{"affiliation":"Visual Analytics research division, TU Wien","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37847052600","id":37847052600,"full_name":"Theresia Gschwandtner","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Analytics research division, TU Wien"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"LightGuider is a novel guidance-based approach to interactive lighting design, which typically consists of interleaved 3D modeling operations and light transport simulations.

It is often arduous to analyze large amounts of recorded think-aloud sessions and few UX practitioners have an opportunity to get a second perspective during their analysis due to time and resource constraints. Inspired by the recent research that shows subtle verbalization and speech patterns tend to occur when users encounter usability problems, we take the first step to design and evaluate an intelligent visual analytics tool that leverages such patterns to identify usability problem encounters and present them to UX practitioners to assist their analysis. We first conducted and recorded think-aloud sessions, and then extracted textual and acoustic features from the recordings and trained machine learning (ML) models to detect problem encounters. Next, we iteratively designed and developed a visual analytics tool, VisTA, which enables dynamic investigation of think-aloud sessions with a timeline visualization of ML predictions and input features. We conducted a between-subjects laboratory study to compare three conditions, i.e., VisTA, VisTASimple (no visualization of the ML's input features), and Baseline (no ML information at all), with 30 UX professionals. The findings show that UX professionals identified more problem encounters when using VisTA than Baseline by leveraging the problem visualization as an overview, anticipations, and anchors as well as the feature visualization as a means to understand what ML considers and omits. Our findings also provide insights into how they treated ML, dealt with (dis)agreement with ML, and reviewed the videos (i.e., play, pause, and rewind).","article_number":"8807301","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8807301","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807301/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807301/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"343","end_page":"352","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1009,"insert_date":"20190820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Usability","Visual analytics","Tools","Machine intelligence","Feature extraction","Machine learning"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Think-aloud","visual analytics","machine intelligence","user study","usability problems","session review behavior","UX practices"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Computational Intelligence","Machine Intelligence","Think-aloud Sessions","Machine Learning","Machine-learning","Machine Learning Models","Resource Constraints","Budget Constraints","Input Features","User Experience","Visual Analysis","Visualization Tool","Iterative Design","Loop Design","Train Machine Learning","Machine Learning Prediction","Usability Problems","Think-aloud Protocols","Visual Analytics Tool","Convolutional Neural Network","Support Vector Machine","Test Session","Recurrent Neural Network","Speech Rate","Effective Machine Learning","Speech Features","Speech Characteristics","Term Frequency-inverse Document Frequency","Inverse Document Frequency","TF-IDF","Support Vector Machine Model","First Pass","User Testing","Confirmation Bias","Coffee Machine","Overprecision","False Precision","Spurious Precision","Over Precision"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934264","title":"The Validity, Generalizability and Feasibility of Summative Evaluation Methods in Visual Analytics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":107,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100488","id":37087100488,"full_name":"Mosab Khayat","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Colorado Boulder","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089053323","id":37089053323,"full_name":"Morteza Karimzadeh","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Colorado Boulder"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282598900","id":37282598900,"full_name":"David S.

However, matrices-similar to node-link diagrams-are most effective if their layout reveals the underlying data topology. Given the many developed algorithms, a practical problem arises: “Which matrix reordering algorithm should I choose for my dataset at hand?” To make matters worse, different reordering algorithms applied to the same dataset may let significantly different visual matrix patterns emerge. This leads to the question of trustworthiness and explainability of these fully automated, often heuristic, black-box processes. We present GUIRO, a Visual Analytics system that helps novices, network analysts, and algorithm designers to open the black-box. Users can investigate the usefulness and expressiveness of 70 accessible matrix reordering algorithms. For network analysts, we introduce a novel model space representation and two interaction techniques for a user-guided reordering of rows or columns, and especially groups thereof (submatrix reordering). These novel techniques contribute to the understanding of the global and local dataset topology. We support algorithm designers by giving them access to 16 reordering quality metrics and visual exploration means for comparing reordering implementations on a row/column permutation level. We evaluated GUIRO in a guided explorative user study with 12 subjects, a case study demonstrating its usefulness in a real-world scenario, and through an expert study gathering feedback on our design decisions. We found that our proposed methods help even inexperienced users to understand matrix patterns and allow a user-guided steering of reordering algorithms. GUIRO helps to increase the transparency of matrix reordering algorithms, thus helping a broad range of users to get a better insight into the complex reordering process, in turn supporting data and reordering algorithm insights.","article_number":"8807245","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8807245","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807245/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807245/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"184","end_page":"194","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":752,"insert_date":"20190820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Data visualization","Indexes","Topology","Measurement","Task analysis","Partitioning algorithms"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analytics","matrix","black-box algorithms","seriation","ordering","sorting","steerable algorithm","interaction","2D projection"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Matrix Reordering","Permutation","User Study","Visual Analysis","Algorithm Design","Quality Metrics","Submatrix","Submatrices","Visual Patterns","Design Decisions","Matrix Representation","Interaction Techniques","Horizontal Plane","Horizontal Direction","Horizontal Distance","Local Patterns","Quality Criteria","Restrictive Criteria","Quality Criterion","Within-subject Design","Repeated-measures Design","Repeated Measures Design","Interactive Visualization","Combination Of Patterns","Interpretation Of Patterns","Choice Of Algorithm","Automatic Approach","Black Box Algorithms","Network Analyst","Projective Space","Linear Arrangement","Visual Literacy","Projection Views","Matrix Plot","Traveling Salesman Problem","User Selection","Microservices"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934367","title":"Analysis of the Near-Wall Flow in a Turbine Cascade by Splat Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":110,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Institute of Computer Science, Leipzig University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100148","id":37087100148,"full_name":"Baldwin Nsonga","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, Leipzig University"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Computer Science, Leipzig University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282574800","id":37282574800,"full_name":"Gerik Scheuermann","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, Leipzig University"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Software and Multimedia Technology, TU Dresden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37565742800","id":37565742800,"full_name":"Stefan Gumhold","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Software and Multimedia Technology, TU Dresden"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Fluid Mechanics, TU Dresden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087102807","id":37087102807,"full_name":"Jordi Ventosa-Molina","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Fluid Mechanics, TU Dresden"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Fluid Mechanics, TU Dresden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087099856","id":37087099856,"full_name":"Denis Koschichow","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Fluid Mechanics, TU Dresden"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Fluid Mechanics, TU Dresden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101680","id":37087101680,"full_name":"Jochen Fröhlich","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Fluid Mechanics, TU Dresden"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Turbines are essential components of jet planes and power plants.

Since it is known that splat events have a substantial impact on the heat transfer between flow and immersed surfaces, we adapt a splat detection and visualization method to a turbine cascade simulation in this case study. Because splat events are small phenomena, we use a direct numerical simulation resolving the turbulence in the flow as the base of our analysis.

Our void-and-cluster sampling technique finds a representative subset that is optimally distributed in the spatial domain with respect to the blue noise property. In addition, it can adapt to a given density function, which we use to sample regions of high complexity in the multivariate value domain more densely. Moreover, our sampling technique implicitly defines an ordering on the samples that enables progressive data loading and a continuous level-of-detail representation. We extend our technique to sample time-dependent trajectories, for example pathlines in a time interval, using an efficient and iterative approach.

While it is often prudent to avoid such projects, we argue it can be beneficial to engage them in some cases as the visualization process can help refine data collection, solving a “chicken and egg” problem of having the data and tools to analyze it. We found this to be the case in the domain of task parallel computing where such data and tooling is an open area of research. Despite these hurdles, we conducted a design study. Through a tightly-coupled iterative design process, we built Atria, a multi-view execution graph visualization to support performance analysis. Atria simplifies the initial representation of the execution graph by aggregating nodes as related to their line of code. We deployed Atria on multiple platforms, some requiring design alteration. We describe how we adapted the design study methodology to the “moving target” of both the data and the domain experts' concerns and how this movement kept both the visualization and programming project healthy. We reflect on our process and discuss what factors allow the project to be successful in the presence of changing data and user needs.","article_number":"8805434","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8805434","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805434/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805434/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"1118","end_page":"1128","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":557,"insert_date":"20190819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Task analysis","Data visualization","Computational modeling","Runtime","Tools","Parallel processing","Data collection"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["design studies","software visualization","parallel computing","graph visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Parallelization","Parallel Computing","Moving Target","Program In The Presence","Design Process","Domain Experts","Chicken-and-egg","Chicken And Eggs","Chicken And Egg","Source Code","Data Compression","Management Programs","Program Directors","Project Management","Development Data","Evolutionary Data","Nodes In The Graph","Mental Models","Project Goals","Interactive Visualization","Debugging","Presence Of Studies","Node Attributes","Nodal Properties","Jupyter Notebook","Aspects Of The Project","Intermediate Representation","Execution Mode","Subset Of Nodes","Evaluation Session","Session Rating","High-level Goals","Higher-level Goals","Tree Visualization","High-level Tasks","Higher-level Tasks"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934612","title":"Multi-Scale Procedural Animations of Microtubule Dynamics Based on Measured Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":113,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"TU Wien","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086226921","id":37086226921,"full_name":"Tobias Klein","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Wien"]}},{"affiliation":"KAUST","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282726800","id":37282726800,"full_name":"Ivan Viola","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["KAUST"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Wien, VRVis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284271200","id":37284271200,"full_name":"Eduard Gröller","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Wien, VRVis"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Wien, Nanographics GmbH","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086231000","id":37086231000,"full_name":"Peter Mindek","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Wien, Nanographics GmbH"]}}]},"access_type":"CCBY - IEEE is not the copyright holder of this material.

One example for such structures are microtubules, which are present in every eukaryotic cell. They are part of the cytoskeleton maintaining the shape of the cell and playing a key role in the cell division. In this paper, we propose a scientifically-accurate multi-scale procedural model of microtubule dynamics as a novel application scenario for procedural animation, which can generate visualizations of their overall shape, molecular structure, as well as animations of the dynamic behaviour of their growth and disassembly. The model is spanning from tens of micrometers down to atomic resolution. All the aspects of the model are driven by scientific data. The advantage over a traditional, manual animation approach is that when the underlying data change, for instance due to new evidence, the model can be recreated immediately. The procedural animation concept is presented in its generic form, with several novel extensions, facilitating an easy translation to other domains with emergent multi-scale behavior.","article_number":"8807314","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8807314","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807314/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807314/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"622","end_page":"632","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1109,"insert_date":"20190820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Animation","Biological system modeling","Data visualization","Computational modeling","Visualization","Data models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Procedural modeling","molecular visualization","animation","microtubules"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Microtubule Dynamics","Molecular Structure","Biologists","Multiscale Model","Computer Graphics","Part Of The Cytoskeleton","Hypothesis Testing","Tubulin","Dynamic Conditions","Dynamic State","Brownian Motion","Brownian Diffusion","Random Motion","Random Walk","Domain Experts","Centrosome","Depth Of Field","Depth-of-field","Real-time Visualization","Persistence Length","Persistence Lengths","Interpolation Function","Dynamic Instability","Flat Sheet","Protofilaments","Microtubule Ends","Cellular Scale","Microtubule Structure","Molecular Visualization","Distinct Scales","Microtubule Growth","Molecular Scale","Years Of Experience","Microtubule Length","Microtubule Lengths","Use Of Systems"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934806","title":"GenerativeMap: Visualization and Exploration of Dynamic Density Maps via Generative Learning Model","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":114,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100107","id":37087100107,"full_name":"Chen Chen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38008320400","id":38008320400,"full_name":"Changbo Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086942310","id":37086942310,"full_name":"Xue Bai","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089259258","id":37089259258,"full_name":"Peiying Zhang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086945430","id":37086945430,"full_name":"Chenhui Li","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The density map is widely used for data sampling, time-varying detection, ensemble representation, etc. The visualization of dynamic evolution is a challenging task when exploring spatiotemporal data.

Image generation is a well-known topic in deep learning, and a variety of generating models have been promoted in recent years. In this paper, we introduce a general pipeline called GenerativeMap to extract dynamics of density maps by generating interpolation information. First, a trained generative model comprises an important part of our approach, which can generate nonlinear and natural results by implementing a few parameters. Second, a visual presentation is proposed to show the density change, which is combined with the level of detail and blue noise sampling for a better visual effect. Third, for dynamic visualization of large-scale density maps, we extend this approach to show the evolution in regions of interest, which costs less to overcome the drawback of the learning-based generative model. We demonstrate our method on different types of cases, and we evaluate and compare the approach from multiple aspects. The results help identify the effectiveness of our approach and confirm its applicability in different scenarios.","article_number":"8807296","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8807296","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807296/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807296/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"216","end_page":"226","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1091,"insert_date":"20190820","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Gallium nitride","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Pipelines","Task analysis","Interpolation","Deep learning"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Density map","deep learning","spatiotemporal data","generative model"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Density Map","Deep Learning","Visual Effects","Visual Events","Image Generation","Spatiotemporal Data","General Pipeline","Training Dataset","Training Data Set","High-resolution Images","Change Process","Generalization Ability","General Intelligence","General Cognitive Ability","Deep Learning Models","Random Distribution","Generative Adversarial Networks","Adversarial Learning","Diffusion Model","Target Image","Latent Space","Embedding Space","Real-world Scenarios","Vector Field","Part Of The Image","Smooth Transition","Variational Autoencoder","Air Quality Index","Air Pollution Index","Physical Rules","Morphing","Latent Vector","Large Image","Smoothing","Linear Interpolation","Complex Models","Gaussian Blur","Gaussian Smoothing"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934603","title":"MetricsVis: A Visual Analytics System for Evaluating Employee Performance in Public Safety Agencies","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":115,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085454267","id":37085454267,"full_name":"Jieqiong Zhao","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089053323","id":37089053323,"full_name":"Morteza Karimzadeh","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University","University of Colorado"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087099927","id":37087099927,"full_name":"Luke S.

To facilitate this process, we summarize common organizational performance analyses into four visual exploration task categories. Additionally, we develop MetricsVis, a visual analytics system composed of multiple coordinated views to support the dynamic evaluation and comparison of individual, team, and organizational performance in public safety organizations. MetricsVis provides four primary visual components to expedite performance evaluation: (1) a priority adjustment view to support direct manipulation on evaluation metrics; (2) a reorderable performance matrix to demonstrate the details of individual employees; (3) a group performance view that highlights aggregate performance and individual contributions for each group; and (4) a projection view illustrating employees with similar specialties to facilitate shift assignments and training. We demonstrate the usability of our framework with two case studies from medium-sized law enforcement agencies and highlight its broader applicability to other domains.","article_number":"8805443","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8805443","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805443/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805443/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"1193","end_page":"1203","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":896,"insert_date":"20190819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Organizations","Task analysis","Data visualization","Performance evaluation","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Organizational performance analysis","multi-dimensional data","hierarchical relationships","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Employee Performance","Employee Performance Management","Visual Analytics System","Public Safety Agencies","Evaluate Employee Performance","Individual Performance","Visual Task","Kinetic Rate","Dynamic Rate","Dynamic Evaluation","Team Performance","Team Functioning","Individual Employees","Projection Views","Rate Efficiency","Evaluation Of Efficiency","Police Officers","Multidimensional Data","Multidimensional Analysis","Night Shift","Day Shift","Domain Experts","Interactive Visualization","Job Type","Top Performers","Compact Space","Organizational Objectives","Entire Organization","Job Categories","Resource Allocation Scheme","Resource Allocation Strategy","Counterproductive Work Behavior","Counterproductive Behavior","Patrol Officers","Individual Details","Traffic Stops","Organizational Priorities"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934313","title":"Accelerated Monte Carlo Rendering of Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponents","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":116,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics Laboratory, ETH Zürich","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086993394","id":37086993394,"full_name":"Irene Baeza Rojo","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics Laboratory, ETH Zürich"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics Laboratory, ETH Zürich","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275694700","id":37275694700,"full_name":"Markus Gross","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics Laboratory, ETH Zürich"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics Laboratory, ETH Zürich","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085416142","id":37085416142,"full_name":"Tobias Günther","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics Laboratory, ETH Zürich"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Time-dependent fluid flows often contain numerous hyperbolic Lagrangian coherent structures, which act as transport barriers that guide the advection. The finite-time Lyapunov exponent is a commonly-used approximation to locate these repelling or attracting structures. Especially on large numerical simulations, the FTLE ridges can become arbitrarily sharp and very complex. Thus, the discrete sampling onto a grid for a subsequent direct volume rendering is likely to miss sharp ridges in the visualization. For this reason, an unbiased Monte Carlo-based rendering approach was recently proposed that treats the FTLE field as participating medium with single scattering. This method constructs a ground truth rendering without discretization, but it is prohibitively slow with render times in the order of days or weeks for a single image. In this paper, we accelerate the rendering process significantly, which allows us to compute video sequence of high-resolution FTLE animations in a much more reasonable time frame. For this, we follow two orthogonal approaches to improve on the rendering process: the volumetric light path integration in gradient domain and an acceleration of the transmittance estimation. We analyze the convergence and performance of the proposed method and demonstrate the approach by rendering complex FTLE fields in several 3D vector fields.","article_number":"8805455","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8805455","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805455/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805455/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"708","end_page":"718","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":427,"insert_date":"20190819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Acceleration","Monte Carlo methods","Scattering","Feature extraction","Data visualization","Animation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Scientific visualization","Monte Carlo","feature extraction","finite-time Lyapunov exponents","gradient domain","Fourier"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Unbiased","Unbiased Estimates","Single Image","Vector Field","Transportation Barriers","Volume Rendering","Volumetric Rendering","Volume-rendering","Sharp Ridge","Extinction","Quenching","Light Source","Hierarchical Structure","Hierarchical Organization","Step Function","Piecewise Constant","Light Transmission","Optical Depth","Optical Thickness","Homogeneous Medium","Homogenous Medium","Ground Truth Image","Sine And Cosine","Fourier Coefficients","Light Rays","Ray Optics","Continuous Estimation","Continuum Approximation","Continuous Approximation","Large Eddy Simulation","Large-eddy Simulation","Flow Map","Monte Carlo Iterations","Discretization Error","Monte Carlo Integration","Monte-Carlo Integration","Multiple Scattering","Multiple-scattering","Multiplicative Scatter","Fourier Basis","Estimation Of Eq","Tropopause","Frequency Band","Gradient Approximation","Gradient Estimation","Ray Casting","Ray Shooting"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934657","title":"OD Morphing: Balancing Simplicity with Faithfulness for OD Bundling","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":117,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"National University of Singapore","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085832531","id":37085832531,"full_name":"Yan Lyu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["National University of Singapore"]}},{"affiliation":"Southeast University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100238","id":37087100238,"full_name":"Xu Liu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Southeast University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100762","id":37087100762,"full_name":"Hanyi Chen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100314","id":37087100314,"full_name":"Arpan Mangal","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi"]}},{"affiliation":"Chongqing University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38269608600","id":38269608600,"full_name":"Kai Liu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Chongqing University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Chongqing University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38067271700","id":38067271700,"full_name":"Chao Chen","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Chongqing University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"National University of Singapore","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086162699","id":37086162699,"full_name":"Brian Lim","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["National University of Singapore"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"OD bundling is a promising method to identify key origin-destination (OD) patterns, but the bundling can mislead the interpretation of actual trajectories traveled.

There is an increasing need to analyze the data produced as output by these simulations. Simultaneously, topological analysis tools are emerging as powerful methods for investigating simulation data. However, most of the current approaches to topological analysis have had limited application to HO-FEM simulation data for two reasons. First, the current topological tools are designed for linear data (polynomial degree one), but the polynomial degree of the data output by these simulations is typically higher (routinely up to polynomial degree six). Second, the simulation data and derived quantities of the simulation data have discontinuities at element boundaries, and these discontinuities do not match the input requirements for the topological tools. One solution to both issues is to transform the high-order data to achieve low-order, continuous inputs for topological analysis. Nevertheless, there has been little work evaluating the possible transformation choices and their downstream effect on the topological analysis. We perform an empirical study to evaluate two commonly used data transformation methodologies along with the recently introduced L-SIAC filter for processing high-order simulation data. Our results show diverse behaviors are possible. We offer some guidance about how best to consider a pipeline of topological analysis of HO-FEM simulations with the currently available implementations of topological analysis.","article_number":"8805451","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8805451","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805451/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805451/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"162","end_page":"172","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":324,"insert_date":"20190819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data models","Finite element analysis","Tools","Data visualization","Level set","Analytical models","Transforms"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["High-Order Finite Element Methods","Filtering Techniques","Scalar Field Visualization","Topological Analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Transformation","Topological Analysis","Simulated Data","Polynomial Of Degree","Boundary Element","High-order Method","Higher-order Method","Higher-order Methods","High-order Methods","Interpolation","Sampling Rate","Downstream Analysis","Critical Point","Lower Threshold","Shape Features","Characteristic Shape","Characteristic Length","Characteristic Lengths","Regular Grid","Cartesian Grid","Grid Structure","Rectangular Grid","Dataset Characteristics","Dataset Features","Vector Field","Topological Features","Topological Characteristics","GHz Processor","Increase In Resolution","Orange Bars","Secondary Vortices","Secondary Vortex","Simple Topology","Persistent Features","Persistent Characteristics","Circular Cylinder","Polynomial Expansion","Highlighted Regions","Elements Of Degree","Low Persistence","Isosurface","Red Arrows"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934333","title":"Multiscale Visual Drilldown for the Analysis of Large Ensembles of Multi-Body Protein Complexes","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":119,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Masaryk University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085718278","id":37085718278,"full_name":"Katarína Furmanová","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Masaryk University"]}},{"affiliation":"Masaryk University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085818849","id":37085818849,"full_name":"Adam Jurčík","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Masaryk University"]}},{"affiliation":"Masaryk University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085711031","id":37085711031,"full_name":"Barbora Kozlíková","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Masaryk University"]}},{"affiliation":"Univ. of Bergen","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274158800","id":37274158800,"full_name":"Helwig Hauser","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Univ. of Bergen"]}},{"affiliation":"Masaryk University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085717963","id":37085717963,"full_name":"Jan Byška","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Masaryk University","Univ. of Bergen"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"When studying multi-body protein complexes, biochemists use computational tools that can suggest hundreds or thousands of their possible spatial configurations. However, it is not feasible to experimentally verify more than only a very small subset of them. In this paper, we propose a novel multiscale visual drilldown approach that was designed in tight collaboration with proteomic experts, enabling a systematic exploration of the configuration space. Our approach takes advantage of the hierarchical structure of the data - from the whole ensemble of protein complex configurations to the individual configurations, their contact interfaces, and the interacting amino acids. Our new solution is based on interactively linked 2D and 3D views for individual hierarchy levels. At each level, we offer a set of selection and filtering operations that enable the user to narrow down the number of configurations that need to be manually scrutinized. Furthermore, we offer a dedicated filter interface, which provides the users with an overview of the applied filtering operations and enables them to examine their impact on the explored ensemble. This way, we maintain the history of the exploration process and thus enable the user to return to an earlier point of the exploration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two case studies conducted by collaborating proteomic experts.","article_number":"8805432","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8805432","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805432/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805432/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":8911289,"publication_year":2020,"publication_date":"Jan. 2020","start_page":"843","end_page":"852","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":433,"insert_date":"20190819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Proteins","Tools","Visualization","Amino acids","Proteomics","Task analysis","Space exploration"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Molecular visualization","data filtering","coordinated and multiple views"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Protein Complexes","Ensemble Analysis","Interactive","Hierarchical Structure","Hierarchical Organization","Selection Operator","Levels Of Hierarchy","Filtration Performance","Filtering Operation","Exploration Process","Contact Interface","Number Of Configurations","Complex Configurations","Amino Acid Interactions","Focus Group","Scoring Function","Individual Proteins","Spatial Arrangement","Bar Charts","Domain Experts","Protein Pairs","Spatial Properties","Spatial Distribution Of Properties","Amino Acid Pairs","Different Levels Of Hierarchy","Residual Matrix","Residual Matrices","Different Levels Of Detail","Configuration Selection","Docking Tools","Ensemble Size","Van Der Waals Energy","Interface Size","Complex Prediction"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934557","title":"OntoPlot: A Novel Visualisation for Non-hierarchical Associations in Large Ontologies","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":120,"volume":"26","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Monash University, Australia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087100295","id":37087100295,"full_name":"Ying Yang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University, Australia"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University, Australia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37867777700","id":37867777700,"full_name":"Michael Wybrow","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University, Australia"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University, Australia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086053235","id":37086053235,"full_name":"Yuan-Fang Li","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University, Australia"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University, Australia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085649844","id":37085649844,"full_name":"Tobias Czauderna","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University, Australia"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Michigan, Medical School, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086604784","id":37086604784,"full_name":"Yongqun He","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Michigan, Medical School, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Ontologies are formal representations of concepts and complex relationships among them. They have been widely used to capture comprehensive domain knowledge in areas such as biology and medicine, where large and complex ontologies can contain hundreds of thousands of concepts. Especially due to the large size of ontologies, visualisation is useful for authoring, exploring and understanding their underlying data. Existing ontology visualisation tools generally focus on the hierarchical structure, giving much less emphasis to non-hierarchical associations. In this paper we present OntoPlot, a novel visualisation specifically designed to facilitate the exploration of all concept associations whilst still showing an ontology's large hierarchical structure. This hybrid visualisation combines icicle plots, visual compression techniques and interactivity, improving space-efficiency and reducing visual structural complexity. We conducted a user study with domain experts to evaluate the usability of OntoPlot, comparing it with the de facto ontology editor Protégé. The results confirm that OntoPlot attains our design goals for association-related tasks and is strongly favoured by domain experts.","article_number":"8809833","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8809833","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8809833/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8809833/","publication_title":"IEEE
