The need for visualizing the interiors of objects frequently arises in medical visualization and CAD modeling. The goal of such visualizations is to display the model in a way that the human observer can easily understand the relationship between the different parts of the surface. While there exist excellent methods for visualizing surfaces that are inside one another (nested surfaces), the determination of which parts of the surface are interior is currently done manually. Our automatic method for interior classification takes a sampling approach using a collection of direction vectors. Polygons are said to be interior to the model if they are not visible in any of these viewing directions from a point outside the model. Once we have identified polygons as being inside or outside the model, these can be textured or have different opacities applied to them so that the whole model can be rendered in a more comprehensible manner. An additional consideration for some models is that they may have holes or tunnels running through them that are connected to the exterior surface. Although an external observer can see into these holes, it is often desirable to mark the walls of such tunnels as being part of the interior of a model. In order to allow this modified classification of the interior, we use morphological operators to close all the holes of the model. An input model is used together with its closed version to provide a better classification of the portions of the original model.","article_number":"885723","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885723","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885723/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885723/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization 2000.

An intermediate image is used to exploit the coherences among neighboring frames. The pixels in the intermediate image are first rendered by a ray-casting method and then warped to the intermediate image at the current viewpoint and view direction. We use an offset buffer to record the precise positions of these pixels in the intermediate image. Every frame is generated in three steps: warping the intermediate image onto the frame, filling in holes, and selectively rendering a group of \"old\" pixels. By dynamically adjusting the number of those \"old\" pixels in the last step, the workload at every frame can be balanced. The pixels generated by the last two steps make contributions to the new intermediate image. Unlike occasional keyframes in conventional image-based rendering, which need to be totally re-rendered, intermediate images only need to be partially updated at every frame. In this way, we guarantee more stable frame rates and more uniform image qualities. The intermediate image can be warped efficiently by a modified incremental 3D warp algorithm. As a specific application, we demonstrate our technique with a voxel-based terrain rendering system.","article_number":"885702","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885702","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885702/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885702/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization 2000.

By employing 2D texture mapping our second extension realizes the hardware-accelerated rendering of multiple shaded isosurfaces within the PT algorithm without reconstructing the isosurfaces. Additionally, two methods are presented to combine projected tetrahedral volumes with isosurfaces. The time complexity of all our algorithms is linear in the number of tetrahedra and does neither depend on the number of isosurfaces nor on the employed transfer functions.","article_number":"885683","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885683","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885683/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885683/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization 2000.

We also describe a conversion process for re-mapping large-scale isosurfaces to have subdivision connectivity and fair parameterizations so that the new wavelet transform can be used for compression and visualization. The main idea enabling our wavelet transform is the circular symmetrization of the filters in irregular neighborhoods, which replaces the traditional separation of filters into two 1D passes. Our wavelet transform uses polygonal base meshes to represent surface topology, from which a Catmull-Clark-style subdivision hierarchy is generated. The details between these levels of resolution are quickly computed and compactly stored as wavelet coefficients. The isosurface conversion process begins with a contour triangulation computed using conventional techniques, which we subsequently simplify with a variant edge-collapse procedure, followed by an edge-removal process. This provides a coarse initial base mesh, which is subsequently refined, relaxed and attracted in phases to converge to the contour. The conversion is designed to produce smooth, untangled and minimally-skewed parameterizations which improves the subsequent compression after applying the transform. We have demonstrated our conversion and transform for an isosurface obtained from a high-resolution turbulent-mixing hydrodynamics simulation, showing the potential for compression and level-of-detail visualization.","article_number":"885720","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885720","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885720/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885720/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization 2000.

Our method can be used for a variety of segmentation needs with little or no modification. It aims at fulfilling the dual and often conflicting requirements of a fast and accurate segmentation and also eliminates the undesirable partial volume effect which contemporary approaches cannot. For segmentation and digital cleansing, we use the peculiar characteristics exhibited by the intersection of any two distinct-intensity regions. To detect these intersections we cast rays through the volume, which we call the segmentation rays as they assist in the segmentation. We then associate a certain task of reconstruction and classification with each intersection the ray detects. We further use volumetric contrast enhancement to reconstruct surface lost by segmentation (if any), which aids in improving the quality of the volume rendering.","article_number":"885674","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885674","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885674/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885674/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization 2000.

This problem becomes two-fold for mesoscale weather models that operate in near-real-time at cloud-scale resolution. For example, typical approaches to vector field visualization (e.g., wind) are based upon global methods, which may not illustrate detailed structure. In addition, such computations employ multi-resolution meshes to capture small-scale phenomena, which are not properly reflected in both vector and scalar realizations. To address the former critical point analysis and simple bandpass filtering of wind fields is employed for better seed point identification of streamline calculations. For the latter, an encapsulation of nested computational meshes is developed for general realization. It is then combined with the seed point calculation for an improved vector visualization of multi-resolution weather forecasting data.","article_number":"885745","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885745","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885745/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885745/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization 2000.

These account for changes of apparent geometry, color and brightness of the objects. It is shown how the relativistic effects can be taken into account by a modification of the plenoptic function. Therefore, all known image-based nonrelativistic rendering methods can easily be extended to incorporate relativistic rendering. Our implementation allows interactive viewing of relativistic panoramas and the production of movies which show super-fast travel. Examples in the form of snapshots and film sequences are included.","article_number":"885709","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885709","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885709/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885709/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization 2000.

However, visualizing protein dynamics by animating atom trajectories does not provide satisfactory results. When the trajectory is sampled with large times steps, the impression of smooth motion will be destroyed due to the effects of temporal aliasing. Sampling with small time steps will result in the camouflage of interesting motions. In this case study, we discuss techniques for the interactive 3D visualization of the dynamics of the photoactive yellow protein. We use essential dynamics methods to filter out uninteresting atom motions from the larger concerted motions. In this way, clear and concise 3D animations of protein motions can be produced. In addition, we discuss various interactive techniques that allow exploration of the essential subspace of the protein. We discuss the merits of these techniques when applied to the analysis of the yellow protein.","article_number":"885733","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885733","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885733/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885733/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization 2000.

In comparing these datasets, there is no one-to-one correspondence. We show the comparison by performing quantitative capturing of large scale observable features. The comparisons are needed not only to improve the relevance of the simulations to the field observations, but also to enable real time adjustment of shipboard data collection systems. Our approach for comparing simulation and field datasets is to use skeletonization and centerline representation. Features representing plumes are skeletonized. Skeleton points are used to construct a centerline and to quantify plume properties on planes normal to the centerline. These skeleton points are further used to construct an idealized cone representing a plume isosurface. The difference between the plume feature and the cone is identified as protrusions of turbulent eddies. Comparison of the simulation and field data sets through these abstractions illustrates how these abstractions characterize a plume.","article_number":"885737","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885737","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885737/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885737/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization 2000.

As part of the Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) Programming Environment and Training (PET) project, a special visualization tool was developed. Some problematic issues in efficiently handling and processing the data format from the computational model were resolved through this work. Also, a sophisticated system for dynamically generating visualizations of the data has been implemented. In addition, the development of the VisGen library allows for high-level, flexible control of the VTK graphics pipeline. Coupled with an easy-to-use interface to the application, this allows the user a lot of control over the graphical representation of the data. Once the user has a representation he/she is pleased with, a wide variety of options are provided for how this can be used in presentation, or for sharing with remote colleagues. This paper includes discussions on how the simulation data are handled efficiently, as well as how the issues of usability, flexibility and collaboration are addressed.

We present a filtering technique based on the vorticity of the vector fields to eliminate the less interesting and sometimes sporadic critical points in a multiresolution fashion. The neighboring regions of the preserved features, which are characterized by strong shear and circulation, are potential locations of weather instability.

A spatial finite element discretization on arbitrary unstructured triangular meshes and a semi-implicit finite difference discretization in time are the building blocks of the easy to code algorithm presented. The systems of linear equations in each timestep are solved by appropriate, preconditioned iterative solvers.

Since about 1995, several articles have dealt with the coding of meshes, using for most of them the following approach: the vertices of the mesh are coded in an order that partially contains the topology of the mesh. In the same time, some simple rules attempt to predict the position of each vertex from the positions of its neighbors that have been previously coded. We describe a compression algorithm whose principle is completely different: the coding order of the vertices is used to compress their coordinates, and then the topology of the mesh is reconstructed from the vertices. This algorithm achieves compression ratios that are slightly better than those of the currently available algorithms, and moreover, it allows progressive and interactive transmission of the meshes.","article_number":"885711","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885711","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885711/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885711/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization 2000.

The primary goal of our seeding strategy is to capture flow patterns in the vicinity of critical points in the flow field, even as the density of streamlines is reduced. Secondary goals are to place streamlines such that there is sufficient coverage in non-critical regions, and to vary the streamline placements and lengths so that the overall presentation is aesthetically pleasing (avoid clustering of streamlines, avoid sharp discontinuities across several streamlines, etc.). The procedure is straightforward and non-iterative. First, critical points are identified. Next, the flow field is segmented into regions, each containing a single critical point. The critical point in each region is then seeded with a template depending on the type of critical point. Finally, additional seed points are randomly distributed around the field using a Poisson disk distribution to minimize closely spaced seed points. The main advantage of this approach is that it does not miss the features around critical points. Since the strategy is not image-guided, and hence not view dependent, significant savings are possible when examining flow fields from different viewpoints, especially for 3D flow fields.","article_number":"885690","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885690","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885690/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885690/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization 2000.

Physics-based volume rendering approaches create images which may match the appearance of translucent materials in nature but may not embody important structural details. Transfer function approaches allow flexible design of the volume appearance but generally require substantial hand-tuning for each new data set in order to be effective. We introduce the volume illustration approach, combining the familiarity of a physics-based illumination model with the ability to enhance important features using non-photorealistic rendering techniques. Since the features to be enhanced are defined on the basis of local volume characteristics rather than volume sample values, the application of volume illustration techniques requires less manual tuning than the design of a good transfer function. Volume illustration provides a flexible unified framework for enhancing structural perception of volume models through the amplification of features and the addition of illumination effects.","article_number":"885694","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885694","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885694/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885694/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization 2000.

While recent work has addressed the issues of geometric registration, rendering architectures, and human interfaces, there has been relatively little work on photometric calibration in general, and photometric non-uniformity in particular. For example, as a result of differences in the photometric characteristics of projectors, the color and intensity of a large area display varies from place to place. Further, the imagery typically appears brighter at the regions of overlap between adjacent projectors. We analyze and classify the causes of photometric non-uniformity in a tiled display. We then propose a methodology for determining corrections designed to achieve uniformity, that can correct for the photometric variations across a tiled projector display in real time using per channel color look-up-tables (LUT).","article_number":"885684","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885684","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885684/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885684/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization 2000.

Subsequently an iterative multi-scale force-based solver refines the initial mesh into a semi-regular mesh with geometrically adaptive sampling rate and good aspect ratio triangles. The coarse mesh extraction is performed using a new approach we call surface wavefront propagation. A set of discrete iso-distance ribbons are rapidly built and connected while respecting the topology of the iso-surface implied by the data. Subsequent multi-scale refinement is driven by a simple force-based solver designed to combine good iso-surface fit and high quality sampling through reparameterization. In contrast to the Marching Cubes technique our output meshes adapt gracefully to the iso-surface geometry, have a natural multiresolution structure and good aspect ratio triangles, as demonstrated with a number of examples.","article_number":"885705","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885705","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885705/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885705/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization 2000.

Multiresolution isosurface visualization allows the user to explore volume data using simplified and coarse representations of the isosurface for overview images, and finer resolution in areas of high interest or when zooming into the data. Ideally, a coarse isosurface should have the same topological structure as the original. The topological genus of the isosurface is one important property which is often neglected in multiresolution algorithms. This results in uncontrolled topological changes which can occur whenever the level-of-detail is changed.

However, very few algorithms have been developed for directly studying data in dimensions higher than three. Most algorithms require a sampling in three-dimensions before applying any visualization algorithms. This sampling typically ignores vital features that may be present when examined in oblique cross-sections, and places an undo burden on system resources when animation through additional dimensions is desired. For time-varying data of large data sets, smooth animation is desired at interactive rates. We provide a fast Marching Cubes like algorithm for hypercubes of any dimension. To support this, we have developed a new algorithm to automatically generate the isosurface and triangulation tables for any dimension. This allows the efficient calculation of 4D isosurfaces, which can be interactively sliced to provide smooth animation or slicing through oblique hyperplanes. The former allows for smooth animation in a very compressed format. The latter provide better tools to study time-evolving features as they move downstream. We also provide examples in using this technique to show interval volumes or the sensitivity of a particular isovalue threshold.","article_number":"885704","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885704","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885704/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885704/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization 2000.

The approach is based on a multi-resolution model for terrain texture which cooperates with a multi-resolution model for terrain geometry. For each texture layer, an image pyramid and a texture tree are constructed. Multiple texture layers can be associated with one terrain model and can be combined in different ways, e.g. by blending and masking. The rendering algorithm simultaneously traverses the multi-resolution geometry model and the multi-resolution texture model, and takes into account geometric and texture approximation errors. It uses multi-pass rendering and exploits multi-texturing to achieve real-time performance. Applications include interactive texture lenses, texture animation and topographic textures. These techniques offer an enormous potential for developing new visualization applications for presenting, exploring and manipulating spatio-temporal data.","article_number":"885699","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885699","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885699/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885699/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization 2000.

Our method is fundamentally different to conventional clustering algorithms, such as C-means, K-means, or linkage methods that are primarily designed to partition a collection of objects into subsets sharing similar attributes. These approaches usually lack an efficient level-of-detail strategy that breaks down the visual complexity of very large datasets for visualization. In contrast, our method combines grouping and visualization in a two stage process constructing a hierarchical setting. In the first stage a cluster tree is computed making use of an edge contraction operator. Exploiting the inherent hierarchical structure of this tree, a second stage visualizes the clusters by computing a hierarchy of implicit surfaces. We believe that H-BLOB is especially suited for the visualization of very large datasets and for visual decision making in information visualization. The versatility of the algorithm is demonstrated using examples from visual data mining.","article_number":"885677","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885677","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885677/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885677/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization 2000.

To fulfil these needs, we present a spreadsheet-like interface to data exploration. The interface displays a 2-dimensional window into visualization parameter space which users manipulate as they search for desired results. Through tabular organization and a clear correspondence between parameters and results, the interface eases the discovery, comparison and analysis of the underlying data. Users can utilize operators and the integrated interpreter to further explore and automate the visualization process; using a method introduced in this paper, these operations can be applied to cells in different stacks of the interface. Via illustrations using a variety of data sets, we demonstrate the efficacy of this novel interface.","article_number":"885678","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885678","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885678/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885678/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization 2000.

We provide a detailed description of the hardware implementation, including temporal and spatial coherence techniques, dye advection techniques, and feature extraction.","article_number":"885689","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885689","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885689/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885689/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization 2000.

It is based on continuous clustering. A well-known physical clustering model, the Cahn Hilliard model (J. Cahn and J. Hilliard, 1958), which describes phase separation, is modified to reflect the properties of the data to be visualized. Clusters are defined implicitly as connected components of the positivity set of a density function. An evolution equation for this function is obtained as a suitable gradient flow of an underlying anisotropic energy functional. Here, time serves as the scale parameter. The evolution is characterized by a successive coarsening of patterns: the actual clustering, and meanwhile the underlying simulation data specifies preferable pattern boundaries. The authors discuss the applicability of this new type of approach mainly for flow fields, where the cluster energy penalizes cross streamline boundaries, but the method also carries provisions in other fields as well. The clusters are visualized via iconic representations. A skeletonization algorithm is used to find suitable positions for the icons.","article_number":"885715","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885715","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885715/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885715/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization 2000.

The proposed strategy for computing catchment basins in a given region of interest is based on a rain-falling simulation. Unlike the standard watershed algorithms, which flood the complete (gradient magnitude of an) image, the proposed approach allows us to perform this task locally. Thus, a controlled region growth is performed, saving time and reducing the memory requirement especially when applied on volume data. A second problem arising from the standard watershed transformation is the over-segmented result and the lack of sound criteria for merging the computed basins. For overcoming this drawback, we present a basin-merging strategy introducing four criteria for merging adjacent basins. The threshold values applied in this strategy are derived from the user input and match rather the attributes of the selected object than of all objects in the image. In doing so, the user is not required to adjust abstract numbers, but to simply select a coarse region of interest. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is not limited to the 2D case. As we show in this work, it is suitable for volume data processing as well. Finally, we present the results of applying the proposed approach on several example images and volume data sets.","article_number":"885672","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885672","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885672/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885672/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization 2000.

Improvements to splatting, such as eliminating popping and color bleeding, occasion-based acceleration, post-rendering classification and shading, have all been recently accomplished. These improvements share a common need for efficient frame-buffer accesses. We present an optimized software splatting package, using a newly designed primitive, called FastSplat, to scan-convert footprints. Our approach does not use texture mapping hardware, but supports the whole pipeline in memory. In such an integrated pipeline, we are then able to study the optimization strategies and address image quality issues. While this research is meant for a study of the inherent trade-off of splatting, our renderer, purely in software, achieves 3- to 5-fold speedups over a top-end texture hardware implementation (for opaque data sets). We further propose a method of efficient occlusion culling using a summed area table of opacity. 3D solid texturing and bump mapping capabilities are demonstrated to show the flexibility of such an integrated rendering pipeline. A detailed numerical error analysis, in addition to the performance and storage issues, is also presented. Our approach requires low storage and uses simple operations.

An effective way to alleviate the disk I/O overhead associated with rendering a large tetrahedral mesh is to reduce the I/O bandwidth requirement through compression. Existing tetrahedral mesh compression algorithms focus only on compression efficiency and cannot be readily integrated into the mesh rendering process, and thus demand that a compressed tetrahedral mesh be decompressed before it can be rendered into a 2D image. This paper presents an integrated tetrahedral mesh compression and rendering algorithm called Gatun, which allows compressed tetrahedral meshes to be rendered incrementally as they are being decompressed, thus leading to an efficient irregular grid rendering pipeline. Both compression and rendering algorithms in Gatun exploit the same local connectivity information among adjacent tetrahedra, and thus can be tightly integrated into a unified implementation framework. Our tetrahedral compression algorithm is specifically designed to facilitate the integration with an irregular grid renderer without any compromise in compression efficiency. A unique performance advantage of Gatun is its ability to reduce the runtime memory footprint requirement by releasing memory allocated to tetrahedra as early as possible.","article_number":"885682","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885682","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885682/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885682/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization 2000.

One of the most important stages of the design cycle is the initial, or concept, stage and it is here that design variants occur in large numbers to be vetted quickly. At this initial stage the human element, the designer is crucial to the success of the product. We describe an interactive environment for concept design which recognises the needs of the designer, not only to see the product and make rapid modifications, but also to monitor the progress of their design towards some preferred solution. This leads to the notion of a design parameter space, typically high-dimensional, which must also be visualized in addition to the product itself. Using a module developed for IRIS Explorer design steering is presented as a navigation of this space in order to search for optimal designs, either manually or by local optimisation.","article_number":"885707","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885707","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885707/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885707/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization 2000.

We present a novel, straight-forward algorithm for accurately and automatically reconstructing surfaces from planar contours. Our algorithm is based on scanline rendering and separating surface extraction. By rendering the contours as distinctly colored polygons and reading back each rendered slice into a segmented volume, we reduce the complex problem of building a surface from planar contours to the much simpler problem of extracting separating surfaces from a classified volume. Our scanline surfacing algorithm robustly handles complex surface topologies such as bifurcations, embedded features and abutting surfaces.","article_number":"885706","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885706","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885706/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885706/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization 2000.

Few software tools can generate multidimensional visualizations at all, let alone incorporate artistic detail. Although, it is a great efficiency to reuse these visualizations with new data, the associated artistic detail is rarely reusable. The Relational Visualization Notation is a new technique and toolkit for specifying highly expressive graphical representations of data without traditional programming. We seek to discover the accessible power of this notation, both its graphical expressiveness and its ease of re-use. Towards this end we have used the system to reconstruct Minard's visualization of Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812. The resulting image is strikingly similar to the original, and the design is straightforward to construct. Furthermore, the design permitted by the notation can be directly reused to visualize Hitler's WWII defeat before Moscow. This experience leads us to believe that artistically expressive visualizations can be made to be reusable.","article_number":"885676","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885676","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885676/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885676/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization 2000.

Such images make optimal use of space when sampled close to their Nyquist limit. A warping function may be applied to an arbitrary image to redistribute its local frequency content, reducing its highest frequencies and increasing its lowest frequencies in order to approach this uniform frequency ideal. The warped image may then be downsampled according to its new, reduced Nyquist limit, thereby reducing its storage requirements. To reconstruct the original image, the inverse warp is applied. We present a general, top-down algorithm to automatically generate a piecewise-linear warping function with this frequency balancing property for a given input image. The image size is reduced by applying the warp and then downsampling. We store this warped, downsampled image plus a small number of polygons with texture coordinates to describe the inverse warp. The original image is later reconstructed by rendering the associated polygons with the warped image applied as a texture map, a process which is easily accelerated by current graphics hardware. As compared to previous image compression techniques, we generate a similar graceful space-quality tradeoff with the advantage of being able to \"uncompress\" images during rendering. We report results for several images with sizes ranging from 15,000 to 300,000 pixels, achieving reduction rates of 70-90% with improved quality over downsampling alone.","article_number":"885701","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885701","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885701/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885701/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization 2000.

The idea is based on view-dependent rendering on a client-server network. The server stores the large dataset and manages the selection of the various levels of detail while the inexpensive clients receive a stream of update operations that generate the appropriate level of detail in an incremental fashion. These update operations are based on changes in the clients' view-parameters. Our approach dramatically reduces the amount of memory needed by each client and the entire computing system since the dataset is stored only once on the server's local memory. In addition, it decreases the load on the network as results of the incremental update contributed by view-dependent rendering.","article_number":"885713","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885713","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885713/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885713/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization 2000.

Maps may be marked with rivers, roads or topographical information, and CAD data models may highlight the underlying mesh structure. While this additional information may be extremely useful, there is a rendering cost associated with it. Texture maps have often been used to convey this information at relatively low cost, but they suffer from blurring and pixelization at high magnification. We present a technique for simplifying surface annotations based on directed, asymmetric tolerance. By maintaining the annotations as geometry, as opposed to textures, we are able to simplify them while still maintaining the overall appearance of the model over a wide range of magnifications. Texture maps may still be used to provide low-resolution surface detail, such as color. We demonstrate a significant gain in rendering performance while retaining the original appearance of objects from many application domains.","article_number":"885700","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885700","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885700/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885700/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization 2000.

Our long-term vision is to provide a better every-day working environment, with high-fidelity scene reconstruction for life-sized 3D tele-collaboration. In particular, we want a true sense of presence with our remote collaborator and their real surroundings. The challenges related to this vision are enormous and involve many technical tradeoffs. This is true in particular for scene reconstruction. Researchers have been striving to achieve real-time approaches, and while they have made respectable progress, the limitations of conventional technologies relegate them to relatively low resolution in a restricted volume. We present a significant step toward our ultimate goal, via a slightly different path. In lieu of low-fidelity dynamic scene modeling we present an exceedingly high fidelity reconstruction of a real but static office. By assembling the best of available hardware and software technologies in static scene acquisition, modeling algorithms, rendering, tracking and stereo projective display, we are able to demonstrate a portal to a real office, occupied today by a mannequin, and in the future by a real remote collaborator. We now have both a compelling sense of just how good it could be, and a framework into which we will later incorporate dynamic scene modeling, as we continue to head toward our ultimate goal of 3D collaborative telepresence.","article_number":"885712","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=885712","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885712/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/885712/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization 2000.
