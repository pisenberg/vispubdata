We can lay out much larger structures than can be handled using traditional techniques for drawing general graphs because we assume a hierarchical nature of the data. We impose a hierarchy on the graph by using domain-specific knowledge to find an appropriate spanning tree. Links which are not part of the spanning tree do not influence the layout but can be selectively drawn by user request. The volume of hyperbolic 3-space increases exponentially, as opposed to the familiar geometric increase of euclidean 3-space. We exploit this exponential amount of room by computing the layout according to the hyperbolic metric. We optimize the cone tree layout algorithm for 3D hyperbolic space by placing children on a hemisphere around the cone mouth instead of on its perimeter. Hyperbolic navigation affords a Focus+Context view of the structure with minimal visual clutter. We have successfully laid out hierarchies of over 20,000 nodes. Our implementation accommodates navigation through graphs too large to be rendered interactively by allowing the user to explicitly prune or expand subtrees.","article_number":"636718","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=636718","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/636718/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/636718/","publication_title":"Proceedings of VIZ '97: Visualization Conference, Information Visualization Symposium and Parallel Rendering Symposium","conference_location":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","conference_dates":"21-21 Oct. 1997","publication_number":5034,"is_number":13801,"publication_year":1997,"publication_date":"21-21 Oct. 1997","start_page":"2","end_page":"10","citing_paper_count":111,"citing_patent_count":7,"download_count":803,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Tree graphs","Visualization","Navigation","Mouth","Information systems","Computer science","File systems","Web sites","Web page design","History"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-8189-6","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.1997.636793","title":"Multidimensional detective","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-8189-6","partnum":"97TB100195","rank":4,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, San Diego SuperComputing Center, Tel-Aviv University, Israel","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294162600","id":37294162600,"full_name":"A.

We discuss the general utility of a novel visualization spreadsheet framework. Just as a numerical spreadsheet enables exploration of numbers, a visualization spreadsheet enables exploration of visual forms of information. We show that the spreadsheet approach facilitates certain information visualization tasks that are more difficult using other approaches. Unlike traditional spreadsheets, which store only simple data elements and formulas in each cell, a visualization spreadsheet cell can hold an entire complex data set, selection criteria, viewing specifications, and other information needed for a full-fledged information visualization. Similarly, inter-cell operations are far more complex, stretching beyond simple arithmetic and string operations to encompass a range of domain-specific operators. We have built two prototype systems that illustrate some of these research issues. The underlying approach in our work allows domain experts to define new data types and data operations, and enables visualization experts to incorporate new visualizations, viewing parameters, and view operations.","article_number":"636761","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=636761","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/636761/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/636761/","publication_title":"Proceedings of VIZ '97: Visualization Conference, Information Visualization Symposium and Parallel Rendering Symposium","conference_location":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","conference_dates":"21-21 Oct. 1997","publication_number":5034,"is_number":13801,"publication_year":1997,"publication_date":"21-21 Oct. 1997","start_page":"17","end_page":"24","citing_paper_count":31,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":533,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Software maintenance","Programming environments","Computer science","Tires","Arithmetic","Prototypes","Displays","Multidimensional systems","Navigation"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-8189-6","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.1997.636786","title":"Nonlinear magnification fields","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-8189-6","partnum":"97TB100195","rank":6,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Indiana University Bloomington, Bloomington, IN, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349418300","id":37349418300,"full_name":"T.A.

The opacity of each voxel is a function of the number of data points in a corresponding bin.

These glyphs address four important needs in project management: viewing time dependent data; managing large data volumes; dealing with diverse data types; and correspondence of data to real-world concepts.","article_number":"636782","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=636782","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/636782/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/636782/","publication_title":"Proceedings of VIZ '97: Visualization Conference, Information Visualization Symposium and Parallel Rendering Symposium","conference_location":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","conference_dates":"21-21 Oct. 1997","publication_number":5034,"is_number":13801,"publication_year":1997,"publication_date":"21-21 Oct. 1997","start_page":"30","end_page":"37","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":78,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Project management","Data visualization","Engineering management","Human resource management","Computer science","Resource management","Processor scheduling","Statistics","Software engineering","Production"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-8189-6","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.1997.636778","title":"Adaptive information visualization based on the user's multiple viewpoints-interactive 3D visualization of the WWW","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-8189-6","partnum":"97TB100195","rank":12,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Advanced Technology R&D Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Amagasaki, Japan","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37361571100","id":37361571100,"full_name":"T.

According to the given viewpoint, the RF-Cone adaptively organizes the 3D representation of the hypermedia so that we can understand the semantic and structural relationship of the hypermedia and easily retrieve the information. Combining these methods, we have developed the WWW visualization system which can provide highly efficient navigation.","article_number":"636778","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=636778","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/636778/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/636778/","publication_title":"Proceedings of VIZ '97: Visualization Conference, Information Visualization Symposium and Parallel Rendering Symposium","conference_location":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","conference_dates":"21-21 Oct. 1997","publication_number":5034,"is_number":13801,"publication_year":1997,"publication_date":"21-21 Oct. 1997","start_page":"25","end_page":"28","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":8,"download_count":158,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","World Wide Web","Navigation","Information retrieval","Computer graphics","Character generation","Research and development","Hardware","Workstations","Personal communication networks"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-8189-6","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.1997.636784","title":"On integrating visualization techniques for effective software exploration","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-8189-6","partnum":"97TB100195","rank":13,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268043300","id":37268043300,"full_name":"M.-A.D.

The technique integrates both pan+zoom and fisheye-view visualization approaches for exploring a nested graph view of software structure. The fisheye-view approach handles multiple focal points, which are necessary when examining several subsystems and their mutual interconnections. Source code is presented by embedding code fragments within the nodes of the nested graph. Finer connections among these fragments are represented by a network that is navigated using a hypertext link-following metaphor. SHriMP combines this hypertext metaphor with animated panning and zooming motions over the nested graph to provide continuous orientation and contextual cues for the user. The SHriMP tool is being evaluated in several user studies. Observations of users performing program understanding tasks with the tool are discussed.","article_number":"636784","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=636784","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/636784/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/636784/","publication_title":"Proceedings of VIZ '97: Visualization Conference, Information Visualization Symposium and Parallel Rendering Symposium","conference_location":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","conference_dates":"21-21 Oct. 1997","publication_number":5034,"is_number":13801,"publication_year":1997,"publication_date":"21-21 Oct. 1997","start_page":"38","end_page":"45","citing_paper_count":30,"citing_patent_count":2,"download_count":329,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Switches","Programming profession","Navigation","Data visualization","Animation","Software systems","Software maintenance","Software tools","Documentation","Data structures"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-8189-6","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.1997.636759","title":"Visualizing information on a sphere","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-8189-6","partnum":"97TB100195","rank":14,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Federal Institute of Technology (ETH), Zurich, Switzerland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275694700","id":37275694700,"full_name":"M.H.

The system is based on a quantification of the similarity of related objects that governs the parameters of a mass-spring system. Unlike existing approaches we initialize all information units onto the inner surface of two concentric spheres and attach them with springs to the outer sphere. Since the spring stiffnesses correspond to the computed similarity measures, the system converges into an energy minimum which reveals multidimensional relations and adjacencies in terms of spatial neighborhoods. Depending on the application scenario our approach supports different topological arrangements of related objects. In order to cope with large data sets we propose a blobby clustering mechanism that enables encapsulation of similar objects by implicit shapes. In addition, we implemented various interaction techniques allowing semantic analysis of the underlying data sets. Our prototype system IVORY is written in Java, and its versatility is illustrated by an example from financial service providers.","article_number":"636759","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=636759","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/636759/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/636759/","publication_title":"Proceedings of VIZ '97: Visualization Conference, Information Visualization Symposium and Parallel Rendering Symposium","conference_location":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","conference_dates":"21-21 Oct. 1997","publication_number":5034,"is_number":13801,"publication_year":1997,"publication_date":"21-21 Oct. 1997","start_page":"11","end_page":"16","citing_paper_count":18,"citing_patent_count":3,"download_count":207,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Multidimensional systems","Computer science","World Wide Web","Fingers","Banking","Computer industry","Risk analysis","Energy measurement","Encapsulation"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-8189-6","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.1997.636789","title":"Domesticating Bead: adapting an information visualization system to a financial institution","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-8189-6","partnum":"97TB100195","rank":15,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"UbiLaboratory, Union Bank of Switzerland, Zurich, Switzerland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37611663700","id":37611663700,"full_name":"D.

The variety of data analyzed in a financial institution such as UBS, and the ubiquity of spreadsheets as a medium for analysis, led us to extend our layout tools to handle data in a generic spreadsheet format. We describe the metrics of similarity used for this data type, and give examples of layouts of sets of records of financial trades. Conservatism and scepticism with regard to 3D visualization, along with the lack of functionality of widely available 3D web browsers, led to the development of a 2D visualization tool with refinements of a number of our imageability features.","article_number":"636789","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=636789","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/636789/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/636789/","publication_title":"Proceedings of VIZ '97: Visualization Conference, Information Visualization Symposium and Parallel Rendering Symposium","conference_location":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","conference_dates":"21-21 Oct. 1997","publication_number":5034,"is_number":13801,"publication_year":1997,"publication_date":"21-21 Oct. 1997","start_page":"73","end_page":"80","citing_paper_count":18,"citing_patent_count":2,"download_count":195,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Collaboration","Data analysis","Multidimensional systems","Scattering","Guidelines","Financial management","Marketing management","Databases","Stochastic processes"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-8189-6","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.1997.636788","title":"Coordinating declarative queries with a direct manipulation data exploration environment","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-8189-6","partnum":"97TB100195","rank":16,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37444609500","id":37444609500,"full_name":"M.

However limitations in expressive power of current visualization systems force users to go outside the system and form a new dataset in order to perform certain operations, such as those involving the relationship among multiple objects. Further, there is no support for integrating data from the new dataset into previous visualizations, so users must recreate them. Visage's information centric paradigm provides an architectural hook for linking data across multiple queries, removing this overhead. This paper describes the addition to Visage of a visual query language, called VQE, which allows users to express more complicated queries than in previous interactive visualization systems. Visualizations can be created from queries and vice versa. When either is updated, the other changes to maintain consistency.","article_number":"636788","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=636788","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/636788/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/636788/","publication_title":"Proceedings of VIZ '97: Visualization Conference, Information Visualization Symposium and Parallel Rendering Symposium","conference_location":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","conference_dates":"21-21 Oct. 1997","publication_number":5034,"is_number":13801,"publication_year":1997,"publication_date":"21-21 Oct. 1997","start_page":"65","end_page":"72","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":77,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Database systems","Visual databases","Joining processes","Database languages","Data analysis","Object oriented modeling","Robot kinematics","Feedback","User interfaces"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-8189-6","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.1997.636796","title":"Index of authors","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-8189-6","partnum":"97TB100195","rank":17,"authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Presents an index of the authors whose papers are published in the conference.","article_number":"636796","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=636796","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/636796/","publication_title":"Proceedings of VIZ '97: Visualization Conference, Information Visualization Symposium and Parallel Rendering Symposium","conference_location":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","conference_dates":"21-21 Oct. 1997","publication_number":5034,"is_number":13801,"publication_year":1997,"publication_date":"21-21 Oct. 1997","start_page":"127","end_page":"127","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":30,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-8189-6","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.1997.636699","title":"Proceedings of VIZ '97: Visualization Conference, Information Visualization Symposium and Parallel Rendering Symposium","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-8189-6","partnum":"97TB100195","rank":18,"authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Conferences","article_number":"636699","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=636699","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/636699/","publication_title":"Proceedings of VIZ '97: Visualization Conference, Information Visualization Symposium and Parallel Rendering Symposium","conference_location":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","conference_dates":"21-21 Oct. 1997","publication_number":5034,"is_number":13801,"publication_year":1997,"publication_date":"21-21 Oct. 1997","start_page":"iii","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":185,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-8189-6","isbnType":"Historical"}]}}]}
