A fourth-order Runge-Kutta integrator with adaptive step size and error control is employed for rapid accurate streamline advection. Cubic Hermite polynomial interpolation with large sample-spacing is adopted to create fewer evenly-spaced samples along each streamline to reduce the amount of distance checking. We propose two methods to enhance placement quality. Double queues are used to prioritizetopological seeding and to favor long streamlines to minimize discontinuities. Adaptive distance control based on the local flow variance is explored to reduce cavities. Furthermore, we propose a universal, effective, fast, and robust loop detection strategy to address closed and spiraling streamlines.

Most of the previous work on automatic polyp detection makes use of indicators based on the scalar curvature of the colon wall and can result in many false-positive detections. Our work tries to reduce the number of false-positive detections in the preselection of polyp candidates. Polyp surface shape can be characterized and visualized using lines of curvature. In this paper, we describe techniques for generating and rendering lines of curvature on surfaces and we show that these lines can be used as part of a polyp detection approach. We have adapted existing approaches on explicit triangular surface meshes, and developed a new algorithm on implicit surfaces embedded in 3D volume data. The visualization of shaded colonic surfaces can be enhanced by rendering the derived lines of curvature on these surfaces. Features strongly correlated with true-positive detections were calculated on lines of curvature and used for the polyp candidate selection. We studied the performance of these features on 5 data sets that included 331 pre-detected candidates, of which 50 sites were true polyps. The winding angle had a significant discriminating power for true-positive detections, which was demonstrated by a Wilcoxon rank sum test with p<0.001. The median winding angle and inter-quartile range (IQR) for true polyps were 7.817 and 6.770-9.288 compared to 2.954 and 1.995-3.749 for false-positive detections.","article_number":"4015443","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4015443","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4015443/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4015443/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4015412,"publication_year":2006,"publication_date":"Sept.-Oct. 2006","start_page":"885","end_page":"892","citing_paper_count":36,"citing_patent_count":2,"download_count":472,"insert_date":"20061120","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Colonic polyps","Virtual colonoscopy","Colon","Data visualization","Colonography","Shape","Cancer","Biomedical imaging","Medical diagnostic imaging","Computer aided diagnosis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Medical visualization","virtual colonoscopy","polyp detection","line of curvature","implicit surface."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2006.182","title":"Techniques for the Visualization of Topological Defect Behavior in Nematic Liquid Crystals","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"5","issn":"2160-9306","rank":5,"volume":"12","authors":{"authors":[{"authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38185192000","id":38185192000,"full_name":"Vadim Slavin","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":null}},{"authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087703242","id":37087703242,"full_name":"Robert Pelcovits","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":null}},{"authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38275048800","id":38275048800,"full_name":"George Loriot","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":null}},{"authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38277115900","id":38277115900,"full_name":"Andrew Callan-Jones","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":null}},{"authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275712600","id":37275712600,"full_name":"David Laidlaw","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":null}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present visualization tools for analyzing molecular simulations of liquid crystal (LC) behavior.

We assume that the hierarchy is shown via a standard tree visualization method. Next, we bend each adjacency edge, modeled as a B-spline curve, toward the polyline defined by the path via the inclusion edges from one node to another. This hierarchical bundling reduces visual clutter and also visualizes implicit adjacency edges between parent nodes that are the result of explicit adjacency edges between their respective child nodes. Furthermore, hierarchical edge bundling is a generic method which can be used in conjunction with existing tree visualization techniques.

As data sets are constantly growing in size, this increasingly leads to I/O bottlenecks. When the rate at which data is produced exceeds the available I/O bandwidth, the simulation stalls and the CPUs are idle. Data compression can alleviate this problem by using some CPU cycles to reduce the amount of data needed to be transfered. Most compression schemes, however, are designed to operate offline and seek to maximize compression, not throughput. Furthermore, they often require quantizing floating-point values onto a uniform integer grid, which disqualifies their use in applications where exact values must be retained. We propose a simple scheme for lossless, online compression of floating-point data that transparently integrates into the I/O of many applications. A plug-in scheme for data-dependent prediction makes our scheme applicable to a wide variety of data used in visualization, such as unstructured meshes, point sets, images, and voxel grids. We achieve state-of-the-art compression rates and speeds, the latter in part due to an improved entropy coder. We demonstrate that this significantly accelerates I/O throughput in real simulation runs.

MatrixExplorer provides several novel features to support the exploration of social networks with a matrix-based representation, in addition to the standard interactive filtering and clustering functions. It provides tools to reorder (layout) matrices, to annotate and compare findings across different layouts and find consensus among several clusterings.

The role of context visualization is to provide an overview of the data for improved user orientation and improved navigation. A good overview comprises the representation of both outliers and trends. Up to now, however, context visualization not really treated outliers sufficiently. In this paper we present a new approach to focus+context visualization in parallel coordinates which is truthful to outliers in the sense that small-scale features are detected before visualization and then treated specially during context visualization. Generally, we present a solution which enables context visualization at several levels of abstraction, both for the representation of outliers and trends. We introduce outlier detection and context generation to parallel coordinates on the basis of a binned data representation. This leads to an output-oriented visualization approach which means that only those parts of the visualization process are executed which actually affect the final rendering. Accordingly, the performance of this solution is much more dependent on the visualization size than on the data size which makes it especially interesting for large datasets. Previous approaches are outperformed, the new solution was successfully applied to datasets with up to 3 million data records and up to 50 dimensions.","article_number":"4015444","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4015444","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4015444/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4015444/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4015412,"publication_year":2006,"publication_date":"Sept.-Oct. 2006","start_page":"893","end_page":"900","citing_paper_count":132,"citing_patent_count":3,"download_count":1592,"insert_date":"20061120","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Humans","Navigation","Computer vision","Visual system","Information processing","Concurrent computing","Jamming","Multidimensional systems","Costs"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Parallel coordinates","focus+context visualization","outliers & trends","large data visualization."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2006.152","title":"Importance-Driven Focus of Attention","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"5","issn":"2160-9306","rank":13,"volume":"12","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, University of Technology, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282726800","id":37282726800,"full_name":"Ivan Viola","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Informatics and Applications, University of Girona, Spain","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37426689600","id":37426689600,"full_name":"Miquel Feixas","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Informatics and Applications, University of Girona, Spain"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Informatics and Applications, University of Girona, Spain","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396572900","id":37396572900,"full_name":"Mateu Sbert","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Informatics and Applications, University of Girona, Spain"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, University of Technology, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282552200","id":37282552200,"full_name":"Meister Eduard Groller","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"This paper introduces a concept for automatic focusing on features within a volumetric data set.

However, interactive exploration of networks is currently challenging because: (1) it is difficult to find patterns and comprehend the structure of networks with many nodes and links, and (2) current systems are often a medley of statistical methods and overwhelming visual output which leaves many analysts uncertain about how to explore in an orderly manner. This results in exploration that is largely opportunistic. Our contributions are techniques to help structural analysts understand social networks more effectively. We present SocialAction, a system that uses attribute ranking and coordinated views to help users systematically examine numerous SNA measures. Users can (1) flexibly iterate through visualizations of measures to gain an overview, filter nodes, and find outliers, (2) aggregate networks using link structure, find cohesive subgroups, and focus on communities of interest, and (3) untangle networks by viewing different link types separately, or find patterns across different link types using a matrix overview. For each operation, a stable node layout is maintained in the network visualization so users can make comparisons.

We present a new approach to analyze Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities in which we extract a hierarchical segmentation of the mixing envelope surface to identify bubbles and analyze analogous segmentations of fields on the original interface plane. We compute meaningful statistical information that reveals the evolution of topological features and corroborates the observations made by scientists. We also use geometric tracking to follow the evolution of single bubbles and highlight merge/split events leading to the formation of the large and complex structures characteristic of the later stages. In particular we (i) Provide a formal definition of a bubble; (ii) Segment the envelope surface to identify bubbles; (iii) Provide a multi-scale analysis technique to produce statistical measures of bubble growth; (iv) Correlate bubble measurements with analysis of fields on the interface plane; (v) Track the evolution of individual bubbles over time.

These segments are displaced to reveal otherwise hidden detail. In this paper we apply the concept of exploded views to volumetric data in order to solve the general problem of occlusion. In many cases an object of interest is occluded by other structures. While transparency or cutaways can be used to reveal a focus object, these techniques remove parts of the context information. Exploded views, on the other hand, do not suffer from this drawback. Our approach employs a force-based model: the volume is divided into a part configuration controlled by a number of forces and constraints.

This consists of two interrelated issues. The first is to avoid label popping and other artifacts that cause confusion and interrupt navigation, and the second is to label at interactive speed. In most formulations the static map labeling problem is $NP$-hard, and a fast approximation might have $O(n \\log n)$ complexity. Even this is too slow during interaction, when the number of labels shown can be several orders of magnitude less than the number in the map. In this paper we introduce a set of desiderata for ``consistent'' dynamic map labeling, which has qualities desirable for navigation. We develop a new framework for dynamic labeling that achieves the desiderata and allows for fast interactive display by moving all of the selection and placement decisions into the preprocessing phase. This framework is general enough to accommodate a variety of selection and placement algorithms. It does not appear possible to achieve our desiderata using previous frameworks. Prior to this paper, there were no formal models of dynamic maps or of dynamic labels; our paper introduces both. We formulate a general optimization problem for dynamic map labeling and give a solution to a simple version of the problem. The simple version is based on label priorities and a versatile and intuitive class of dynamic label placements we call ``invariant point placements''. Despite these restrictions, our approach gives a useful and practical solution. Our implementation is incorporated into the G-Vis system which is a full-detail dynamic map of the continental USA.

However, they often produce extremely tangled results and exhibit impractical running times for highly non-planar graphs with large edge density. And very few graph layout algorithms support dynamic time-varying graphs; applying them independently to each frame produces distracting temporally incoherent visualizations. We have developed a new visualization technique based on a novel approach to hierarchically structuring dense graphs via stratification. Using this structure, we formulate a hierarchical force-directed layout algorithm that is both efficient and produces quality graph layouts. The stratification of the graph also allows us to present views of the data that abstract away many small details of its structure. Rather than displaying all edges and nodes at once, resulting in a convoluted rendering, we present an interactive tool that filters edges and nodes using the graph hierarchy and allows users to drill down into the graph for details. Our layout algorithm also accommodates time-varying graphs in a natural way, producing a temporally coherent animation that can be used to analyze and extract trends from dynamic graph data. For example, we demonstrate the use of our method to explore financial correlation data for the U.S. stock market in the period from 1990 to 2005. The user can easily analyze the time-varying correlation graph of the market, uncovering information such as market sector trends, representative stocks for portfolio construction, and the interrelationship of stocks over time.","article_number":"4015433","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4015433","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4015433/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4015433/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4015412,"publication_year":2006,"publication_date":"Sept.-Oct. 2006","start_page":"805","end_page":"812","citing_paper_count":61,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1134,"insert_date":"20061120","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Animation","Data mining","Tree graphs","Layout","Heuristic algorithms","Filters","Algorithm design and analysis","Stock markets","Information analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Graph and network visualization","financial data visualization","hierarchy visualization","time series data"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2006.172","title":"Real-Time Illustration of Vascular Structures","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"5","issn":"2160-9306","rank":30,"volume":"12","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"MeVis GmbH, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37645939800","id":37645939800,"full_name":"Felix Ritter","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["MeVis GmbH, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"MeVis GmbH, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086319901","id":37086319901,"full_name":"Christian Hansen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["MeVis GmbH, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"MeVis GmbH, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37828698600","id":37828698600,"full_name":"Volker Dicken","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["MeVis GmbH, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"MeVis GmbH, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37828698700","id":37828698700,"full_name":"Olaf Konrad","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["MeVis GmbH, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37424645300","id":37424645300,"full_name":"Bernhard Preim","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Magdeburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"MeVis GmbH, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37442956900","id":37442956900,"full_name":"Heinz-otto Peitgen","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["MeVis GmbH, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present real-time vascular visualization methods, which extend on illustrative rendering techniques to particularly accentuate spatial depth and to improve the perceptive separation of important vascular properties such as branching level and supply area.

But just how much can scalability increase using larger displays before hitting human perceptual or cognitive limits? Are the same visualization techniques that are good on a single monitor also the techniques that are best when they are scaled up using large, high-resolution displays? To answer these questions we performed a controlled experiment on user performance time, accuracy, and subjective workload when scaling up data quantity with different space-time-attribute visualizations using a large, tiled display. Twelve college students used small multiples, embedded bar matrices, and embedded time-series graphs either on a 2 megapixel (Mp) display or with data scaled up using a 32 Mp tiled display. Participants performed various overview and detail tasks on geospatially-referenced multidimensional time-series data. Results showed that current designs are perceptually scalable because they result in a decrease in task completion time when normalized per number of data attributes along with no decrease in accuracy. It appears that, for the visualizations selected for this study, the relative comparison between designs is generally consistent between display sizes. However, results also suggest that encoding is more important on a smaller display while spatial grouping is more important on a larger display. Some suggestions for designers are provided based on our experience designing visualizations for large displays.","article_number":"4015437","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4015437","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4015437/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4015437/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4015412,"publication_year":2006,"publication_date":"Sept.-Oct. 2006","start_page":"837","end_page":"844","citing_paper_count":58,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":1304,"insert_date":"20061120","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Scalability","Data visualization","Large screen displays","Humans","Biological information theory","Multidimensional systems","Computer displays","Monitoring","Educational institutions","Encoding"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Information visualization","large displays","empirical evaluation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2006.142","title":"FacetMap: A Scalable Search and Browse Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"5","issn":"2160-9306","rank":33,"volume":"12","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37960251500","id":37960251500,"full_name":"Greg Smith","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37563799500","id":37563799500,"full_name":"Mary Czerwinski","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37449089000","id":37449089000,"full_name":"Brian Meyers","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38245686000","id":38245686000,"full_name":"Daniel Robbins","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37448060300","id":37448060300,"full_name":"George Robertson","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37955052000","id":37955052000,"full_name":"Desney S.

A key issue of generating a good animation is to select ideal views through which the user can perceive the maximum amount of information from the time-varying dataset. In this paper, we first propose an improved view selection method for static data. The method measures the quality of a static view by analyzing the opacity, color and curvature distributions of the corresponding volume rendering images from the given view. Our view selection metric prefers an even opacity distribution with a larger projection area, a larger area of salient features' colors with an even distribution among the salient features, and more perceived curvatures. We use this static view selection method and a dynamic programming approach to select time-varying views. The time-varying view selection maximizes the information perceived from the time-varying dataset based on the constraints that the time-varying view should show smooth changes of direction and near-constant speed. We also introduce a method that allows the user to generate a smooth transition between any two views in a given time step, with the perceived information maximized as well.

They are often the main computational component of important processing pipelines (e.g., surface reconstruction), and are heavily used in practice. The classical approach to compute isosurfaces is to apply the Marching Cubes algorithm, which although robust and simple to implement, generates surfaces that require additional processing steps to improve triangle quality and mesh size. An important issue is that in some cases, the surfaces generated by Marching Cubes are irreparably damaged, and important details are lost which can not be recovered by subsequent processing. The main motivation of this work is to develop a technique capable of constructing high-quality and high-fidelity isosurfaces. We propose a new advancing front technique that is capable of creating high-quality isosurfaces from regular and irregular volumetric datasets. Our work extends the guidance field framework of Schreiner et al. to implicit surfaces, and improves it in significant ways. In particular, we describe a set of sampling conditions that guarantee that surface features will be captured by the algorithm.

We present a single-program-multiple-data (SPMD) calibration algorithm that runs on each PPP and achieves a truly scalable and reconfigurable display without any input from the user. It instruments novel capabilities like adding/removing PPPs from the display dynamically, detecting faults, and reshaping the display to a reasonable rectangular shape to react to the addition/removal/faults.

The final detection results are stored in the 2D image, which can be easily incorporated into a virtual colonoscopy (VC) system to highlight the polyp locations. The extracted colon surface mesh can be used to accelerate the volumetric ray casting algorithm used to generate the VC endoscopic view.

In this work, we introduce a concise yet complete interpolation scheme of vector fields on arbitrary triangulated surfaces. The scheme enables arbitrary singularities to be represented at vertices} The representation can be considered as a facet-based \"encoding\" of vector fields on piecewise linear surfaces. The vector field is described in polar coordinates over each facet, with a facet edge being chosen as the reference to define the angle. An integer called the period jump is associated to each edge of the triangulation to remove the ambiguity when interpolating the direction of the vector field between two facets that share an edge. To interpolate the vector field, we first linearly interpolate the angle of rotation of the vectors along the edges of the facet graph. Then, we use a variant of Nielson's side-vertex scheme to interpolate the vector field over the entire surface. With our representation, we remove the bound imposed on the complexity of singularities that a vertex can represent by its connectivity. This bound is a limitation generally exists in vertex-based linear schemes. Furthermore, using our data structure, the index of a vertex of a vector field can be combinatorily determined. We show the simplicity of the interpolation scheme with a GPU-accelerated algorithm for a LIC-based visualization of the so-defined vector fields, operating in image space. We demonstrate the algorithm applied to various vector fields on curved surfaces.","article_number":"4015497","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4015497","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4015497/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4015497/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4015412,"publication_year":2006,"publication_date":"Sept.-Oct. 2006","start_page":"1315","end_page":"1322","citing_paper_count":38,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":578,"insert_date":"20061120","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Vectors","Piecewise linear techniques","Topology","Interpolation","Data structures","Computational fluid dynamics","Data visualization","Integral equations","Convolution","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["vector field visualization","higher-order singularities","line integral convolution","GPU"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2006.187","title":"User Interaction with Scatterplots on Small Screens - A Comparative Evaluation of Geometric-Semantic Zoom and Fisheye Distortion","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"5","issn":"2160-9306","rank":43,"volume":"12","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087962939","id":37087962939,"full_name":"Thorsten Buering","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Inc., Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086433456","id":37086433456,"full_name":"Jens Gerken","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Inc., Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37326200300","id":37326200300,"full_name":"Harald Reiterer","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Existing information-visualization techniques that target small screens are usually limited to exploring a few hundred items.

In addition, other dependent variables such as user satisfaction and subjective rating of orientation and navigation support revealed a preference for the fisheye distortion.

For their reconstruction, streamline techniques commonly referred to as fiber tracking model the underlying fiber structures and have therefore gained interest. To meet the requirements of surgical planning and to overcome the visual limitations of line representations, a new real-time visualization approach of high visual quality is introduced. For this purpose, textured triangle strips and point sprites are combined in a hybrid strategy employing GPU programming. The triangle strips follow the fiber streamlines and are textured to obtain a tube-like appearance. A vertex program is used to orient the triangle strips towards the camera. In order to avoid triangle flipping in case of fiber segments where the viewing and segment direction are parallel, a correct visual representation is achieved in these areas by chains of point sprites. As a result, high quality visualization similar to tubes is provided allowing for interactive multimodal inspection.

A LOD map is generated through the mapping of key LOD ingredients to a treemap representation. The ordered treemap layout is used for relative stable update of the LOD map when the view or LOD changes. This visual interface not only indicates the quality of LODs in an intuitive way, but also provides immediate suggestions for possible LOD improvement through visually-striking features.

This is achieved by animating a nonperspective image where geographical landmarks such as mountain tops and roads are rendered as if they are seen from different viewpoints. The technical contribution of this paper lies in formulating the nonperspective terrain navigation as an inverse problem of continuously deforming a 3D terrain surface from the 2D screen arrangement of its associated geographical landmarks. The present approach provides a perceptually reasonable compromise between the navigation clarity and visual realism where the corresponding nonperspective view is fully augmented by assigning appropriate textures and shading effects to the terrain surface according to its geometry. An eye tracking experiment is conducted to prove that the present approach actually exhibits visually-pleasing navigation frames while users can clearly recognize the shape of the driving route without occlusion, together with the spatial configuration of geographical landmarks in its neighborhood","article_number":"4015475","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4015475","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4015475/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4015475/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4015412,"publication_year":2006,"publication_date":"Sept.-Oct. 2006","start_page":"1141","end_page":"1148","citing_paper_count":25,"citing_patent_count":3,"download_count":391,"insert_date":"20061120","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Animation","Navigation","Roads","Layout","Rendering (computer graphics)","Inverse problems","Surface texture","Geometry","Shape","Visual perception"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["car navigation systems","nonperspective projection","occlusion-free animation","visual perception","temporal coherence"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2006.201","title":"Vortex Visualization for Practical Engineering Applications","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"5","issn":"2160-9306","rank":57,"volume":"12","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Graduate Research Assistant at the Computational Simulation and Design Center, Mississippi State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38274230400","id":38274230400,"full_name":"Monika Jankun-Kelly","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Graduate Research Assistant at the Computational Simulation and Design Center, Mississippi State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Postdoctoral Researcher at the Center for Applied Scientific Computing, Lawrence Livemore National Laboratory, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37826582200","id":37826582200,"full_name":"Ming Jiang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Postdoctoral Researcher at the Center for Applied Scientific Computing, Lawrence Livemore National Laboratory, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of AeroSpace Engineering, Mississippi State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089131714","id":37089131714,"full_name":"David Thompson","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of AeroSpace Engineering, Mississippi State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37269516700","id":37269516700,"full_name":"Raghu Machiraju","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In order to understand complex vortical flows in large data sets, we must be able to detect and visualize vortices in an automated fashion.

At the core of our method is the idea to perform the sampling of tetrahedral elements along the view rays entirely in local barycentric coordinates. Then, sampling requires minimum GPU memory and texture access operations, and it maps efficiently onto a feed-forward pipeline of multiple stages performing computation and geometry construction. We propose to spawn rendered elements from one single vertex. This makes the method amenable to upcoming Direct3D 10 graphics hardware which allows to create geometry on the GPU. By only modifying the algorithm slightly it can be used to render per-pixel iso-surfaces and to perform tetrahedral cell projection. As our method neither requires any pre-processing nor an intermediate grid representation it can efficiently deal with dynamic and large 3D meshes.","article_number":"4015501","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4015501","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4015501/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4015501/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4015412,"publication_year":2006,"publication_date":"Sept.-Oct. 2006","start_page":"1345","end_page":"1352","citing_paper_count":22,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":376,"insert_date":"20061120","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Pipelines","Rendering (computer graphics)","Hardware","Personal communication networks","Sampling methods","Computational geometry","Computer graphics","Visualization","Feedforward systems","Plastics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Direct volume rendering","unstructured grids","programmable graphics hardware"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2006.176","title":"Scalable WIM: Effective Exploration in Large-scale Astrophysical Environments","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"5","issn":"2160-9306","rank":59,"volume":"12","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Indiana University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37835045200","id":37835045200,"full_name":"Yinggang Li","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Indiana University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37336329800","id":37336329800,"full_name":"Chi-wing Fu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Indiana University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37333439100","id":37333439100,"full_name":"Andrew Hanson","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Indiana University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Navigating through large-scale virtual environments such as simulations of the astrophysical Universe is difficult.

To facilitate user interaction, a critical system requirement for collaborative visualization is to ensure that remote users would perceive a synchronized view of the shared data. Failing this requirement, the user's ability in performing the desirable collaborative tasks would be affected. In this paper, we propose a synchronization method to support collaborative visualization. It considers how interaction with dynamic objects is perceived by application participants under the existence of network latency, and remedies the motion trajectory of the dynamic objects.

Discovering interesting patterns through visualization is an important way of gaining insight about such data. A previously proposed approach is to apply local placement functions such as PixelMaps that transform the input data set into a solution set that preserves certain constraints while making interesting patterns more obvious and avoid data loss from overplotting. In experience, this family of spatial transformations can reveal fine structures in large point sets, but it is sometimes difficult to relate those structures to basic geographic features such as cities and regional boundaries. Recent information visualization research has addressed other types of transformation functions that make spatially-transformed maps with recognizable shapes. These types of spatial-transformation are called global shape functions. In particular, cartogram-based map distortion has been studied.

In this study, we present a framework that allows the user to specify a global shape function and a local placement function.

The thread-like structures of neurons and micro-vessels pose a unique problem in visualization since they tend to be densely packed in small volumes of tissue. This makes it difficult for an observer to interpret useful patterns from the data or trace individual fibers. In this paper we describe several methods for dealing with large amounts of thread-like data, such as data sets collected using Knife-Edge Scanning Microscopy (KESM) and Serial Block-Face Scanning Electron Microscopy (SBF-SEM). These methods allow us to collect volumetric data from embedded samples of whole-brain tissue. The neuronal and microvascular data that we acquire consists of thin, branching structures extending over very large regions. Traditional visualization schemes are not sufficient to make sense of the large, dense, complex structures encountered. In this paper, we address three methods to allow a user to explore a fiber network effectively. We describe interactive techniques for rendering large sets of neurons using self-orienting surfaces implemented on the GPU. We also present techniques for rendering fiber networks in a way that provides useful information about flow and orientation. Third, a global illumination framework is used to create high-quality visualizations that emphasize the underlying fiber structure. Implementation details, performance, and advantages and disadvantages of each approach are discussed.","article_number":"4015478","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4015478","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4015478/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4015478/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4015412,"publication_year":2006,"publication_date":"Sept.-Oct. 2006","start_page":"1165","end_page":"1172","citing_paper_count":17,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":403,"insert_date":"20061120","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Scanning electron microscopy","Computer science","Neurons","Lighting","Data acquisition","Image segmentation","Rendering (computer graphics)","Hardware"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["neuron visualization","GPU acceleration","global illumination","orientation filtering"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2006.171","title":"Progressive Volume Rendering of Large Unstructured Grids","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"5","issn":"2160-9306","rank":67,"volume":"12","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37426872800","id":37426872800,"full_name":"Steven P.

Geometric approaches of this kind are more efcient than FEM in the high and medium frequency range. For low frequencies they fail to represent diffraction, which on the other hand can be simulated properly by means of FEM. When combining both methods we need to calibrate them properly and estimate in which frequency range they provide comparable results. For this purpose we use an acoustic metric called gain and display the resulting error. Furthermore we visualize interference patterns, since these depend not only on diffraction, but also exhibit phase-dependent amplication and neutralization effects.","article_number":"4015479","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4015479","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4015479/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4015479/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4015412,"publication_year":2006,"publication_date":"Sept.-Oct. 2006","start_page":"1173","end_page":"1180","citing_paper_count":17,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":405,"insert_date":"20061120","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Acoustic waves","Solid modeling","Acoustic diffraction","Frequency estimation","Partial differential equations","Finite element methods","Phonons","Displays","Interference"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["acoustic simulation","comparative visualization","ray tracing","nite element method","phonon map"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2006.175","title":"Scalable Data Servers for Large Multivariate Volume Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"5","issn":"2160-9306","rank":69,"volume":"12","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Tennessee, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37828700000","id":37828700000,"full_name":"Markus Glatter","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Tennessee, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Tennessee, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37281262900","id":37281262900,"full_name":"Jian Huang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Tennessee, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Tennessee, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38560105700","id":38560105700,"full_name":"Jinzhu Gao","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Tennessee, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087648293","id":37087648293,"full_name":"Colin Mollenhour","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Volumetric datasets with multiple variables on each voxel over multiple time steps are often complex, especially when considering the exponentially large attribute space formed by the variables in combination with the spatial and temporal dimensions.

This approach is straightforward to implement if the dataset is small enough to be stored entirely in-core. However, to handle datasets sized at hundreds of gigabytes and beyond, this simplistic approach becomes infeasible and thus, more sophisticated solutions are needed. In this work, we developed a system that supports efficient visualization of an arbitrary subset, selected by range-queries, of a large multivariate time-varying dataset. By employing specialized data structures and schemes of data distribution, our system can leverage a large number of networked computers as parallel data servers, and guarantees a near optimal load-balance.

We focus on the visualization of so-called folding landscapes of a growing RNA molecule. Folding landscapes describe the energy of a molecule as a function of its spatial configuration; thus they are huge and high dimensional. Their most salient features, however, are encapsulated by their so-called barrier tree that reflects the local minima and their connecting saddle points. For each length of the growing RNA chain there exists a folding landscape. We visualize the sequence of folding landscapes by an animation of the corresponding barrier trees. To generate the animation, we adapt the foresight layout with tolerance algorithm for general dynamic graph layout problems.

Unfortunately, traditional atmospheric visualization systems only provide tools to view a limited number of variables and small segments of the data. These tools are often restricted to 2D contour or vector plots or 3D isosurfaces. The meteorologist must mentally synthesize the data from multiple plots to glean the information needed to produce a coherent picture of the weather phenomenon of interest. In order to provide better tools to meteorologists and reduce system limitations, we have designed an integrated atmospheric visual analysis and exploration system for interactive analysis of weather data sets. Our system allows for the integrated visualization of 1D, 2D, and 3D atmospheric data sets in common meteorological grid structures and utilizes a variety of rendering techniques. These tools provide meteorologists with new abilities to analyze their data and answer questions on regions of interest, ranging from physics-based atmospheric rendering to illustrative rendering containing particles and glyphs. In this paper, we discuss the use and performance of our visual analysis for two important meteorological applications. The first application is warm rain formation in small cumulus clouds. In this, our three-dimensional, interactive visualization of modeled drop trajectories within spatially correlated fields from a cloud simulation has provided researchers with new insight. Our second application is improving and validating severe storm models, specifically the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model.

The cluster is used as a distributed graphics processing unit that both aggregates graphics power and graphics memory. A hardware-accelerated volume renderer runs in parallel on the cluster nodes and the final image compositing is implemented using a pipelined sort-last rendering algorithm. Meanwhile, volume bricking and volume paging allow efficient data caching. On each rendering node, a distributed hierarchical cache system implements a global software-based distributed shared memory on the cluster. In case of a cache miss, this system first checks page residency on the other cluster nodes instead of directly accessing local disks. Using two gigabit Ethernet network interfaces per node, we accelerate data fetching by a factor of 4 compared to directly accessing local disks.

GyVe provides visualization techniques tailored to examine structures defined by the intercluster galaxies. Specific techniques include: interactive user control to move between a global overview and local viewpoints, labelled axes and curved drop lines to indicate positions in the astronomical RA-DEC-cz coordinate system, torsional rocking and stereo to enhance 3D perception, and geometrically distinct glyphs to show potential correlation between intercluster galaxies and known clusters. We discuss the rationale for each design decision and review the success of the techniques in accomplishing the scientific goals. In practice, GyVe has been useful for gaining intuition about structures that were difficult to perceive with 2D projection techniques alone. For example, during their initial session with GyVe, our collaborators quickly confirmed scientific conclusions regarding the large-scale structure of the HRS previously obtained over months of study with 2D projections and statistical techniques. Further use of GyVe revealed the spherical shape of voids and showed that a presumed filament was actually two disconnected structures.","article_number":"4015476","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4015476","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4015476/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4015476/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4015412,"publication_year":2006,"publication_date":"Sept.-Oct. 2006","start_page":"1149","end_page":"1156","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":294,"insert_date":"20061120","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Astronomy","Collaboration","Shape","Collaborative tools","Computer science","Control systems","Large-scale systems","Spectroscopy","Space technology"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Sparse point visualization","astronomy","cosmology"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2006.123","title":"Caricaturistic Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"5","issn":"2160-9306","rank":79,"volume":"12","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, University of Technology, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37828701300","id":37828701300,"full_name":"Peter Rautek","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, University of Technology, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282726800","id":37282726800,"full_name":"Ivan Viola","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, University of Technology, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282552200","id":37282552200,"full_name":"M.

Exploded views, on the other hand, do not suffer from this drawback. Our approach employs a force-based model: the volume is divided into a part configuration controlled by a number of forces and constraints. The focus object exerts an explosion force causing the parts to arrange according to the given constraints. We show that this novel and flexible approach allows for a wide variety of explosion-based visualizations including view-dependent explosions. Furthermore, we present a high-quality GPU-based volume ray casting algorithm for exploded views which allows rendering and interaction at several frames per second.","article_number":"4015468","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4015468","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4015468/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4015468/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4015412,"publication_year":2006,"publication_date":"Sept.-Oct. 2006","start_page":"1085","end_page":"1092","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":356,"insert_date":"20061120","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Focusing","Context","Evolution (biology)","Art","Humans","Face","Brain modeling","Computer graphics","Quality control"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["illustrative visualization","exploded views","volume rendering"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2006.195","title":"Visualization and Analysis of Large Data Collections: a Case Study Applied to Confocal Microscopy Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"5","issn":"2160-9306","rank":80,"volume":"12","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Swammerdam Inst. for Life Sci.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37327212900","id":37327212900,"full_name":"W. de Leeuw","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Swammerdam Inst. for Life Sci."]}},{"affiliation":"Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences (SILS), Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37340174000","id":37340174000,"full_name":"Pernette Verschure","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences (SILS), Netherlands"]}},{"authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282925600","id":37282925600,"full_name":"R. van Liere","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":null}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this paper we propose an approach in which interactive visualization and analysis are combined with batch tools for the processing of large data collections.

In the process, a number of capabilities have been introduced, including streaming of data in chunks, distributed pipelines, and demand-driven processing. Visualization systems have invariably built on stateful programming technologies, and these capabilities have had to be implemented explicitly within the lower layers of a complex hierarchy of services. The good news for developers is that applications built on top of this hierarchy can access these capabilities without concern for how they are implemented. The bad news is that by freezing capabilities into low-level services expressive power and flexibility is lost. In this paper we express visualization systems in a programming language that more naturally supports this kind of processing model. Lazy functional languages support fine-grained demand-driven processing, a natural form of streaming, and pipeline-like function composition for assembling applications. The technology thus appears well suited to visualization applications. Using surface extraction algorithms as illustrative examples, and the lazy functional language Haskell, we argue the benefits of clear and concise expression combined with fine-grained, demand-driven computation.

We address the utilization of this universal technique for the interaction with complex two-dimensional data considering the exploration of large graphs and other examples.","article_number":"4015438","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4015438","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4015438/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4015438/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4015412,"publication_year":2006,"publication_date":"Sept.-Oct. 2006","start_page":"845","end_page":"852","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":241,"insert_date":"20061120","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Shape","Conformal mapping","Data visualization","Nonlinear distortion","Image coding","Navigation","Image recognition","Information science","Information geometry","Computer graphics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Detail in context","complex logarithm","conformal mappings","analytic functions","interaction."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2006.153","title":"Interactive Point-based Isosurface Exploration and High-quality Rendering","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"5","issn":"2160-9306","rank":84,"volume":"12","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37280794900","id":37280794900,"full_name":"Haitao Zhang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Stony Brook University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268052800","id":37268052800,"full_name":"Arie Kaufman","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Stony Brook University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present an efficient point-based isosurface exploration system with high quality rendering. Our system incorporates two point-based isosurface extraction and visualization methods: edge splatting and the edge kernel method. In a volume, two neighboring voxels define an edge. The intersection points between the active edges and the isosurface are used for exact isosurface representation. The point generation is incorporated in the GPU-based hardware-accelerated rendering, thus avoiding any overhead when changing the isovalue in the exploration. We call this method edge splatting. In order to generate high quality isosurface rendering regardless of the volume resolution and the view, we introduce an edge kernel method. The edge kernel upsamples the isosurface by subdividing every active cell of the volume data. Enough sample points are generated to preserve the exact shape of the isosurface defined by the trilinear interpolation of the volume data.

Using a camera placed at a fixed position, particle motions can be visualized by rendering trajectories or by animations. Applying such direct techniques to large, time dependent particle data sets often results in cluttered images in which the dynamic properties of the underlying system are difficult to interpret. In this case study we take an alternative approach to the visualization of ion motions. Instead of rendering ion position data directly, we first extract meaningful motion information from the ion position data and then map this information onto geometric primitives. Our goal is to produce high-level visualizations that reflect the physicists' way of thinking about ion dynamics. Parameterized geometric icons are defined to encode motion information of clusters of related ions. In addition, a parameterized camera control mechanism is used to analyze relative instead of only absolute ion motions. We apply the techniques to simulations of Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS) experiments. The data produced by such simulations can amount to 5.104 ions and 105 timesteps.

We exploit span space extraction techniques to retrieve operations necessary to update isosurface geometry from neighboring time steps. Because only the changes between time steps need to be retrieved from disk, I/O bandwidth requirements are minimized. We apply temporal compression to further reduce disk access and employ a point-based previewing technique that is refined in idle interaction cycles.

A visual impression of the local properties of tensor fields is often complex and the search of a suitable technique for achieving this is an ongoing topic in visualization. This paper introduces and assesses a method of representing the topological properties of tensor fields and their respective flow patterns with the use of colors. First, a tensor norm is introduced, which preserves the properties of the tensor and assigns the tensor invariants to values of the RGB color space. Secondly, the RGB colors of the tensor invariants are transferred to corresponding hue values as an alternative color representation. The vectorial tensor invariants field is reduced to a scalar hue field and visualization of iso-surfaces of this hue value field allows us to identify locations with equivalent flow topology. Additionally highlighting by the maximum of the eigenvalue difference field reflects the magnitude of the structural change of the flow. The method is applied on a vortex breakdown flow structure inside a cylinder with a rotating lid","article_number":"4015481","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4015481","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4015481/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4015481/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":4015412,"publication_year":2006,"publication_date":"Sept.-Oct. 2006","start_page":"1189","end_page":"1196","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":228,"insert_date":"20061120","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Electric breakdown","Color","Tensile stress","Topology","Data visualization","Fluid dynamics","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Information analysis","Aerodynamics","Australia"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Flow visualization","Tensor field Topology","Invariants"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2006.127","title":"Composite Rectilinear Deformation for Stretch and Squish Navigation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"5","issn":"2160-9306","rank":88,"volume":"12","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of British Columbia, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37561415800","id":37561415800,"full_name":"James Slack","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of British Columbia, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of British Columbia, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349490300","id":37349490300,"full_name":"Tamara Munzner","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of British Columbia, Canada"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present the first scalable algorithm that supports the composition of successive rectilinear deformations. Earlier systems that provided stretch and squish navigation could only handle small datasets. More recent work featuring rubber sheet navigation for large datasets has focused on rendering and on application-specific issues. However, no algorithm has yet been presented for carrying out such navigation methods; our paper addresses this problem. For maximum flexibility with large datasets, a stretch and squish navigation algorithm should allow for millions of potentially deformable regions. However, typical usage only changes the extents of a small subset k of these n regions at a time. The challenge is to avoid computations that are linear in n, because a single deformation can affect the absolute screen-space location of every deformable region. We provide an O(klogn) algorithm that supports any application that can lay out a dataset on a generic grid, and show an implementation that allows navigation of trees and gene sequences with millions
