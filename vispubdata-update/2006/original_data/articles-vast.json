In this paper we address several aspects of the issue through a study of more than 3,000 Amazon customer reviews of the controversial bestseller The Da Vinci Code, including 1,738 positive and 918 negative reviews. The study is motivated by critical questions such as: what are the differences between positive and negative reviews? What is the origin of a particular opinion? How do these opinions change over time? To what extent can differentiating features be identified from unstructured text? How accurately can these features predict the category of a review? We first analyze terminology variations in these reviews in terms of syntactic, semantic, and statistic associations identified by TermWatch and use term variation patterns to depict underlying topics. We then select the most predictive terms based on log likelihood tests and demonstrate that this small set of terms classifies over 70% of the conflicting reviews correctly. This feature selection process reduces the dimensionality of the feature space from more than 20,000 dimensions to a couple of hundreds. We utilize automatically generated decision trees to facilitate the understanding of conflicting opinions in terms of these highly predictive terms.

Semantic image analysis techniques, which automatically detect high level semantic contents of images for annotation, are promising solutions toward this problem. However, few efforts have been made to convey the annotation results to users in an intuitive manner to enable effective image browsing and retrieval. There is also a lack of methods to monitor and evaluate the automatic image analysis algorithms due to the high dimensional nature of image data, features, and contents. In this paper, we propose a novel, scalable semantic image browser by applying existing information visualization techniques to semantic image analysis. This browser not only allows users to effectively browse and search in large image databases according to the semantic content of images, but also allows analysts to evaluate their annotation process through interactive visual exploration. The major visualization components of this browser are multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) based image layout, the value and relation (VaR) display that allows effective high dimensional visualization without dimension reduction, and a rich set of interaction tools such as search by sample images and content relationship detection.

An important first step, before analysis can begin, is ensuring that the data is accurate. A common data quality problem is that the data may inadvertently contain several distinct references to the same underlying entity; the process of reconciling these references is called entity-resolution. D-Dupe is an interactive tool that combines data mining algorithms for entity resolution with a task-specific network visualization. Users cope with complexity of cleaning large networks by focusing on a small subnetwork containing a potential duplicate pair. The subnetwork highlights relationships in the social network, making the common relationships easy to visually identify. D-Dupe users resolve ambiguities either by merging nodes or by marking them distinct. The entity resolution process is iterative: as pairs of nodes are resolved, additional duplicates may be revealed; therefore, resolution decisions are often chained together. We give examples of how users can flexibly apply sequences of actions to produce a high quality entity resolution result. We illustrate and evaluate the benefits of D-Dupe on three bibliographic collections. Two of the datasets had already been cleaned, and therefore should not have contained duplicates; despite this fact, many duplicates were rapidly identified using D-Dupe's unique combination of entity resolution algorithms within a task-specific visual interface","article_number":"4035746","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4035746","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035746/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035746/","publication_title":"2006 IEEE Symposium On Visual Analytics Science And Technology","conference_location":"Baltimore, MD, USA","conference_dates":"31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2006","publication_number":4035729,"is_number":4035730,"publication_year":2006,"publication_date":"31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2006","start_page":"43","end_page":"50","citing_paper_count":40,"citing_patent_count":2,"download_count":749,"insert_date":"20061226","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Collaboration","Visualization","Task analysis","Layout","Tools","Substrates","Social networking (online)"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data cleaning and integration","user interfaces","visual analytics","visual data mining","H.2.8 [Information Systems]: Database Applications¿Data mining","H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: User Interfaces¿User-centered design"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0592-0","isbnType":"Historical"},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0591-2","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2006.261438","title":"Monitoring Network Traffic with Radial Traffic Analyzer","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"1-4244-0592-0","rank":7,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Databases, Data Mining and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","id":37283138700,"full_name":"Daniel A.

This is a progressive process in which newly synthesized knowledge becomes the foundation for future discovery. In this paper, we present a novel system supporting interactive, progressive synthesis of analytic knowledge. Here we use the term \"analytic knowledge\" to refer to concepts that a user derives from existing data along with the evidence supporting such concepts. Unlike existing visual analytic-tools, which typically support only exploration of existing information, our system offers two unique features. First, we support user-system cooperative visual synthesis of analytic knowledge from existing data. Specifically, users can visually define new concepts by annotating existing information, and refine partially formed concepts by linking additional evidence or manipulating related concepts. In response to user actions, our system can automatically manage the evolving corpus of synthesized knowledge and its corresponding evidence. Second, we support progressive visual analysis of synthesized knowledge. This feature allows analysts to visually explore both existing knowledge and synthesized knowledge, dynamically incorporating earlier analytic conclusions into the ensuing discovery process. We have applied our system to two complex but very different analytic applications.

Multidimensional visualization techniques are used with interactive, context-sensitive, and tunable graphs. Visual representations are flexibly generated using a knowledge representation scheme based on annotated logic; this enables not only tracking and fusing different viewpoints, but also unpacking them. Fusing representations supports the creation of multidimensional meta-displays as well as the translation or mapping from one point of view to another. At the same time, analysts also need to be able to unpack one another's complex chains of reasoning, especially if they have reached different conclusions, and to determine the implications, if any, when underlying assumptions or evidence turn out to be false.

For most of these techniques user interaction has become a crucial element, since there are many situations in which a user or an analyst has to select the right parameter settings from among many or select a subset of the available attribute space for the visualization process, in order to construct valuable visualizations that provide insight, into the data and reveal interesting patterns. The right choice of input parameters is often essential, since suboptimal parameter settings or the investigation of irrelevant data dimensions make the exploration process more time consuming and may result in wrong conclusions. In this paper we propose a novel method for automatically determining meaningful parameter- and attribute settings based on the information content of the resulting visualizations. Our technique called Pixnostics, in analogy to Scagnostics (Wilkinson et al., 2005), automatically analyses pixel images resulting from diverse parameter mappings and ranks them according to the potential value for the user. This allows a more effective and more efficient visual data analysis process, since the attribute/parameter space is reduced to meaningful selections and thus the analyst obtains faster insight into the data.

Analysis conducted on variable quality data can lead to inaccurate or incorrect results. An effective visualization system must make users aware of the quality of their data by explicitly conveying not only the actual data content, but also its quality attributes. While some research has been conducted on visualizing uncertainty in spatio-temporal data and univariate data, little work has been reported on extending this capability into multivariate data visualization. In this paper we describe our approach to the problem of visually exploring multivariate data with variable quality. As a foundation, we propose a general approach to defining quality measures for tabular data, in which data may experience quality problems at three granularities: individual data values, complete records, and specific dimensions. We then present two approaches to visual mapping of quality information into display space. In particular, one solution embeds the quality measures as explicit values into the original dataset by regarding value quality and record quality as new data dimensions. The other solution is to superimpose the quality information within the data visualizations using additional visual variables. We also report on user studies conducted to assess alternate mappings of quality attributes to visual variables for the second method. In addition, we describe case studies that expose some of the advantages and disadvantages of these two approaches","article_number":"4035764","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4035764","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035764/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035764/","publication_title":"2006 IEEE Symposium On Visual Analytics Science And Technology","conference_location":"Baltimore, MD, USA","conference_dates":"31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2006","publication_number":4035729,"is_number":4035730,"publication_year":2006,"publication_date":"31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2006","start_page":"183","end_page":"190","citing_paper_count":23,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":774,"insert_date":"20061226","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Uncertainty","Humans","Data mining","Information analysis","Computer science","Estimation error","Computer errors","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty visualization","multivariate visualization","data quality","H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: User Interfaces-Graphical user interfaces"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0592-0","isbnType":"Historical"},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0591-2","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2006.261437","title":"Accelerating Network Traffic Analytics Using Query-Driven Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"1-4244-0592-0","rank":15,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computational Research Division","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38550755500","id":38550755500,"full_name":"E.

Knowledge about individuals in an organization and their relationships, often represented as a hierarchical organization chart, is crucial for understanding the organization. However, it is difficult for intelligence analysts to follow all individuals in an organization. Existing hierarchy visualizations have largely focused on the visualization of fixed structures and can not effectively depict the evolution of a hierarchy over time. We introduce TimeTree, a novel visualization tool designed to enable exploration of a changing hierarchy. TimeTree enables analysts to navigate the history of an organization, identify events associated with a specific entity (visualized on a TimeSlider), and explore an aggregate view of an individual's career path (a CareerTree).

With the constant improvement in wireless network access, they are an attractive option not only for day to day use. but also for in-field analytics by first responders in widespread areas. However, their limited processing, display, graphics and power resources pose a major challenge in developing effective applications. Nevertheless, they are vital for rapid decision making in emergencies when combined with appropriate analysis tools. In this paper, we present an efficient, interactive visual analytic system using a PDA to visualize network information from Purdue's Ross-Ade Stadium during football games as an example of in-held data analytics combined with text and video analysis. With our system, we can monitor the distribution of attendees with mobile devices throughout the stadium through their access of information and association/disassociation from wireless access points, enabling the detection of crowd movement and event activity. Through correlative visualization and analysis of synchronized video (instant replay video) and text information (play statistics) with the network activity, we can provide insightful information to network monitoring personnel, safety personnel and analysts.

They are used to regularly check portions of a dataset and to explore a new dataset for the first time. In this paper, we establish criteria for OLAP user interface capabilities to facilitate comparison. Two criteria are the number of displayed dimensions along which comparisons can be made and the number of dimensions that are viewable at once - visual comparison depth and width. We argue that interfaces with greater visual comparison depth support regular checking of known data by users that know roughly where to look, while interfaces with greater comparison width support exploration of new data by users that have no a priori starting point and need to scan all dimensions. Pivot tables and Polaris are examples of the former. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a new scalable interface that uses parallel dimension axis which supports the latter, greater visual comparison width.

Visual identification and comparison of patterns of recurring events is an essential feature of such tools. In this paper, we describe a tool for exploring hotel visitation patterns in and around Rebersburg, Pennsylvania from 1898-1900. The tool uses a wrapping spreadsheet technique, called reruns, to display cyclic patterns of geographic events in multiple overlapping natural and artificial calendars.

Only by understanding the events that produced the climatic conditions in the past will it be possible to forecast abrupt climate changes and prevent disastrous consequences for human beings and their environment. Paleoceanography research is a collaborative effort that requires the analysis of paleo time-series, which are obtained from a number of independent techniques and instruments and produced by a variety of different researchers and/or laboratories. The complexity of these phenomena that consist of massive, dynamic and often conflicting data can only be faced by means of analytical reasoning supported by a highly interactive visual interface.

This paper develops an approach, interactive visualization of wormholes (IVoW), to monitor and detect such attacks in large scale wireless networks in real time. We characterize the topology features of a network under wormhole attacks through the node position changes and visualize the information at dynamically adjusted scales. We integrate an automatic detection algorithm with appropriate user interactions to handle complicated scenarios that include a large number of moving nodes and multiple worm-hole attackers. Various visual forms have been adopted to assist the understanding and analysis of the reconstructed network topology and improve the detection accuracy. Extended simulation has demonstrated that the proposed approach can effectively locate the fake neighbor connections without introducing many false alarms. IVoW does not require the wireless nodes to be equipped with any special hardware, thus avoiding any additional cost. The proposed approach demonstrates that interactive visualization can be successfully combined with network security mechanisms to greatly improve the intrusion detection capabilities","article_number":"4035753","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4035753","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035753/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035753/","publication_title":"2006 IEEE Symposium On Visual Analytics Science And Technology","conference_location":"Baltimore, MD, USA","conference_dates":"31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2006","publication_number":4035729,"is_number":4035730,"publication_year":2006,"publication_date":"31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2006","start_page":"99","end_page":"106","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":255,"insert_date":"20061226","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Large-scale systems","Wireless networks","Visualization","Network topology","Routing protocols","Information security","Monitoring","Detection algorithms","Communication system security","Hardware"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Interactive Detection","Wormhole Attacks","Visualization on Network Security","Wireless Networks","Topology Visualization","C.2.0 [Computer-Communication Networks]: General¿Security and protection","H.5.2 [Information Systems]: Information Interfaces and Presentation¿User interfaces"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0592-0","isbnType":"Historical"},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0591-2","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2006.261418","title":"Scentindex: Conceptually Reorganizing Subject Indexes for Reading","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"1-4244-0592-0","rank":26,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Palo Alto Research Center, Inc.orporated, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37448030800","id":37448030800,"full_name":"Ed H.

Visual analytic environments, therefore, must encompass reading tools that enable the rapid digestion of large amount of reading material. Other than plain text search, subject indexes, and basic highlighting, tools are needed for rapid foraging of text. In this paper, we describe a technique that presents an enhanced subject index for a book by conceptually reorganizing it to suit particular expressed user information needs. Users first enter information needs via keywords describing the concepts they are trying to retrieve and comprehend. Then our system, called ScentIndex, computes what index entries are conceptually related and reorganizes and displays these index entries on a single page. We also provide a number of navigational cues to help users peruse over this list of index entries and find relevant passages quickly.

We describe analysis algorithms to derive various spatial and spatio-temporal relationships. A visual interface is presented using which the user can interactively select spatial and temporal extents to guide the knowledge discovery process.
