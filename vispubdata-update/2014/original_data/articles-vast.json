Analyzing clickstreams on MOOC videos poses a special analytical challenge but provides a good opportunity for understanding how students interact with course videos, which in turn can help instructors and educational analysts gain insights into online learning behavior. In this poster, we develop a visual analytical system, VisMOOC, to help instructors analyze the clickstream data. VisMOOC consists of three main views: the List View to list all course videos for analysts to select the video they are interested in; the Content-based View to show how each type of click actions change along the video timeline, which enables the most viewed sections to be observed and the most interesting patterns to be discovered; The Dashboard View shows the information of the clickstream data in different aspects, including the course information, the geographic distribution, the video temporal information, the video popularity, and the animation. Furthermore, case studies made by the instructors demonstrate the usefulness of VisMOOC and helped them gaining deep insights into learning behavior for MOOCs.","article_number":"7042528","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042528","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042528/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042528/","publication_title":"2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Paris, France","conference_dates":"25-31 Oct. 2014","publication_number":7027279,"is_number":7042473,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"25-31 Oct. 2014","start_page":"277","end_page":"278","citing_paper_count":25,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":605,"insert_date":"20150216","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Data visualization","Animation","Image color analysis","Presses","Abstracts","Streaming media"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Online Courses","Online Classes","Massive Open Online Courses","MOOCs","Open Online Courses","Massive Open Online","Clickstream Data","Visual System","Learning Behavior","Popular Video","Main View","Education Courses","Video Data","Online Video","Video Content","Chinese Learners","Video Lectures"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6227-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2014.7042511","title":"VisIRR: Visual analytics for information retrieval and recommendation with large-scale document data","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4799-6227-3","rank":2,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37602784600","id":37602784600,"full_name":"Jaegul Choo","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Google Inc.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077624100","id":37077624100,"full_name":"Changhyun Lee","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Google Inc."]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085351744","id":37085351744,"full_name":"Hannah Kim","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37599320600","id":37599320600,"full_name":"Hanseung Lee","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland"]}},{"affiliation":"Adobe Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592993600","id":37592993600,"full_name":"Zhicheng Liu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Adobe Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086060810","id":37086060810,"full_name":"Ramakrishnan Kannan","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490190000","id":38490190000,"full_name":"Charles D.

This paper describes our first step in this direction and gives an overview of a system that allows the user to guide the execution of a pattern-growth algorithm at suitable points, through a powerful visual interface.","article_number":"7042532","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042532","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042532/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042532/","publication_title":"2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Paris, France","conference_dates":"25-31 Oct. 2014","publication_number":7027279,"is_number":7042473,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"25-31 Oct. 2014","start_page":"285","end_page":"286","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":153,"insert_date":"20150216","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data mining","Visualization","Educational institutions","Databases","Heuristic algorithms","User interfaces"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["H.5.2: User Interfaces","H.2.8: Data mining"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive Visualization","Sequential Pattern Mining","Itemset Mining","Sequence Mining","Step In This Direction","Step In That Direction","Sequence Patterns","Applications In Various Fields","Applications In A Variety Of Fields","Lack Of Focus","Algorithm Execution","Visual Interface","Pattern Mining","Current Status","Current Conditions","Node Size","Process Mining","Pattern Length","Support Threshold"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6227-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2014.7042564","title":"Detecting suspicious behavior using a graph-based approach","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4799-6227-3","rank":9,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Tennessee Tech University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085525443","id":37085525443,"full_name":"Lenin Mookiah","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tennessee Tech University"]}},{"affiliation":"Tennessee Tech University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37573606300","id":37573606300,"full_name":"William Eberle","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tennessee Tech University"]}},{"affiliation":"Washington State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37347302800","id":37347302800,"full_name":"Lawrence Holder","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Washington State University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"The ability to discover illicit behavior in complex, heterogeneous data is a daunting problem.

In order to gather and combine the necessary tissue information, multi-modal imaging is used to derive a number of parameters indicative of tissue properties. The exploration and analysis of relationships between parameters and, especially, of differences among distinct intra-tumor regions is particularly interesting for clinical researchers to individualize tumor treatment. However, due to high data dimensionality and complexity, the current clinical workflow is time demanding and does not provide the necessary intra-tumor insight. We implemented a new application for the exploration of the relationships between parameters and heterogeneity within tumors. In our approach, we employ a well-known dimensionality reduction technique [5] to map the high-dimensional space of tissue properties into a 2D information space that can be interactively explored with integrated information visualization techniques. We conducted several usage scenarios with real-patient data, of which we present a case of advanced cervical cancer. First indications show that our application introduces new features and functionalities that are not available within the current clinical approach.","article_number":"7042521","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042521","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042521/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042521/","publication_title":"2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Paris, France","conference_dates":"25-31 Oct. 2014","publication_number":7027279,"is_number":7042473,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"25-31 Oct. 2014","start_page":"263","end_page":"264","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":248,"insert_date":"20150216","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Tumors","Educational institutions","Biomedical imaging","Visual analytics","Cancer"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["I.3.8 [Computer Graphics]: Applications — Applications","J.3 [Computer Applications]: Life and Medical Sciences — Life and Medical Sciences"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Multiparametric Imaging","High-dimensional","High-dimensional Space","Tissue Characteristics","Tissue Features","Role In Diagnosis","Time Demands","Usage Scenarios","Distinct Features","Distinct Characteristics","Tumor Heterogeneity","Heterogeneous Tumor","Tumor Regions","Space Analysis","Regional Heterogeneity","Heterogeneous Regions","Image Data Analysis","Voxel Level","Parallel Coordinates","Large Data Analysis","Scatterplot Matrix","Scatterplot Matrices","Multiparametric Data","t-SNE Map"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6227-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2014.7042580","title":"Visual analysis of streaming data with SAVI and SenseMAP","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4799-6227-3","rank":15,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Middlesex University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273812200","id":37273812200,"full_name":"Kai Xu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Middlesex University"]}},{"affiliation":"Middlesex University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490354300","id":38490354300,"full_name":"Phong H.

Therefore, it is important to know how emoticons work in online text communication.

Meanings of some places could be refined using the credit card transaction data. By representing the place meanings as points on a 2D plane, we built an abstract semantic space and transformed the original trajectories to trajectories in the semantic space. Spatio-temporal aggregation of the transformed trajectories into flows between the semantic places and subsequent clustering of time intervals by the similarity of the flow situations allowed us to reveal the routine movement behaviors. To detect anomalies, we (a) investigated the visits to the places with unknown meanings, and (b) looked for unusual presence times or visit durations at different semantic places.

Although visualization history has the potential to communicate such information, the common representations are often limited to sequential lists of past work. Such representations do not make it easy to understand the analytic coverage of the dimension space (i.e. which dimensions have been investigated and which have not). This makes it difficult for an analyst to plan their next steps, particularly when the number of dimensions is large. In this paper, we propose representing the prior analysis from a dimension coverage perspective. Dimension view provides a unique perspective that can facilitate exploratory analysis by enabling analysts to easily identify what dimensions have been examined and in what combinations. We hypothesize that addition of this view to common representations of visualization history will reduce cognitive and interaction costs by helping the analyst to discover data subsets to explore. We studied the effects of this view on a distributed collaborative visualization process. Our findings show that providing views of the dimension and data space reduces time required for identifying and investigating unexplored regions and increases the accuracy of this understanding. In addition, providing these views results in a larger coverage of entire dimension space.","article_number":"7042526","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042526","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042526/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042526/","publication_title":"2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Paris, France","conference_dates":"25-31 Oct. 2014","publication_number":7027279,"is_number":7042473,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"25-31 Oct. 2014","start_page":"273","end_page":"274","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":88,"insert_date":"20150216","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["History","Data visualization","Collaboration","Prototypes","Data analysis","Visualization","Navigation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Analysis History","Distributed Collaboration","Information Scent","Dimension Space Coverage"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Dimensional Space","Multidimensional Space","Common Representation","Coverage Of Space","Historical Representation","User Study","Dimensional Data","Prototype Tool","Visual Analytics Tool"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6227-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2014.7042530","title":"Studying propagation dynamics in networks through rule-based modeling","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4799-6227-3","rank":30,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Bordeaux, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085566227","id":37085566227,"full_name":"Jason Vallet","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bordeaux, France"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Bordeaux, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396011000","id":37396011000,"full_name":"Bruno Pinaud","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bordeaux, France"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Bordeaux, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283186100","id":37283186100,"full_name":"Guy Melançon","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bordeaux, France"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Modeling propagation dynamics on networks is an amazingly fertile and active area of research. Roughly speaking, network models aim at gaining a better understanding of how actors influence the overall network behaviour through their individual actions. However, considering the extended literature surrounding the subject, one is entitled to think that moving beyond the state-of-the-art in network modeling requires the ability to compare models, or consider slight variations of a model. This requires having a common language describing all considered models, allowing to objectively compare them and unfold their inherent properties and complexity. This also assumes users can easily run models, steer them and interactively evaluate their performance and behaviour. The approach we describe aims at providing a framework turning network propagation modeling into rule-based modeling (aka graph rewriting). That is, models are described as a set of algorithmic transformation rules acting locally. Our approach has partially been validated by providing such a description of a well-known model relying on probabilistic rules, where nodes trigger actions depending on their neighbor's influences. The results so obtained confirm rule-based modeling as a promising avenue. The use of a visual analytics framework to conduct such tasks is vital and motivated us to further develop and adapt a general purpose visual analytics system for graph rewriting to the particular case of network propagation.","article_number":"7042530","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042530","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042530/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042530/","publication_title":"2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Paris, France","conference_dates":"25-31 Oct. 2014","publication_number":7027279,"is_number":7042473,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"25-31 Oct. 2014","start_page":"281","end_page":"282","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":70,"insert_date":"20150216","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Mathematical model","Computational modeling","Analytical models","Visual analytics","Data mining","Adaptation models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["I.2.4 [Artificial Intelligence]: Knowledge Representation — Formalisms and Methods","F.1.2 [Computation by Abstract Devices]: Modes of Computation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Rule-based Model","Visual System","Visual Analysis","Common Language","Lingua Franca","Active Area Of Research","Propagation Model","Network Propagation","Visual Framework","Node Status","Lymph Node Status","Application Of Rules","Applicable Rules","Red Thread"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6227-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2014.7042498","title":"TimeGraph: A data management framework for visual analytics of large multivariate time-oriented networks","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4799-6227-3","rank":31,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Vienna University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085361518","id":37085361518,"full_name":"Albert Amor-Amorós","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Vienna University of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Vienna University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37569322900","id":37569322900,"full_name":"Paolo Federico","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Vienna University of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Vienna University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282584500","id":37282584500,"full_name":"Silvia Miksch","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Vienna University of Technology"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Large multivariate time-oriented networks have been gaining an increasing relevance in different domains.

TimeGraph aims to be an expressive, easy-to-use and extensible framework, enabling data reduction by selection and aggregation over both the temporal and the topological properties of data, to foster interactive visualization and analysis.","article_number":"7042498","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042498","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042498/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042498/","publication_title":"2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Paris, France","conference_dates":"25-31 Oct. 2014","publication_number":7027279,"is_number":7042473,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"25-31 Oct. 2014","start_page":"217","end_page":"218","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":201,"insert_date":"20150216","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data models","Data visualization","Visual analytics","Databases","Complexity theory","Calendars","Educational institutions"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Management","Large Networks","Visual Analysis","Data Management Framework","Data Model","Interaction Analysis","Kinds Of Data","Interactive Visualization","Graph Properties","Attributed Graph","Temporal Dimension","Time Dimension","Temporal Properties","Temporal Aspects","Graph Database","Topological Aspects","Temporal Granularity"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6227-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2014.7042538","title":"AnnotatedTimeTree, Dodeca-Rings Map & SMART: A geo-temporal analysis of criminal events","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4799-6227-3","rank":32,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085422417","id":37085422417,"full_name":"Chen Guo","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085405113","id":37085405113,"full_name":"Jing Xia","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088719178","id":37088719178,"full_name":"Jun Yu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085454267","id":37085454267,"full_name":"Jieqiong Zhao","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering"]}},{"affiliation":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085404512","id":37085404512,"full_name":"Jiawei Zhang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering"]}},{"affiliation":"Interaction Design, Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085554164","id":37085554164,"full_name":"Qiaoying Wang","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Interaction Design, Purdue University"]}},{"affiliation":"Interaction Design, Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38238364000","id":38238364000,"full_name":"Zhenyu Cheryl Qian","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Interaction Design, Purdue University"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38241087200","id":38241087200,"full_name":"Yingjie Victor Chen","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"New Media Technology & Art, Harbin Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085426720","id":37085426720,"full_name":"Chen Wang","author_order":9,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New Media Technology & Art, Harbin Institute of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282598900","id":37282598900,"full_name":"David Ebert","author_order":10,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"The 2014 VAST Grand Challenge required us to find victims, suspects, and criminal motivations based on three separate dataseis.

The task was to identify relevant events and outliers in the data and highlight observations that are connected to an earlier kidnapping of employees from a company called GASTECH. In contrast to earlier challenges, the focus was on real-time data processing. The microblog messages were hosted on a web-server that simulated real-time streaming of the data during a 4.5 hour period and the challenge participants had to monitor and analyze them as they were transmitted. To tackle the challenge we developed ScatterScopes, a real-time enabled visual analytics system that fosters understanding of ongoing events by means of spatiotemporal overview and hierarchical drilldown. Trends and anomalies in space, time and content can be quickly identified with the system using interactive maps, sentiment timelines and textual search. Once interesting or suspicious subsets of elements are selected, their inherent topic structure can be further dissected based on a highly interactive treemap of message clusters. Subset selection and recombination is furthermore supported by a filter-and-flow mechanism that can also be used to formulate and test hypotheses based on Boolean logic. ScatterScopes has been used by our team to successfully identify and describe all events hidden in the MC3 data streams.","article_number":"7042579","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042579","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042579/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042579/","publication_title":"2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Paris, France","conference_dates":"25-31 Oct. 2014","publication_number":7027279,"is_number":7042473,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"25-31 Oct. 2014","start_page":"387","end_page":"388","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":144,"insert_date":"20150216","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Real-time systems","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Market research","Sentiment analysis","Urban areas","Monitoring","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["User Interfaces","Information Search and Retrieval","Social Media"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Recombination","Meiosis","Meiotic","Search String","Text Search","String Matching","Boolean Logic","Logic Functions","Logic Operations","Interaction Map","Outlier Data","Subset Selection","Treemap","Functional Tree","Performance Of Trees","Real-time Data Processing","Cloud Data","Word Cloud","Control Panel","Lower Plot","Broader Frame","Broad Frame"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6227-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2014.7042507","title":"Balanced layouts using the composite data-variable matrix","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4799-6227-3","rank":57,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, Songdo, NY, Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085387617","id":37085387617,"full_name":"Shenghui Cheng","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, Songdo, NY, Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, Songdo, NY, Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073902300","id":37073902300,"full_name":"Bing Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, Songdo, NY, Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, Songdo, NY, Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38025124400","id":38025124400,"full_name":"Zhiyuan Zhang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, Songdo, NY, Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, Songdo, NY, Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273119700","id":37273119700,"full_name":"Klaus Mueller","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, Songdo, NY, Korea"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Numerous methods have been described that allow the visualization of the data-variable matrix. But all suffer from a common problem-visualizing the data and variable points separately which is hard for people to catch the relations in data and variables together. We describe a method that allows data and variables balanced layouts. We achieve it by combining two distance matrices typically used in isolation - the distance matrix encoding the similarities of the variables and the distance matrix encoding the similarity of the data points. The remaining two submatrices are obtained by creating a fused distance matrix - one that measures the distance of data points with respect to the variables or vice versa. We then use MDS to simultaneously optimize the placement of data points and variable points, producing a display that allows users to appreciate all three types of relationships in a single display: (1) the patterns of the collection of data items, (2) the patterns of the collection of variables, and (3) the relationships of data items with the variables and vice versa.","article_number":"7042507","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042507","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042507/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042507/","publication_title":"2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Paris, France","conference_dates":"25-31 Oct. 2014","publication_number":7027279,"is_number":7042473,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"25-31 Oct. 2014","start_page":"235","end_page":"236","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":79,"insert_date":"20150216","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Layout","Vectors","Data visualization","Symmetric matrices","Visual analytics","Encoding","Linear matrix inequalities"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Matrix Composites","Distance Matrix","Distance Matrices","Types Of Relationships","Submatrix","Submatrices","Data Matrix","Data Matrices","Linear Discriminant Analysis","Discriminant Function","Discriminant Function Analysis","Data Space","Variable Space","Dissimilarity Metrics"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6227-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2014.7042550","title":"VAST challenge 2014: Mini-challenge 1","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4799-6227-3","rank":58,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Chinese Academy of Sciences","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085549357","id":37085549357,"full_name":"Qiang Song","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Chinese Academy of Sciences","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087338670","id":37087338670,"full_name":"Rui Li","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Chinese Academy of Sciences","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087338982","id":37087338982,"full_name":"Peng Yin","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"We address the Mini Task I of Min-Challenge I, pluging in knowledge and some techniques of data mining and information visualization into our assignment.

tracking data, loyalty and credit card logs of employees from a fictitious company, GAStech, participants of VAST 2014 mini challenge 2 were tasked to extract the common daily routine of employees and identify any suspicious activities that may be present in the data. In this paper, we reflect on our analysis procedure focusing on each step of the process that contributed to problem solving. Accordingly, we describe the features incorporated into our software at each stage of the process and justify the design decisions that were made. Inspired by DiBiase's approach to visual analysis [1], our procedure consists of three stages (Fig. 1). With off-the-shelf software, such as R and QGIS, we conducted exploratory data analysis [2] to generate a diverse range of insights. The insights were evaluated based on their relevance to the given task. They were used to formulate hypotheses and data task abstraction [3] resulting in a set of complementary tools comprising of an origin-destination map, a timeline and a flow diagram that we developed in processing. These tools were not designed to function as an integrated software package but were treated as rapid prototypes that would afford more flexibility in the design and development cycle [4].","article_number":"7042560","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042560","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042560/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042560/","publication_title":"2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Paris, France","conference_dates":"25-31 Oct. 2014","publication_number":7027279,"is_number":7042473,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"25-31 Oct. 2014","start_page":"349","end_page":"350","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":122,"insert_date":"20150216","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Credit cards","Electronic mail","Splines (mathematics)","Software","Visualization","Employment"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Processing Steps","Exploratory Analysis","Exploratory Data Analysis","Stages Of Process","Flow Diagram","Flexible Design","Development Cycle","Credit Card","Loyalty Programs","Reward Program","Reward Points","Loyalty Card","Line Segment","Representation Of Movement","Card Transactions"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6227-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2014.7042527","title":"mailVis: Visualizing emailbox for re-finding emails","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4799-6227-3","rank":63,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Design, Aalto University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088158119","id":37088158119,"full_name":"Banş Serim","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Design, Aalto University","Department of Computer Science, University of Helsinki"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of Helsinki","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085575312","id":37085575312,"full_name":"Vuong Thanh Tung","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Helsinki"]}},{"affiliation":"Helsinki Institute for Information Technology HIIT, Aalto University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37705108800","id":37705108800,"full_name":"Tuukka Ruotsalo","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Helsinki Institute for Information Technology HIIT, Aalto University"]}},{"affiliation":"Helsinki Institute for Information Technology HIIT, Aalto University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490161300","id":38490161300,"full_name":"Luana Micallef","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Helsinki Institute for Information Technology HIIT, Aalto University"]}},{"affiliation":"Helsinki Institute for Information Technology HIIT, Aalto University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586709000","id":37586709000,"full_name":"Giulio Jacucci","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Helsinki Institute for Information Technology HIIT, Aalto University","Department of Computer Science, University of Helsinki"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"We present the design and implementation of mailVis, an interactive visual interface for email boxes that facilitates re-finding of emails.

We present our early prototype for the visual exploration of event sequences and patterns. Our approach combines (1) a visual representation of event sequences emphasizing recurring event patterns, (2) automated pattern mining methods, as well as (3) interactive means for exploration.

Most automated approaches rely on segmenting the individual spots, which becomes unreliable when the image contains artifacts, noise, or confounding objects. Therefore, practitioners often resort to tedious and time-consuming manual counting and measurements. As an alternative, we propose a visual analytics approach to this problem. It is based on Total Variation Flow, a partial differential equation that changes the intensities of image regions at a rate inverse to their scale. From this, we derive novel quantitative per-pixel measures of scale and density, and we show how the results can be combined with tools for visualization and selection to achieve a fast summary of median size and spot density in an image. Given a set of images, our framework places them on a 2D map that makes it easy to quickly compare them with respect to spot sizes and density. Our system is applied to real-world data from Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy.","article_number":"7042516","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042516","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042516/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042516/","publication_title":"2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Paris, France","conference_dates":"25-31 Oct. 2014","publication_number":7027279,"is_number":7042473,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"25-31 Oct. 2014","start_page":"253","end_page":"254","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":44,"insert_date":"20150216","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["TV","Image segmentation","Noise","Size measurement","Educational institutions","Visual analytics","Density measurement"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Homogeneous Background","Total Variance","Total Diversity","Visual Analysis","Measurement Scale","Density Measurements","Image Regions","Partial Differential Equations","PDEs","Total Flow","Number Of Spots","Biological Imaging","Stimulated Emission Depletion","Density Of Spots","Degree Of Smoothness","Total Variation Regularization","Total Variation Denoising","Foreground Pixels","Visual Framework","Circular Spot","Spot Count"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6227-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2014.7042555","title":"VAST 2014 Mini-challenge 1: Team Aptima","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4799-6227-3","rank":78,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Aptima, Inc.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37548028800","id":37548028800,"full_name":"Caroline Ziemkiewicz","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Aptima, Inc."]}},{"affiliation":"Aptima, Inc.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085554032","id":37085554032,"full_name":"Adam Fouse","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Aptima, Inc."]}},{"affiliation":"Aptima, Inc.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38073439100","id":38073439100,"full_name":"Gabriel Ganberg","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Aptima, Inc."]}},{"affiliation":"Aptima, Inc.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085551324","id":37085551324,"full_name":"Ryan Mullins","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Aptima, Inc."]}},{"affiliation":"Aptima, Inc.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085550031","id":37085550031,"full_name":"Stacy Pfautz","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Aptima, Inc."]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"We present a prototype visual analytics tool for facilitating analysis in a collaborative team setting by providing a flexible platform for visualizing and exploring multiple linked dataseis as a unified graph model.

At each of these levels, there is a wealth of information that can inform inquiry - from statistical models, to metadata, to the researcher's own knowledge and expertise. Joining all this information together can be a challenge, and there are issues of scale to be combatted along the way. In this paper, we describe an approach to text analysis that addresses these challenges of scale and multiple information sources, using probabilistic topic models to structure exploration through multiple levels of inquiry in a way that fosters serendipitous discovery. In implementing this approach into a tool called Serendip, we incorporate topic model data and metadata into a highly reorderable matrix to expose corpus level trends; extend encodings of tagged text to illustrate probabilistic information at a passage level; and introduce a technique for visualizing individual word rankings, along with interaction techniques and new statistical methods to create links between different levels and information types. We describe example uses from both the humanities and visualization research that illustrate the benefits of our approach.","article_number":"7042493","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042493","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042493/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042493/","publication_title":"2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Paris, France","conference_dates":"25-31 Oct. 2014","publication_number":7027279,"is_number":7042473,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"25-31 Oct. 2014","start_page":"173","end_page":"182","citing_paper_count":68,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1311,"insert_date":"20150216","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Measurement","Market research","Data models","Data visualization","Probabilistic logic","Adaptation models","Vectors"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Text visualization","topic modeling"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Text Data","Text Corpus","Source Of Information","Metadata","Serendipitous","Serendipity","Topic Modeling","Research Level","Scalability Issues","Individual Words","Multiple Sources Of Information","Serendipitous Discovery","Serendipitous Finding","Large Text","Interaction Techniques","Large Text Corpora","Large Text Corpus","Multiple Levels Of Abstraction","Topical","Similarity Measure","Similarity Metrics","Types Of Information","Subject Of Interest","Topics Of Interest","Information Gain","Access Points","Topic Words","Subject Words","Theme Words","Library Books","Distance Metrics","Different Types Of Information","Trust Model","Proportion Of Subjects","Unit Of Interest","Word Level","Termites","Intermediate Results","Intermediate Outcomes"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6227-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2014.7042477","title":"Feature-driven visual analytics of soccer data","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4799-6227-3","rank":87,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University oj Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37594026300","id":37594026300,"full_name":"Halld'or Janetzko","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University oj Konstanz"]}},{"affiliation":"University oj Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085566394","id":37085566394,"full_name":"Dominik Sacha","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University oj Konstanz"]}},{"affiliation":"University oj Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085573450","id":37085573450,"full_name":"Manuel Stein","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University oj Konstanz"]}},{"affiliation":"University oj Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282557600","id":37282557600,"full_name":"Tobias Schreck","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University oj Konstanz"]}},{"affiliation":"University oj Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","id":37283138700,"full_name":"Daniel A.

The integration of Visual Analytics techniques into the analysis process enables the analyst to find interesting events based on classification and allows, by a set of custom views, to communicate the found results. The feedback loop in the Visual Analytics pipeline helps to further improve the classification results.

The full picture consists of a number of common topics among multiple sources as well as distinctive topics. The key idea behind our approach is to jointly match the topics extracted from each source together in order to interactively and effectively analyze common and distinctive topics. We start by modeling each textual corpus as a topic graph. These graphs are then matched together with a consistent graph matching method. Next, we develop an LOD-based visualization for better understanding and analysis of the matched graph. The major feature of this visualization is that it combines a radially stacked tree visualization with a density-based graph visualization to facilitate the examination of the matched topic graph from multiple perspectives. To compensate for the deficiency of the graph matching algorithm and meet different users' needs, we allow users to interactively modify the graph matching result. We have applied our approach to various data including news, tweets, and blog data. Qualitative evaluation and a real-world case study with domain experts demonstrate the promise of our approach, especially in support of analyzing a topic-graph-based full picture at different levels of detail.","article_number":"7042494","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042494","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042494/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042494/","publication_title":"2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Paris, France","conference_dates":"25-31 Oct. 2014","publication_number":7027279,"is_number":7042473,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"25-31 Oct. 2014","start_page":"183","end_page":"192","citing_paper_count":52,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":1283,"insert_date":"20150216","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Government","Internet","Correlation","Google","Algorithm design and analysis","Layout"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Topic graph","graph matching","graph visualization","user interactions","level-of-detail"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Common Themes","Common Topics","Text Data","Text Corpus","Domain Experts","Matching Results","Match Outcome","Visibility Graph","Distinct Themes","Distinct Topics","Distinct Subjects","Graph Matching","Visual Comparison","Related Topics","Related Themes","Related Subjects","Mapping Results","Direct Function","Direct Mapping","News Articles","Topic Modeling","Voronoi Diagram","Voronoi Tessellation","Voronoi Cell","Distinct Parts","Common Part","Large Graphs","Common Node","US Presidential Election","United States Presidential Election","Overview Of Themes","Overview Of Topics","Overview Of The Subject","Multiple Graphs","Pairwise Matching","Incremental Algorithm","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Multiple Matches","Different Levels Of Granularity","Node Mapping","Lymph Node Mapping","Subject Of Interest","Topics Of Interest","Common Ones","Precision And Recall"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6227-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2014.7042496","title":"PEARL: An interactive visual analytic tool for understanding personal emotion style derived from social media","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4799-6227-3","rank":89,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Toronto","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38024987300","id":38024987300,"full_name":"Jian Zhao","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Toronto"]}},{"affiliation":"IBM Research, Almaden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37075500200","id":37075500200,"full_name":"Liang Gou","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IBM Research, Almaden"]}},{"affiliation":"IBM Research, Almaden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38276538300","id":38276538300,"full_name":"Fei Wang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IBM Research, Almaden"]}},{"affiliation":"IBM Research, Almaden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399569300","id":37399569300,"full_name":"Michelle Zhou","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IBM Research, Almaden"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Hundreds of millions of people leave digital footprints on social media (e.g., Twitter and Facebook). Such data not only disclose a person's demographics and opinions, but also reveal one's emotional style. Emotional style captures a person's patterns of emotions over time, including his overall emotional volatility and resilience. Understanding one's emotional style can provide great benefits for both individuals and businesses alike, including the support of self-reflection and delivery of individualized customer care. We present PEARL, a timeline-based visual analytic tool that allows users to interactively discover and examine a person's emotional style derived from this person's social media text. Compared to other visual text analytic systems, our work offers three unique contributions. First, it supports multi-dimensional emotion analysis from social media text to automatically detect a person's expressed emotions at different time points and summarize those emotions to reveal the person's emotional style. Second, it effectively visualizes complex, multi-dimensional emotion analysis results to create a visual emotional profile of an individual, which helps users browse and interpret one's emotional style. Third, it supports rich visual interactions that allow users to interactively explore and validate emotion analysis results. We have evaluated our work extensively through a series of studies. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool both in emotion analysis from social media and in support of interactive visualization of the emotion analysis results.","article_number":"7042496","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042496","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042496/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042496/","publication_title":"2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Paris, France","conference_dates":"25-31 Oct. 2014","publication_number":7027279,"is_number":7042473,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"25-31 Oct. 2014","start_page":"203","end_page":"212","citing_paper_count":52,"citing_patent_count":8,"download_count":1436,"insert_date":"20150216","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Mood","Visualization","Media","Engines","Analytical models","Resilience","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Personal emotion analytics","affective and mood modeling","social media text","Twitter","information visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Social Media","Social Platforms","Interactive Visualization","Personal Emotions","Emotional Style","Multidimensional Data","Multidimensional Analysis","Psychological Resilience","Stress Resilience","Emotional Resilience","Mental Resilience","Digital Tracing","Digital Footprints","Rich Interactions","Emotional Patterns","Social Media Text","Emotional Profile","Real-time Analysis","Multiple Perspectives","Categorical Model","Emotional Components","Sentiment Analysis","Sentiment Classification","Original Text","Discrete Categories","Discrete Classes","Emotion Categories","Emotion Classification","Basic Emotions","Emotion Words","Individual Tweets","Emotional Episodes","Primary Emotions","Relevant Tweets","Visual Metaphors","Different Types Of Emotions","Lexicon-based Approach","Dictionary-based Approach","Emotion Type"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6227-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2014.7042480","title":"Feedback-driven interactive exploration of large multidimensional data supported by visual classifier","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4799-6227-3","rank":90,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Universität Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38551542600","id":38551542600,"full_name":"Michael Behrisch","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universität Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Universität Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077498900","id":37077498900,"full_name":"Fatih Korkmaz","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universität Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Universität Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085541736","id":37085541736,"full_name":"Lin Shao","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universität Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Universität Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282557600","id":37282557600,"full_name":"Tobias Schreck","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universität Konstanz, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"The extraction of relevant and meaningful information from multivariate or high-dimensional data is a challenging problem. One reason for this is that the number of possible representations, which might contain relevant information, grows exponentially with the amount of data dimensions. Also, not all views from a possibly large view space, are potentially relevant to a given analysis task or user. Focus+Context or Semantic Zoom Interfaces can help to some extent to efficiently search for interesting views or data segments, yet they show scalability problems for very large data sets. Accordingly, users are confronted with the problem of identifying interesting views, yet the manual exploration of the entire view space becomes ineffective or even infeasible. While certain quality metrics have been proposed recently to identify potentially interesting views, these often are defined in a heuristic way and do not take into account the application or user context. We introduce a framework for a feedback-driven view exploration, inspired by relevance feedback approaches used in Information Retrieval. Our basic idea is that users iteratively express their notion of interestingness when presented with candidate views. From that expression, a model representing the user's preferences, is trained and used to recommend further interesting view candidates. A decision support system monitors the exploration process and assesses the relevance-driven search process for convergence and stability. We present an instantiation of our framework for exploration of Scatter Plot Spaces based on visual features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this implementation by a case study on two real-world datasets. We also discuss our framework in light of design alternatives and point out its usefulness for development of user- and context-dependent visual exploration systems.","article_number":"7042480","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042480","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042480/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042480/","publication_title":"2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Paris, France","conference_dates":"25-31 Oct. 2014","publication_number":7027279,"is_number":7042473,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"25-31 Oct. 2014","start_page":"43","end_page":"52","citing_paper_count":49,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":986,"insert_date":"20150216","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Space exploration","Decision trees","Visualization","Vectors","Decision support systems","Data models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["View Space Exploration Framework","Interesting View Problem","Relevance Feedback","User Preference Model"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive","Scatter Plot","Decision Support","Decision Support System","Decision System","Information Retrieval","Real-world Datasets","Alternative Designs","Alternative Names","User Preferences","Exploration Process","Explanatory Framework","Relevant Feedback","Sampling Method","Decision Tree","Descriptive Characteristics","Feature Descriptors","Case Example","Need For Information","Interesting Problem","Relevant Examples","Image Retrieval","Image Search","Classification Applications","Sampling-based Approach","Exploration Path","User Decisions","User Decision-making","Parallel Coordinates","Irrelevant Items","User Feedback","User Selection","Wrong Decisions","Classification Uncertainty","Current Decision"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6227-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2014.7042492","title":"Multi-model semantic interaction for text analytics","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4799-6227-3","rank":91,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37071531400","id":37071531400,"full_name":"Lauren Bradel","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virginia Tech"]}},{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37419565900","id":37419565900,"full_name":"Chris North","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virginia Tech"]}},{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38241765600","id":38241765600,"full_name":"Leanna House","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virginia Tech"]}},{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38236156800","id":38236156800,"full_name":"Scotland Leman","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virginia Tech"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Semantic interaction offers an intuitive communication mechanism between human users and complex statistical models. By shielding the users from manipulating model parameters, they focus instead on directly manipulating the spatialization, thus remaining in their cognitive zone. However, this technique is not inherently scalable past hundreds of text documents. To remedy this, we present the concept of multi-model semantic interaction, where semantic interactions can be used to steer multiple models at multiple levels of data scale, enabling users to tackle larger data problems. We also present an updated visualization pipeline model for generalized multi-model semantic interaction. To demonstrate multi-model semantic interaction, we introduce StarSPIRE, a visual text analytics prototype that transforms user interactions on documents into both small-scale display layout updates as well as large-scale relevancy-based document selection.","article_number":"7042492","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042492","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042492/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042492/","publication_title":"2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Paris, France","conference_dates":"25-31 Oct. 2014","publication_number":7027279,"is_number":7042473,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"25-31 Oct. 2014","start_page":"163","end_page":"172","citing_paper_count":47,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":666,"insert_date":"20150216","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Semantics","Data models","Layout","Data visualization","Pipelines","Analytical models","Visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Semantic Interaction","Sensemaking","Text Analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Semantic Interaction","Visual Analysis","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Scale Level","Dimensionality Reduction","Entire Dataset","Workspace","Spatial Model","Weight Vector","Visual Feedback","Video Feedback","Information Retrieval","Understanding Of Use","Understanding Of Users","Understanding Of The Data","Unstructured Data","Unstructured Information","Spatial Layout","User Interest","Unstructured Text","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Relevant Feedback","Unstructured Text Data","Spatial Metaphors","Visual Encoding","Exotic Animals","Dataset In Order","Data Sets In Order","Order Interactions","Irrelevant Data","Large Datasets","Foraging Activity","Retrieval Algorithm"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6227-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2014.7042495","title":"Integrating predictive analytics and social media","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4799-6227-3","rank":92,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Arizona State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085342409","id":37085342409,"full_name":"Yafeng Lu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077786200","id":37077786200,"full_name":"Robert Krüger","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233559700","id":38233559700,"full_name":"Dennis Thom","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403438500","id":37403438500,"full_name":"Feng Wang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593029700","id":37593029700,"full_name":"Steffen Koch","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268023800","id":37268023800,"full_name":"Thomas Ertl","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396008400","id":37396008400,"full_name":"Ross Maciejewski","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"A key analytical task across many domains is model building and exploration for predictive analysis.

These systems need to integrate the human's natural expertise in analyzing multimedia with the machine's ability to process large-scale data. The paper starts off with a comprehensive overview of representation, learning, and interaction techniques from both the human's and the machine's point of view. To this end, hundreds of references from the related disciplines (visual analytics, information visualization, computer vision, multimedia information retrieval) have been surveyed. Based on the survey, a novel general multimedia analytics model is synthesized. In the model, the need for semantic navigation of the collection is emphasized and multimedia analytics tasks are placed on the exploration-search axis. The axis is composed of both exploration and search in a certain proportion which changes as the analyst progresses towards insight. Categorization is proposed as a suitable umbrella task realizing the exploration-search axis in the model. Finally, the pragmatic gap, defined as the difference between the tight machine categorization model and the flexible human categorization model is identified as a crucial multimedia analytics topic.","article_number":"7042476","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042476","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042476/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042476/","publication_title":"2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Paris, France","conference_dates":"25-31 Oct. 2014","publication_number":7027279,"is_number":7042473,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"25-31 Oct. 2014","start_page":"3","end_page":"12","citing_paper_count":29,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":859,"insert_date":"20150216","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Multimedia communication","Semantics","Visualization","Browsers","Streaming media","Data visualization","Feature extraction"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Multimedia (image/video/music) visualization","machine learning"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Flexible Model","Categorical Model","Interaction Techniques","Social Media","Social Platforms","Active Learning","Metadata","Convergence Rate","Convergence Speed","Large Collection","Visualization Techniques","Machine Model","Visual Content","Scale-invariant Feature Transform","Interface Analysis","Multimedia Content","Side Panel","Zero-shot","Zero-shot Learning","Semantic Gap","Text Annotation","Multimedia Data","Screen Space","Semantic Search","Semantic Extraction","High-level Object","Higher-level Objectives","Relevant Feedback","Mathematical Representation","Visual Domain","Bag Of Visual Words","Interactive Learning","Heterogeneous Data Sources"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6227-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2014.7042484","title":"Analyzing High-dimensional Multivariate Network Links with Integrated Anomaly Detection, Highlighting and Exploration","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4799-6227-3","rank":96,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37853300200","id":37853300200,"full_name":"Sungahnn Ko","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601862300","id":37601862300,"full_name":"Shehzad Afzal","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University"]}},{"affiliation":"Oxford University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085549160","id":37085549160,"full_name":"Simon Walton","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oxford University"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085560666","id":37085560666,"full_name":"Yang Yang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085564725","id":37085564725,"full_name":"Junghoon Chae","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37397435000","id":37397435000,"full_name":"Abish Malik","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University"]}},{"affiliation":"Sejong University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37557344300","id":37557344300,"full_name":"Yun Jang","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Sejong University"]}},{"affiliation":"Oxford University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37280982800","id":37280982800,"full_name":"Min Chen","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oxford University"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282598900","id":37282598900,"full_name":"David Ebert","author_order":9,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"This paper focuses on the integration of a family of visual analytics techniques for analyzing high-dimensional, multivariate network data that features spatial and temporal information, network connections, and a variety of other categorical and numerical data types.

The method is well suited for studying visual analytics applications in which users perform both targeted data searches and analyses of broader patterns. In such applications, an effective visualization design is one that helps users complete tasks accurately and efficiently, and supports hypothesis generation during open-ended exploration. To evaluate both of these aims in a single study, we developed an approach called layered insight- and task-based evaluation (LITE) that interposes several prompts for observations about the data model between sequences of predefined search tasks. We demonstrate the evaluation method in a user study of four network visualizations for spatiotemporal data in a visual analytics application. Results include findings that might have been difficult to obtain in a single experiment using a different methodology. For example, with one dataset we studied, we found that on average participants were faster on search tasks using a force-directed layout than using our other designs; at the same time, participants found this design least helpful in understanding the data. Our contributions include a novel evaluation method that combines well-defined tasks with exploration and observation, an evaluation of network visualization designs for spatiotemporal visual analytics, and guidelines for using this evaluation method.","article_number":"7042482","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042482","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042482/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042482/","publication_title":"2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Paris, France","conference_dates":"25-31 Oct. 2014","publication_number":7027279,"is_number":7042473,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"25-31 Oct. 2014","start_page":"63","end_page":"72","citing_paper_count":19,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":485,"insert_date":"20150216","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visual analytics","Data models","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Layout","Accuracy"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Evaluation methodology","insight-based evaluation","visual analytics","network visualization","information visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Data Model","Study Methods","Single Study","Evaluation Method","Rate Method","Visual System","Visual Network","Network Diagram","Search Task","Spatiotemporal Data","Visual Design","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Spatiotemporal Network","Usability","Ease Of Use","Response Time","Task Performance","Scoring System","Small Datasets","Dataset Size","Types Of Tasks","Subjective Ratings","Task Blocks","Visual Conditions","Visual Status","Think-aloud Protocols","Domain Experts","Incorrect Answers","Greenhouse-Geisser Correction","Mean Response Time","Benchmark Tasks","Subjective Feedback","Response Time Analysis"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6227-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2014.7042483","title":"Weaving a carpet from log entries: A network security visualization built with co-creation","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4799-6227-3","rank":99,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Design, The University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37706669700","id":37706669700,"full_name":"Johannes Landstorfer","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Design, The University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Design, The University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085494402","id":37085494402,"full_name":"Ivo Herrmann","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Design, The University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Design, The University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085494381","id":37085494381,"full_name":"Jan-Erik Stange","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Design, The University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Design, The University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590950400","id":37590950400,"full_name":"Marian Dörk","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Design, The University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Design, The University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37671134300","id":37671134300,"full_name":"Reto Wettach","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Design, The University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"We created a pixel map for multivariate data based on an analysis of the needs of network security engineers.

In this paper we focus on the reconstruction of meshes from point clouds, which are sets of points in 3D. Several algorithms that tackle this task already exist, but they have different benefits and drawbacks, which leads to a large number of possible reconstruction results (i.e., meshes). The evaluation of those techniques requires extensive comparisons between different meshes which is up to now done by either placing images of rendered meshes side-by-side, or by encoding differences by heat maps. A major drawback of both approaches is that they do not scale well with the number of meshes. This paper introduces a new comparative visual analysis technique for 3D meshes which enables the simultaneous comparison of several meshes and allows for the interactive exploration of their differences. Our approach gives an overview of the differences of the input meshes in a 2D view. By selecting certain areas of interest, the user can switch to a 3D representation and explore the spatial differences in detail. To inspect local variations, we provide a magic lens tool in 3D. The location and size of the lens provide further information on the variations of the reconstructions in the selected area. With our comparative visualization approach, differences between several mesh reconstruction algorithms can be easily localized and inspected.","article_number":"7042491","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042491","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042491/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042491/","publication_title":"2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Paris, France","conference_dates":"25-31 Oct. 2014","publication_number":7027279,"is_number":7042473,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"25-31 Oct. 2014","start_page":"153","end_page":"162","citing_paper_count":13,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":375,"insert_date":"20150216","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three-dimensional displays","Lenses","Context","Surface reconstruction","Reconstruction algorithms","Kernel"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual analysis","comparative visualization","3D data exploration","focus+context","mesh comparison"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Comparative Analysis","Comparison Analysis","Heatmap","Visual Analysis","Point Cloud","Reconstruction Algorithm","Visualization Techniques","3D Mesh","Surface Mesh","Reconstruction Results","Visual Approach","Differences In Data","Deviation Of Data","Current Position","Current Location","Domain Experts","Detailed View","Low Error Rate","Overview Of Data","Surface Reconstruction","Calculation Of Variables","Computation Of Variables","Variation Map","Point Cloud Data","Global Error","Parallel Coordinates","Overview Images","Behavior Of Algorithm","Behaviour Of The Algorithm","Point Cloud Reconstruction","Reconstructed Point Clouds","Point Cloud Dataset","Comparison Task","Benchmarking Tool","Interaction Techniques","Problematic Regions","Interactive Tool"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6227-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2014.7042490","title":"BoundarySeer: Visual analysis of 2D boundary changes","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4799-6227-3","rank":102,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085419783","id":37085419783,"full_name":"Wenchao Wu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085403277","id":37085403277,"full_name":"Yixian Zheng","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37291847800","id":37291847800,"full_name":"Wei Chen","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, VRVis Research Center, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284271200","id":37284271200,"full_name":"Eduard Gröller","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, VRVis Research Center, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273314400","id":37273314400,"full_name":"Lionel M.

From the Antarctic ozone hole to the land desertification, and from the territory of a country to the area within one-hour reach from a downtown location, boundaries change over time. With a large number of time-varying boundaries recorded, people often need to analyze the changes, detect their similarities or differences, and find out spatial and temporal patterns of the evolution for various applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive visual analytics system, BoundarySeer, to help users gain insight into the changes of boundaries. Our system consists of four major viewers: 1) a global viewer to show boundary groups based on their similarity and the distribution of boundary attributes such as smoothness and perimeter; 2) a region viewer to display the regions encircled by the boundaries and how they are affected by boundary changes; 3) a trend viewer to reveal the temporal patterns in the boundary evolution and potential spatio-temporal correlations; 4) a directional change viewer to encode movements of boundary segments in different directions. Quantitative analyses of boundaries (e.g., similarity measurement and adaptive clustering) and intuitive visualizations (e.g., density map and ThemeRiver) are integrated into these viewers, which enable users to explore boundary changes from different aspects and at different scales.

They consist of sequences of amino acids. An interaction with reactive agent can stimulate a mutation at a specific position in the sequence. This mutation may set off a chain reaction, which effects other amino acids in the protein. Chain reactions need to be analyzed, as they may invoke unwanted side effects in drug treatment. A mutation chain is represented by a directed acyclic graph, where amino acids are connected by their mutation dependencies. As each amino acid may mutate individually, many mutation graphs exist. To determine important impacts of mutations, experts need to analyze and compare common patterns in these mutations graphs. Experts, however, lack suitable tools for this purpose. We present a new system for the search and the exploration of frequent patterns (i.e., motifs) in mutation graphs. We present a fast pattern search algorithm specifically developed for finding biologically relevant patterns in many mutation graphs (i.e., many labeled acyclic directed graphs). Our visualization system allows an interactive exploration and comparison of the found patterns. It enables locating the found patterns in the mutation graphs and in the 3D protein structures. In this way, potentially interesting patterns can be discovered. These patterns serve as starting point for a further biological analysis. In cooperation with biologists, we use our approach for analyzing a real world data set based on multiple HIV protease sequences.","article_number":"7042485","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042485","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042485/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042485/","publication_title":"2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Paris, France","conference_dates":"25-31 Oct. 2014","publication_number":7027279,"is_number":7042473,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"25-31 Oct. 2014","start_page":"93","end_page":"102","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":318,"insert_date":"20150216","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Amino acids","Visualization","Proteins","Drugs","Three-dimensional displays","Algorithm design and analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Biologic Visualization","Graph Visualization","Motif Search","Motif Visualization","Biology","Mutations","Pattern Visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Pattern Analysis","Multiple Mutations","Multiple Graphs","Graph Pattern","Biologists","Real-world Data","Interesting Patterns","Pattern Of Involvement","Protein Acid","Frequent Pattern","Exploration Of Patterns","3D Protein Structure","Directed Acyclic Graph","Pattern Search","HIV Protease","3D Structure","Complex Patterns","Interfacial Interaction","Visual Comparison","Root Node","Parent Node","Number Of Patterns","Patterns In Set","Detailed View","Network Patterns","Basic Patterns","Mutation Patterns","Network Propagation","Population Bottlenecks","Bottleneck Effect","Bottleneck Events","Genetic Bottleneck","Target Amino Acid","Set Of Graphs"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6227-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2014.7042481","title":"An integrated visual analysis system for fusing MR spectroscopy and multi-modal radiology imaging","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4799-6227-3","rank":105,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085586373","id":37085586373,"full_name":"Miguel Nunes","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Institut Claudius Regaud, Toulouse, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37075302800","id":37075302800,"full_name":"Benjamin Rowland","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institut Claudius Regaud, Toulouse, France"]}},{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37976622700","id":37976622700,"full_name":"Matthias Schlachter","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Institut Claudius Regaud, Toulouse, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37075211700","id":37075211700,"full_name":"Soléakhéna Ken","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institut Claudius Regaud, Toulouse, France"]}},{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37947312900","id":37947312900,"full_name":"Kresimir Matkovic","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Institut Claudius Regaud, Toulouse, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37075400700","id":37075400700,"full_name":"Anne Laprie","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institut Claudius Regaud, Toulouse, France"]}},{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267821300","id":37267821300,"full_name":"Katja Bühler","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"For cancers such as glioblastoma multiforme, there is an increasing interest in defining \"biological target volumes\" (BTV), high tumour-burden regions which may be targeted with dose boosts in radiotherapy. The definition of a BTV requires insight into tumour characteristics going beyond conventionally defined radiological abnormalities and anatomical features. Molecular and biochemical imaging techniques, like positron emission tomography, the use of Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging contrast agents or MR Spectroscopy deliver this information and support BTV delineation. MR Spectroscopy Imaging (MRSI) is the only non-invasive technique in this list. Studies with MRSI have shown that voxels with certain metabolic signatures are more susceptible to predict the site of relapse. Nevertheless, the discovery of complex relationships between a high number of different metabolites, anatomical, molecular and functional features is an ongoing topic of research - still lacking appropriate tools supporting a smooth workflow by providing data integration and fusion of MRSI data with other imaging modalities. We present a solution bridging this gap which gives fast and flexible access to all data at once. By integrating a customized visualization of the multi-modal and multi-variate image data with a highly flexible visual analytics (VA) framework, it is for the first time possible to interactively fuse, visualize and explore user defined metabolite relations derived from MRSI in combination with markers delivered by other imaging modalities. Real-world medical cases demonstrate the utility of our solution. By making MRSI data available both in a VA tool and in a multi-modal visualization renderer we can combine insights from each side to arrive at a superior BTV delineation. We also report feedback from domain experts indicating significant positive impact in how this work can improve the understanding of MRSI data and its integration into radiotherapy planning.","article_number":"7042481","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042481","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042481/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042481/","publication_title":"2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Paris, France","conference_dates":"25-31 Oct. 2014","publication_number":7027279,"is_number":7042473,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"25-31 Oct. 2014","start_page":"53","end_page":"62","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":273,"insert_date":"20150216","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Biomedical imaging","Tumors","Brushes","Planning","Spectroscopy"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["MR spectroscopy","cancer","brain","visualization","multi-modality data","radiotherapy planning","medical decision support systems"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Medical Imaging","Clinical Imaging","Diagnostic Imaging","Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy","MR Spectroscopy","Imaging Spectroscopy","Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging","MR Spectroscopic Imaging","Visual Analytics System","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Relapse","Imaging Modalities","Contrast Agent","Contrast Enhancement","Contrast Medium","Multivariate Data","Multivariate Statistics","Anatomical Features","Anatomical Characteristics","Molecular Imaging","Glioblastoma Multiforme","Data Fusion","Understanding Of The Data","Visual Analytics Tool","Tumor Tissues","Treatment Plan","Data Visualization","Healthy Tissue","Anatomical Images","Radiation Treatment Planning","Radiotherapy Treatment Planning","Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning","Parallel Coordinates","Expert Users","Fluid-attenuated Inversion Recovery","FLAIR","Metabolite Ratios","Medical Data","Metabolic Ratio","Function Of Ratio","Mapping Ratio","Data Storage System"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6227-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2014.7042536","title":"VAST challenge 2014: The Kronos incident","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4799-6227-3","rank":106,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37357067600","id":37357067600,"full_name":"Mark Whiting","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085505404","id":37085505404,"full_name":"Kristin Cook","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Massachusetts Lowell","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37360588500","id":37360588500,"full_name":"Georges Grinstein","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Massachusetts Lowell"]}},{"affiliation":"Air Force Research Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085508309","id":37085508309,"full_name":"Kristen Liggett","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Air Force Research Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085518782","id":37085518782,"full_name":"Michael Cooper","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Massachusetts Lowell","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085522319","id":37085522319,"full_name":"John Fallon","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Massachusetts Lowell"]}},{"affiliation":"Battelle","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085518602","id":37085518602,"full_name":"Marc Morin","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Battelle"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"The 2014 IEEE Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST) Challenge presented researchers with a single fictitious scenario: the disappearance of staff members of the GASTech oil and gas company on location on the island of Kronos.

One challenge to the data analysis task is that there are far too many signals for analysts to go through by hand. Even typical signal meta data (such as frequency band, duration, and geographic location) can be overwhelming. In this paper, we present a system for exploring and analyzing such radio signal meta-data. Our system incorporates several visual representations for signal data, designed for readability and ease of comparison, as well as novel algorithms for extracting and classifying consistent signal patterns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system using data collected from real missions with an airborne sensor platform.","article_number":"7042479","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042479","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042479/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042479/","publication_title":"2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Paris, France","conference_dates":"25-31 Oct. 2014","publication_number":7027279,"is_number":7042473,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"25-31 Oct. 2014","start_page":"33","end_page":"42","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":2,"download_count":309,"insert_date":"20150216","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Repeaters","Data visualization","Geospatial analysis","Time-frequency analysis","Wavelet analysis","Visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Intelligence Analysis","Coordinated and Multiple Views","Time-varying data","Geographic/Geospatial Visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Radio Waves","Wireless Signal","Radio Signals","Radio Emission","Frequency Band","Visual Representation","Time Window","Start Time","Variable Duration","Digital Signal","Color Map","Repetitive Patterns","Repeated Patterns","Points In Region","Combination Of Algorithms","Analog Signal","Parallel Signaling","Similar Signatures","Signal Duration","Expert Users","Pair Of Signals","Digital Algorithm","Signals Intelligence","SIGINT","Map View","Digital Pattern","Main View","Digital Transmission","Workflow","Visual Metaphors","Goal In Mind","Series Of Events","Series Of Effects","Flight Test","Digital Communication","Data Communication","Digital Citizenship","Time Series"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6227-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2014.7042475","title":"Supporters & exhibitors","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4799-6227-3","rank":108,"authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"The conference organizers greatly appreciate the support of the various corporate sponsors listed.","article_number":"7042475","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042475","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042475/","publication_title":"2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Paris, France","conference_dates":"25-31 Oct. 2014","publication_number":7027279,"is_number":7042473,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"25-31 Oct. 2014","start_page":"1","end_page":"1","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":57,"insert_date":"20150216","index_terms":{},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6227-3","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2014.7042474","title":"[Front matter]","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4799-6227-3","rank":109,"authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Conference proceedings front matter may contain various advertisements, welcome messages, committee or program information, and other miscellaneous conference information.
