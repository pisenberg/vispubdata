The authors report on development and use of one component of a prototype GVis environment designed to facilitate exploration, by domain experts, of time series multivariate georeferenced health statistics. Emphasis is on how manipulable dynamic GVis tools may facilitate visual thinking, pattern noticing, and hypothesis generation. The prototype facilitates the highlighting of data extremes, examination of change in geographic patterns over time, and exploration of similarity among georeferenced variables. A qualitative exploratory analysis of verbal protocols and transaction logs is used to characterize system use. Evidence produced through the characterization highlights differences among experts in data analysis strategies (particularly in relation to the use of attribute \"focusing\" combined with time series animation) and corresponding differences in success at noticing spatiotemporal patterns.","article_number":"729563","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=729563","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/729563/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/729563/","publication_title":"Proceedings IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization (Cat.

We describe a systematic approach to arrange the dimensions according to their similarity. The basic idea is to rearrange the data dimensions such that dimensions showing a similar behavior are positioned next to each other. For the similarity clustering of dimensions, we need to define similarity measures which determine the partial or global similarity of dimensions. We then consider the problem of finding an optimal one- or two-dimensional arrangement of the dimensions based on their similarity. Theoretical considerations show that both, the one- and the two-dimensional arrangement problem are surprisingly hard problems, i.e. they are NP complete. Our solution of the problem is therefore based on heuristic algorithms. An empirical evaluation using a number of different visualization techniques shows the high impact of our similarity clustering of dimensions on the visualization results.","article_number":"729559","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=729559","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/729559/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/729559/","publication_title":"Proceedings IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization (Cat.

While free-form text is a rich, common source of information, visualization of text is a challenging problem since text is inherently non-spatial. The paper explores the use of implicit surface models for visualizing text. The authors describe several techniques for text visualization that aid in understanding document content and document relationships. A simple method is defined for mapping document content to shape. By comparing the shapes of multiple documents, global content similarities and differences may be noted. In addition, they describe a visual clustering method in which documents are arranged in 3D based upon similarity scoring. Documents deemed closely related blend together as a single connected shape. Hence, a document corpus becomes a collection of shapes that reflect inter-document relationships. These techniques provide methods to visualize individual documents as well as corpus meta-data. They then combine the two techniques to produce transparent clusters enclosing individual document shapes. This provides a way to visualize both local and global contextual information. Finally, they elaborate on several potential applications of these methods.","article_number":"729568","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=729568","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/729568/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/729568/","publication_title":"Proceedings IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization (Cat.

In RDT, each node is associated with a disc, around which its children are placed. Using discs instead of cones as the basic shape in RDT has several advantages: significant reduction of occluded region, sharp increase in number of displayed nodes, and easy projection onto plane without visual overlapping. We show that RDT can greatly enhance user perception by transforming its shapes dynamically in several ways: (1) disc tree which can significantly reduce the occluded region by the foreground objects; (2) compact disc tree which can increase the number of nodes displayed on the screen; and (3) plane disc tree which can be mapped onto the plane without visual overlapping. We describe an implementation of our visualization system called VISIT (Visual Information System for reconfigurable dIsc tree). It provides 2D and 3D layouts for RDT and various user interface features such as tree reconfiguration, tree transformation, tree shading, viewing transformation, animation, selection and browsing which can enhance the user perception and navigation capabilities. We also evaluate our system using the following three metrics: percentage of occlusion, density of displayed nodes on a screen, and number of identifiable nodes.","article_number":"729555","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=729555","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/729555/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/729555/","publication_title":"Proceedings IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization (Cat.

While algorithm animations typically rely on user augmented source code to produce visualizations, debuggers make use of symbolic information in the target program. As a result, visualizations produced by debuggers often lack important semantic content, making them inferior to algorithm animation systems. The paper presents a method to provide higher level, more informative visualizations in a debugger using a technique called traversal based visualization. The debugger traverses a data structure using a set of user supplied patterns to identify parts of the data structure to be drawn a similar way. A declarative language is used to specify the patterns and the actions to take when the patterns are encountered. Alternatively, the user can construct traversal specifications through a graphical user interface to the declarative language. Furthermore, the debugger supports modification of data. Changes made to the on-screen representation are reflected in the underlying data.","article_number":"729554","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=729554","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/729554/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/729554/","publication_title":"Proceedings IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization (Cat.

Fold predictions are low resolution; no effort is made to rotate the protein's component amino acid side chains into their correct spatial orientations. Rather, the goal is to recognize the protein family member that most closely resembles the target sequence of unknown structure and to create a sensible alignment of the target to the structure (i.e., a structure-sequence alignment). To complement this structure prediction method the authors have implemented a low resolution molecular graphics tool. Since amino acid side chain orientation is not relevant in fold recognition, amino acid residues are represented by abstract shapes or glyphs much like Lego/sup TM/ blocks. They also borrow techniques from comparative streamline visualization to provide clean depictions of the entire protein structure model. By creating a low resolution representation of protein structure, they are able to approximately double the amount of information on the screen. This implementation also possesses the advantage of eliminating distracting and possibly misleading visual clutter resulting from the mapping of protein alignment information onto a high resolution display of a known structure.","article_number":"729566","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=729566","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/729566/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/729566/","publication_title":"Proceedings IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization (Cat.
