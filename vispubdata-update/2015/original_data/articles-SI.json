These decisions often involve both domain and visualization design expertise, and may impose a tedious specification process that impedes exploration. In this paper, we seek to complement manual chart construction with interactive navigation of a gallery of automatically-generated visualizations. We contribute Voyager, a mixed-initiative system that supports faceted browsing of recommended charts chosen according to statistical and perceptual measures. We describe Voyager's architecture, motivating design principles, and methods for generating and interacting with visualization recommendations. In a study comparing Voyager to a manual visualization specification tool, we find that Voyager facilitates exploration of previously unseen data and leads to increased data variable coverage. We then distill design implications for visualization tools, in particular the need to balance rapid exploration and targeted question-answering.","article_number":"7192728","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192728","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192728/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192728/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"649","end_page":"658","citing_paper_count":264,"citing_patent_count":6,"download_count":3960,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Encoding","Visualization","Grammar","Image color analysis","Compass","Browsers"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["User interfaces","information visualization","exploratory analysis","visualization recommendation","mixed-initiative systems","User interfaces","information visualization","exploratory analysis","visualization recommendation","mixed-initiative systems"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Exploratory Analysis","Exploratory Data Analysis","Faceted Search","Faceted Navigation","Faceted Browsing","Visualization Recommendation","Statistical Measures","Visualization Tool","Question Answering","Visual Design","Visual Encoding","Rapid Exploration","Variance In The Data","Compassion","Ordinal Scale","Ordinal Variables","Ordinal Data","Stage Of Analysis","Exploratory Data","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Data Transformation","Perceptual Effects","Variance In The Dataset","Nominal Variables","Nominal Scale","Recommender Systems","User Selection","Bookmarking","Exploratory Search","Visual Channels","Exhaustive Enumeration","Exit Survey","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Scrolling","Sort Order","User Study"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467732","title":"Beyond Memorability: Visualization Recognition and Recall","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":2,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of British Columbia, Harvard University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017334100","id":38017334100,"full_name":"Michelle A.

Our findings quantitatively support many conventional qualitative design guidelines, including that (1) titles and supporting text should convey the message of a visualization, (2) if used appropriately, pictograms do not interfere with understanding and can improve recognition, and (3) redundancy helps effectively communicate the message. Importantly, we show that visualizations memorable “at-a-glance” are also capable of effectively conveying the message of the visualization. Thus, a memorable visualization is often also an effective one.","article_number":"7192646","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192646","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192646/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192646/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"519","end_page":"528","citing_paper_count":177,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":5130,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Redundancy","Encoding","Target recognition","Atmospheric measurements","Particle measurements"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Information visualization","memorability","recognition","recall","eye-tracking study","Information visualization","memorability","recognition","recall","eye-tracking study"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Eye Movements","Design Guidelines","Textual Descriptions","Pictograms","Pictographs","Attention Of People","Qualitative Guidelines","Conventional Guidelines","Supplemental Material","Recognizable","Experimental Phase","Infographic","Graphical Display","Redundant Data","Visual Elements","Fixation Duration","Semantic Associations","Public Venues","Textual Elements","Source Categories","Recognition Phase","Scientific Visualization","Type Of Visualization","Bottom Third","Fixation Patterns","Encoding Time","Portion Of The Experiment","Recall Phase","Government Sources","Graphical Elements","Detailed Visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467091","title":"Reactive Vega: A Streaming Dataflow Architecture for Declarative Interactive Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":3,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Stanford University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085729682","id":37085729682,"full_name":"Arvind Satyanarayan","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Stanford University"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085728576","id":37085728576,"full_name":"Ryan Russell","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Washington"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085728980","id":37085728980,"full_name":"Jane Hoffswell","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Washington"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550791300","id":37550791300,"full_name":"Jeffrey Heer","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Washington"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present Reactive Vega, a system architecture that provides the first robust and comprehensive treatment of declarative visual and interaction design for data visualization.

Evidence is collected, collated and cross-linked with our existing knowledge. In the process, a myriad of analytical and visualisation techniques are employed to generate a visual representation of the data. These often introduce their own uncertainties, in addition to the ones inherent in the data, and these propagated and compounded uncertainties can result in impaired decision making. The user's confidence or trust in the results depends on the extent of user's awareness of the underlying uncertainties generated on the system side. This paper unpacks the uncertainties that propagate through visual analytics systems, illustrates how human's perceptual and cognitive biases influence the user's awareness of such uncertainties, and how this affects the user's trust building. The knowledge generation model for visual analytics is used to provide a terminology and framework to discuss the consequences of these aspects in knowledge construction and though examples, machine uncertainty is compared to human trust measures with provenance. Furthermore, guidelines for the design of uncertainty-aware systems are presented that can aid the user in better decision making.","article_number":"7192716","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192716","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192716/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192716/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"240","end_page":"249","citing_paper_count":168,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":3845,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty","Data visualization","Visual analytics","Data models","Buildings","Analytical models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analytics","Knowledge Generation","Uncertainty Measures and Propagation","Trust Building","Human Factors","Visual Analytics","Knowledge Generation","Uncertainty Measures and Propagation","Trust Building","Human Factors"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Role Of Uncertainty","Visual System","General Knowledge","General Cognition","Cognitive Biases","Visualization Techniques","Building Trust","User Trust","User Awareness","Human Behavior","Visual Processing","Model Building","Expert Knowledge","Pieces Of Evidence","Model Uncertainty","Error Propagation","Cumulative Error","Uncertainty Propagation","System Usability","Mental Models","Social Media Data","Social Media Analytics","Decision Aid","Concept Of Consciousness","Concept Of Awareness","Visual Metaphors","Authoritative Data","Technical Competence","Side Of The Model","Uncertainty Information","Human Side","Trust In Systems","Kind Of Uncertainty","Confirmation Bias"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2468111","title":"MobilityGraphs: Visual Analysis of Mass Mobility Dynamics via Spatio-Temporal Graphs and Clustering","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":5,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586276100","id":37586276100,"full_name":"Tatiana von Landesberger","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085641233","id":37085641233,"full_name":"Felix Brodkorb","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085698863","id":37085698863,"full_name":"Philipp Roskosch","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer IAIS, City University, London, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047700","id":37283047700,"full_name":"Natalia Andrienko","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer IAIS, City University, London, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer IAIS, City University, London, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047100","id":37283047100,"full_name":"Gennady Andrienko","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer IAIS, City University, London, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer IAIS, City University, London, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282717800","id":37282717800,"full_name":"Andreas Kerren","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer IAIS, City University, London, UK"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Learning more about people mobility is an important task for official decision makers and urban planners. Mobility data sets characterize the variation of the presence of people in different places over time as well as movements (or flows) of people between the places. The analysis of mobility data is challenging due to the need to analyze and compare spatial situations (i.e., presence and flows of people at certain time moments) and to gain an understanding of the spatio-temporal changes (variations of situations over time). Traditional flow visualizations usually fail due to massive clutter. Modern approaches offer limited support for investigating the complex variation of the movements over longer time periods. We propose a visual analytics methodology that solves these issues by combined spatial and temporal simplifications. We have developed a graph-based method, called MobilityGraphs, which reveals movement patterns that were occluded in flow maps. Our method enables the visual representation of the spatio-temporal variation of movements for long time series of spatial situations originally containing a large number of intersecting flows. The interactive system supports data exploration from various perspectives and at various levels of detail by interactive setting of clustering parameters. The feasibility our approach was tested on aggregated mobility data derived from a set of geolocated Twitter posts within the Greater London city area and mobile phone call data records in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. We could show that MobilityGraphs support the identification of regular daily and weekly movement patterns of resident population.","article_number":"7192732","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192732","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192732/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192732/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"11","end_page":"20","citing_paper_count":156,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":4477,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Aggregates","Visualization","Clustering algorithms","Clutter","Geology","Twitter"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","movement data","networks","graphs","temporal aggregation","spatial aggregation","flows","clustering","Visual analytics","movement data","networks","graphs","temporal aggregation","spatial aggregation","flows","clustering"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive","Time Series","Movement Patterns","Exploratory Data","Moment In Time","Movement Variability","Geolocated","Ivory Coast","Presence Of People","Flow Map","Flow Visualization","Greater London","Time Step","Flow Data","Edge Weights","Spatial Clustering","Real-world Datasets","Type Of Movement","Morning Hours","Number Of Time Steps","Spatial Aggregation","Magnitude Of Flow","Dynamic Graph","Absolute Flow","Temporal Clustering","Simple Situation","Time-varying Data","Aggregator Node","Aggregate Flows","Flow Strength"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467551","title":"Characterizing Provenance in Visualization and Data Analysis: An Organizational Framework of Provenance Types and Purposes","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":6,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Texas A&M University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681364500","id":37681364500,"full_name":"Eric D.

A special graph is created to store and manifest real traffic information recorded by taxi trajectories over city streets. It conveys urban transportation dynamics which can be discovered by applying graph analysis algorithms. To support interactive, multiscale visual analytics, a graph partitioning algorithm is applied to create region-level graphs which have smaller size than the original street-level graph. Graph centralities, including Pagerank and betweenness, are computed to characterize the time-varying importance of different urban regions. The centralities are visualized by three coordinated views including a node-link graph view, a map view and a temporal information view. Users can interactively examine the importance of streets to discover and assess city traffic patterns. We have implemented a fully working prototype of this approach and evaluated it using massive taxi trajectories of Shenzhen, China. TrajGraph's capability in revealing the importance of city streets was evaluated by comparing the calculated centralities with the subjective evaluations from a group of drivers in Shenzhen. Feedback from a domain expert was collected. The effectiveness of the visual interface was evaluated through a formal user study. We also present several examples and a case study to demonstrate the usefulness of TrajGraph in urban transportation analysis.","article_number":"7192687","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192687","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192687/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192687/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"160","end_page":"169","citing_paper_count":131,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":3596,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Urban areas","Public transportation","Roads","Trajectory","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Graph based visual analytics","Centrality","Taxi trajectories","Urban network","Transportation assessment","Graph based visual analytics","Centrality","Taxi trajectories","Urban network","Transportation assessment"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Urban Network","Traffic Network","Trajectory Data","Taxi Trajectory","Visual Analytics Approach","Taxi Trajectory Data","User Study","Graphical Analysis","Graphon","Domain Experts","Real Information","Urban Transport","City Streets","City Road","Urban Patterns","Traffic Patterns","Graph Partitioning","Multilevel Techniques","Original Graph","Traffic Information","Visual Interface","Map View","Group Of Drivers","Betweenness Centrality","Visual Exploration","Interactive Exploration","Transport Patterns","Average Speed","Average Travel Time","Road Segments","Street Segments","Hub Regions","Traffic Flow","Vehicular Traffic","Traffic Speed","Temporal Changes"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467851","title":"Time Curves: Folding Time to Visualize Patterns of Temporal Evolution in Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":8,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research-Inria Joint Centre","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085687578","id":37085687578,"full_name":"Benjamin Bach","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research-Inria Joint Centre"]}},{"affiliation":"IBM T.J, Watson Research Center, Yorktown Height, NY","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38019494400","id":38019494400,"full_name":"Conglei Shi","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IBM T.J, Watson Research Center, Yorktown Height, NY"]}},{"affiliation":"IRT SystemX","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085432351","id":37085432351,"full_name":"Nicolas Heulot","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IRT SystemX"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Radiology, University of Washington","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37326425600","id":37326425600,"full_name":"Tara Madhyastha","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Radiology, University of Washington"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Radiology and Neurology, University of Washington","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38263758600","id":38263758600,"full_name":"Tom Grabowski","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Radiology and Neurology, University of Washington"]}},{"affiliation":"Inria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590932700","id":37590932700,"full_name":"Pierre Dragicevic","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Inria"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We introduce time curves as a general approach for visualizing patterns of evolution in temporal data.

The components of our approach are discretization, vectorization and normalization, dimensionality reduction, and visualization and interaction, which are discussed in detail.

Automated anomaly detection based on advanced machine learning techniques has been developed to combat this issue; challenges remain, though, due to the difficulty of obtaining proper ground truth for model training and evaluation. Therefore, substantial human judgment on the automated analysis results is often required to better adjust the performance of anomaly detection. Unfortunately, techniques that allow users to understand the analysis results more efficiently, to make a confident judgment about anomalies, and to explore data in their context, are still lacking. In this paper, we propose a novel visual analysis system, TargetVue, which detects anomalous users via an unsupervised learning model and visualizes the behaviors of suspicious users in behavior-rich context through novel visualization designs and multiple coordinated contextual views. Particularly, TargetVue incorporates three new ego-centric glyphs to visually summarize a user's behaviors which effectively present the user's communication activities, features, and social interactions. An efficient layout method is proposed to place these glyphs on a triangle grid, which captures similarities among users and facilitates comparisons of behaviors of different users. We demonstrate the power of TargetVue through its application in a social bot detection challenge using Twitter data, a case study based on email records, and an interview with expert users. Our evaluation shows that TargetVue is beneficial to the detection of users with anomalous communication behaviors.","article_number":"7185421","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7185421","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7185421/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7185421/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"280","end_page":"289","citing_paper_count":105,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2769,"insert_date":"20150811","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Twitter","Electronic mail","Feature extraction","Context","Data models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Anomaly Detection","Social Media","Visual Analysis","Anomaly Detection","Social Media","Visual Analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Online Communities","Online Discussion","Computer-mediated Communication","User Behavior","Anomalous Behavior","Anomalous User","Social Media","Social Platforms","Visual System","Social Media Platforms","Active Users","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Social Challenges","Communication Activities","Communication Behaviors","Communication Behaviours","Anomaly Detection","User Characteristics","User Features","Unsupervised Model","Twitter Data","Communication Features","Communication Characteristics","Visual Design","Expert Users","Anomaly Score","Global View","Social Objectives","Visual Comparison","Feature Space","Social Communication","Feature Categories","Categories Of Characteristics","Normal Users","Social Media Data","Social Media Analytics","Negative Sentiment"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2466992","title":"Evaluation of Parallel Coordinates: Overview, Categorization and Guidelines for Future Research","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":11,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Norrköping Visualization Center C/Linköping University, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273045500","id":37273045500,"full_name":"Jimmy Johansson","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Norrköping Visualization Center C/Linköping University, Sweden"]}},{"affiliation":"Norrköping Visualization Center C/Linköping University, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546939800","id":37546939800,"full_name":"Camilla Forsell","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Norrköping Visualization Center C/Linköping University, Sweden"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The parallel coordinates technique is widely used for the analysis of multivariate data. During recent decades significant research efforts have been devoted to exploring the applicability of the technique and to expand upon it, resulting in a variety of extensions.

The result is a clear lack of convincing evidence to support and guide uptake by users as well as future research directions. To address these issues this paper contributes a thorough literature survey of what has been done in the area of user-centred evaluation of parallel coordinates. These evaluations are divided into four categories based on characterization of use, derived from the survey. Based on the data from the survey and the categorization combined with the authors' experience of working with parallel coordinates, a set of guidelines for future research directions is

By providing both rich text and movement information, visual analysis on social media data can be both interesting and challenging. In contrast to traditional movement data, the sparseness and irregularity of social media data increase the difficulty of extracting movement patterns. To facilitate the understanding of people's movements, we present an interactive visual analytics system to support the exploration of sparsely sampled trajectory data from social media. We propose a heuristic model to reduce the uncertainty caused by the nature of social media data. In the proposed system, users can filter and select reliable data from each derived movement category, based on the guidance of uncertainty model and interactive selection tools. By iteratively analyzing filtered movements, users can explore the semantics of movements, including the transportation methods, frequent visiting sequences and keyword descriptions. We provide two cases to demonstrate how our system can help users to explore the movement patterns.","article_number":"7192688","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192688","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192688/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192688/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"270","end_page":"279","citing_paper_count":95,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2707,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Media","Semantics","Uncertainty","Transportation","Reliability","Data models","Data mining"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Spatial temporal visual analytics","Geo-tagged social media","Sparsely sampling","Uncertainty","Movement","Spatial temporal visual analytics","Geo-tagged social media","Sparsely sampling","Uncertainty","Movement"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Social Media","Social Platforms","Movement Patterns","Interactive Visualization","Social Media Data","Social Media Analytics","Sparse Sampling","Geo-tagged Social Media","Geo-tagged Social Media Data","Semantic","Visual Analysis","Model Uncertainty","Movement Of People","Understanding Of People","Transport Method","Time Interval","Histogram","Twitter","Retweets","Travel Time","Temporal Information","Visualization Tool","Frequent Pattern","Interval Distribution","Places Of Interest","Gaussian Mixture Model","Movement Analysis","Interactive Exploration","GPS Data","Sina Weibo","Chinese New Year","Chinese Lunar New Year","Flow Map","Weibo Users"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467757","title":"Visual Analysis and Dissemination of Scientific Literature Collections with SurVis","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":13,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"VISUS, University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586060300","id":37586060300,"full_name":"Fabian Beck","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VISUS, University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"VISUS, University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089918275","id":37089918275,"full_name":"Sebastian Koch","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VISUS, University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"VISUS, University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268045000","id":37268045000,"full_name":"Daniel Weiskopf","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VISUS, University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Bibliographic data such as collections of scientific articles and citation networks have been studied extensively in information visualization and visual analytics research. Powerful systems have been built to support various types of bibliographic analysis, but they require some training and cannot be used to disseminate the insights gained. In contrast, we focused on developing a more accessible visual analytics system, called SurVis, that is ready to disseminate a carefully surveyed literature collection. The authors of a survey may use our Web-based system to structure and analyze their literature database. Later, readers of the survey can obtain an overview, quickly retrieve specific publications, and reproduce or extend the original bibliographic analysis. Our system employs a set of selectors that enable users to filter and browse the literature collection as well as to control interactive visualizations. The versatile selector concept includes selectors for textual search, filtering by keywords and meta-information, selection and clustering of similar publications, and following citation links. Agreement to the selector is represented by word-sized sparkline visualizations seamlessly integrated into the user interface. Based on an analysis of the analytical reasoning process, we derived requirements for the system. We developed the system in a formative way involving other researchers writing literature surveys. A questionnaire study with 14 visual analytics experts confirms that SurVis meets the initially formulated requirements.","article_number":"7192633","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192633","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192633/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192633/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"180","end_page":"189","citing_paper_count":81,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":3622,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Browsers","Tag clouds","Libraries","Visualization","Cognition"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics of documents","bibliographic data","dissemination","literature browser","Visual analytics of documents","bibliographic data","dissemination","literature browser"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Literature Survey","Search String","Text Search","String Matching","System Requirements","Interactive Visualization","Web-based System","Reasoning Process","Citation Network","Bibliographic Analysis","Reference Lists","Literature Data","Interactive System","Digital Library","Virtual Library","Digital Repository","Online Library","Cloud Data","Word Cloud","Domain Experts","Types Of Users","Minimum Frequency","Visibility Graph","Visual Approach","Agreement Values","List Of Publications","Publication Title","Digital Object Identifier","Term Frequency-inverse Document Frequency","Inverse Document Frequency","TF-IDF","Part Of Diagram","Fulfillment Of Requirements","Text Field","Usage Scenarios","Public Record","Interactive Exploration"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467204","title":"Streamline Variability Plots for Characterizing the Uncertainty in Vector Field Ensembles","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":14,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics and Visualization Group, Technische Universität München","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606419000","id":37606419000,"full_name":"Florian Ferstl","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics and Visualization Group, Technische Universität München"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics and Visualization Group, Technische Universität München","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37587634700","id":37587634700,"full_name":"Kai Bürger","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics and Visualization Group, Technische Universität München"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics and Visualization Group, Technische Universität München","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37444424000","id":37444424000,"full_name":"Rüdiger Westermann","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics and Visualization Group, Technische Universität München"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present a new method to visualize from an ensemble of flow fields the statistical properties of streamlines passing through a selected location. We use principal component analysis to transform the set of streamlines into a low-dimensional Euclidean space. In this space the streamlines are clustered into major trends, and each cluster is in turn approximated by a multivariate Gaussian distribution. This yields a probabilistic mixture model for the streamline distribution, from which confidence regions can be derived in which the streamlines are most likely to reside. This is achieved by transforming the Gaussian random distributions from the low-dimensional Euclidean space into a streamline distribution that follows the statistical model, and by visualizing confidence regions in this distribution via iso-contours. We further make use of the principal component representation to introduce a new concept of streamline-median, based on existing median concepts in multidimensional Euclidean spaces. We demonstrate the potential of our method in a number of real-world examples, and we compare our results to alternative clustering approaches for particle trajectories as well as curve boxplots.","article_number":"7192675","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192675","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192675/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192675/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"767","end_page":"776","citing_paper_count":79,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1638,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Principal component analysis","Market research","Uncertainty","Data visualization","Visualization","Transforms","Feature extraction"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Ensemble visualization","uncertainty visualization","flow visualization","streamlines","statistical modeling","Ensemble visualization","uncertainty visualization","flow visualization","streamlines","statistical modeling"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Vector Field","Probabilistic Model","Flow Field","Clustering Approach","Euclidean Space","Low-dimensional Space","Lower-dimensional Space","Real-world Examples","Confidence Region","Diffusion Tensor Imaging","Diffusion-weighted Imaging","Diffusion Tensor","Expectation Maximization","EM Algorithm","Expectation-maximization Algorithm","Points In Space","Trends Data","Gaussian Mixture Model","Distribution Of Clusters","Visualization Techniques","Outlier Data","Arc Length","Curve Length","Agglomerative Clustering","Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering","Proper Orthogonal Decomposition","Diffusion Tensor Imaging Data","Ensemble Members","Dominant Trend","Confidence Ellipses","Pathlines","Space Domain","Median Line"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467195","title":"How do People Make Sense of Unfamiliar Visualizations?: A Grounded Model of Novice's Information Visualization Sensemaking","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":15,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Industrial Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085713433","id":37085713433,"full_name":"Sukwon Lee","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Industrial Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489894700","id":38489894700,"full_name":"Sung-Hee Kim","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Industrial Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085703024","id":37085703024,"full_name":"Ya-Hsin Hung","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Industrial Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Google Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37873130000","id":37873130000,"full_name":"Heidi Lam","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Google Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Techno-Art Division, Yonsei University, Incheon, South Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37673524700","id":37673524700,"full_name":"Youn-Ah Kang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Techno-Art Division, Yonsei University, Incheon, South Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Industrial Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38238292000","id":38238292000,"full_name":"Ji Soo Yi","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Industrial Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this paper, we would like to investigate how people make sense of unfamiliar information visualizations.

We collected data including audio/video record of think-aloud sessions and semi-structured interview; and analyzed the data using the grounded theory method. The primary result of this study is a grounded model of NOvice's information VIsualization Sensemaking (NOVIS model), which consists of the five major cognitive activities: 1 encountering visualization, 2 constructing a frame, 3 exploring visualization, 4 questioning the frame, and 5 floundering on visualization. We introduce the NOVIS model by explaining the five activities with representative quotes from our participants. We also explore the dynamics in the model. Lastly, we compare with other existing models and share further research directions that arose from our observations.","article_number":"7192668","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192668","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192668/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192668/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"499","end_page":"508","citing_paper_count":77,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":4285,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Encoding","Interviews","Hidden Markov models","Image color analysis","Vehicles"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Sensemaking model","information visualization","novice users","grounded theory","qualitative study","Sensemaking model","information visualization","novice users","grounded theory","qualitative study"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Semi-structured Interviews","Visual Information","Cognitive Activity","Flounder","Treemap","Functional Tree","Performance Of Trees","Grounded Theory Method","Chord Diagram","Personal Experiences","Bar Charts","Infographic","Graphical Display","Box Size","Top-down And Bottom-up","Series Of Activities","Visual Object","Pie Chart","Understanding Of Use","Understanding Of Users","Line Graph","Line Chart","Observation Sessions","Types Of Frames","Visual Encoding","Type Of Visualization","Sense-making Process","Visual Literacy","Mental Structures","Proper Frame","Co-moving Frame","Polyline","Bottom-up Processes","Open-source Software","Open Software","Open Coding","Top-down Processes"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467717","title":"Probing Projections: Interaction Techniques for Interpreting Arrangements and Errors of Dimensionality Reductions","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":16,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Potsdam University of Applied Sciences","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085683934","id":37085683934,"full_name":"Julian Stahnke","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Potsdam University of Applied Sciences"]}},{"affiliation":"Potsdam University of Applied Sciences","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590950400","id":37590950400,"full_name":"Marian Dörk","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Potsdam University of Applied Sciences"]}},{"affiliation":"Potsdam University of Applied Sciences","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37678892100","id":37678892100,"full_name":"Boris Müller","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Potsdam University of Applied Sciences"]}},{"affiliation":"Potsdam University of Applied Sciences","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37303090200","id":37303090200,"full_name":"Andreas Thom","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Potsdam University of Applied Sciences"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We introduce a set of integrated interaction techniques to interpret and interrogate dimensionality-reduced data. Projection techniques generally aim to make a high-dimensional information space visible in form of a planar layout. However, the meaning of the resulting data projections can be hard to grasp. It is seldom clear why elements are placed far apart or close together and the inevitable approximation errors of any projection technique are not exposed to the viewer. Previous research on dimensionality reduction focuses on the efficient generation of data projections, interactive customisation of the model, and comparison of different projection techniques. There has been only little research on how the visualization resulting from data projection is interacted with. We contribute the concept of probing as an integrated approach to interpreting the meaning and quality of visualizations and propose a set of interactive methods to examine dimensionality-reduced data as well as the projection itself. The methods let viewers see approximation errors, question the positioning of elements, compare them to each other, and visualize the influence of data dimensions on the projection space. We created a web-based system implementing these methods, and report on findings from an evaluation with data analysts using the prototype to examine multidimensional datasets.","article_number":"7192695","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192695","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192695/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192695/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"629","end_page":"638","citing_paper_count":73,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1470,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Distortion","Heating","Approximation error","Stress","Prototypes"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Information visualization","interactivity","dimensionality reduction","multidimensional scaling","Information visualization","interactivity","dimensionality reduction","multidimensional scaling"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Dimensionality Reduction","Interaction Techniques","Interactive","Estimation Error","Error Of Approximation","Visual Quality","Projective Space","Distortion","Heatmap","Distribution Of Values","Data Visualization","Dendrogram","Self-rated Health","Self-reported Health","Spatial Orientation","Spatial Direction","Data Elements","Density Plots","Value Dimensions","Visualization Techniques","Visual Environment","Visual Design","Original Dimensions","Projection Error","Project Quality","Agglomerative Algorithm","Functional Prototype","Scatterplot Matrix","Scatterplot Matrices","Representation Error","Correct Distance","High-dimensional Data Analysis","Visual Analysis Of Data","Part Of Project"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2468151","title":"egoSlider: Visual Analysis of Egocentric Network Evolution","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":17,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085523487","id":37085523487,"full_name":"Yanhong Wu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085682530","id":37085682530,"full_name":"Naveen Pitipornvivat","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Autodesk Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38024987300","id":38024987300,"full_name":"Jian Zhao","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Autodesk Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Huawei Technologies Co.

Evolutionary patterns of ego-networks along time provide huge insights to many domains such as sociology, anthropology, and psychology. However, the analysis of dynamic ego-networks remains challenging due to its complicated time-varying graph structures, for example: alters come and leave, ties grow stronger and fade away, and alter communities merge and split. Most of the existing dynamic graph visualization techniques mainly focus on topological changes of the entire network, which is not adequate for egocentric analytical tasks. In this paper, we present egoSlider, a visual analysis system for exploring and comparing dynamic ego-networks. egoSlider provides a holistic picture of the data through multiple interactively coordinated views, revealing ego-network evolutionary patterns at three different layers: a macroscopic level for summarizing the entire ego-network data, a mesoscopic level for overviewing specific individuals' ego-network evolutions, and a microscopic level for displaying detailed temporal information of egos and their alters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of egoSlider with a usage scenario with the DBLP publication records. Also, a controlled user study indicates that in general egoSlider outperforms a baseline visualization of dynamic networks for completing egocentric analytical tasks.","article_number":"7192725","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192725","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192725/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192725/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"260","end_page":"269","citing_paper_count":72,"citing_patent_count":2,"download_count":2460,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Data visualization","Microscopy","Feature extraction","Measurement","Social network services","Data analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Egocentric network","dynamic graph","network visualization","glyph-based design","visual analytics","Egocentric network","dynamic graph","network visualization","glyph-based design","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Egocentric Network","Social Networks","Evolutionary Patterns","Developmental Patterns","Visual System","Dynamic Network","User Study","Temporal Information","Analysis Tasks","Social Network Analysis","Microscopic Level","Macroscopic Level","Usage Scenarios","Dynamic Visualization","Dynamic Graph","Time Step","Interactive System","Visual Methods","Design Choices","Collaborative Network","Scale Level","Tie Strength","Visual Encoding","Task Level","Consecutive Time Steps","Visual Design","Overview Of Data","Analysis Of Questions","Public Performance","Control Panel","Structural Holes"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467615","title":"InterAxis: Steering Scatterplot Axes via Observation-Level Interaction","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":18,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085351744","id":37085351744,"full_name":"Hannah Kim","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Korea University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37602784600","id":37602784600,"full_name":"Jaegul Choo","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Korea University"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37277119500","id":37277119500,"full_name":"Haesun Park","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681759500","id":37681759500,"full_name":"Alex Endert","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Scatterplots are effective visualization techniques for multidimensional data that use two (or three) axes to visualize data items as a point at its corresponding x and y Cartesian coordinates. Typically, each axis is bound to a single data attribute. Interactive exploration occurs by changing the data attributes bound to each of these axes. In the case of using scatterplots to visualize the outputs of dimension reduction techniques, the x and y axes are combinations of the true, high-dimensional data. For these spatializations, the axes present usability challenges in terms of interpretability and interactivity. That is, understanding the axes and interacting with them to make adjustments can be challenging. In this paper, we present InterAxis, a visual analytics technique to properly interpret, define, and change an axis in a user-driven manner. Users are given the ability to define and modify axes by dragging data items to either side of the x or y axes, from which the system computes a linear combination of data attributes and binds it to the axis. Further, users can directly tune the positive and negative contribution to these complex axes by using the visualization of data attributes that correspond to each axis. We describe the details of our technique and demonstrate the intended usage through two scenarios.","article_number":"7192671","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192671","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192671/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192671/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"131","end_page":"140","citing_paper_count":67,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1506,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visual analytics","Principal component analysis","Semantics","Scalability","Data models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Scatterplots","user interaction","model steering","Scatterplots","user interaction","model steering"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Linear Combination","Dimensionality Reduction","Visual Analysis","Multidimensional Data","Multidimensional Analysis","Visualization Techniques","Interactive Exploration","Linear Model","Linear Regression Model","Visual System","Exploratory Data","Direct Use","Direct Utilization","Direct Manipulation","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Original Features","Original Characteristics","Nonlinear Method","Tacit Knowledge","Implicit Knowledge","Embodied Knowledge","Bar Charts","Dimensionality Reduction Methods","Linear Representation","Equivalent Representation","Retail Price","Usage Scenarios","Interaction Techniques","Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction Method","Side Of Axis","Scatter Plot Of Data","Scatterplots Of Data","Thousands Of Data","Linear Combination Of Features","Piecewise Linear Model","Self-organizing Map","Kohonen","Linear Combination Of Coefficients","Characteristics Of Data","Features Of Data"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467622","title":"Supporting Iterative Cohort Construction with Visual Temporal Queries","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":19,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"NYU","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085594931","id":37085594931,"full_name":"Josua Krause","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["NYU"]}},{"affiliation":"IBM T.J.

However, it is important to assess the explanatory power of such models when using them to inform design. We present a secondary analysis of data previously used to rank the effectiveness of bivariate visualizations for assessing correlation (measured with Pearson's r) according to the well-known Weber-Fechner Law. Beginning with the model of Harrison et al. [1], we present a sequence of refinements including incorporation of individual differences, log transformation, censored regression, and adoption of Bayesian statistics. Our model incorporates all observations dropped from the original analysis, including data near ceilings caused by the data collection process and entire visualizations dropped due to large numbers of observations worse than chance. This model deviates from Weber's Law, but provides improved predictive accuracy and generalization. Using Bayesian credibility intervals, we derive a partial ranking that groups visualizations with similar performance, and we give precise estimates of the difference in performance between these groups. We find that compared to other visualizations, scatterplots are unique in combining low variance between individuals and high precision on both positively- and negatively correlated data. We conclude with a discussion of the value of data sharing and replication, and share implications for modeling similar experimental data.","article_number":"7192661","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192661","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192661/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192661/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"469","end_page":"478","citing_paper_count":65,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1370,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Correlation","Data models","Analytical models","Predictive models","Visualization","Gaussian distribution"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Weber’s law","perception of correlation","log transformation","censored regression","Bayesian methods","Weber's law","perception of correlation","log transformation","censored regression","Bayesian methods"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Logarithm","Log Transformed","Logarithmic Transformation","Individual Differences","Differences In Performance","Bayesian Model","Bayesian Approach","Bayesian Network","Precise Estimates","Precision Of Estimates","Bayesian Credible Intervals","Partial Rank","Linear Model","Linear Regression Model","Normal Distribution","Gaussian Distribution","Parameter Estimates","Exploratory Analysis","Exploratory Data Analysis","Akaike Information Criterion","Akaike Criterion","Akaike Information Criteria","Posterior Probability","Posterior Distribution","Number Of Observations","Power-law","Scaling Law","Performance Variables","Lognormal","Lognormal Distribution","Average Performance","Log-linear","Linear Logistic Regression","Log-linear Model","Principled Way","Just Noticeable Difference","Parallel Coordinates","Non-constant Variance","Differences In Precision","Precise Differences","Total Rank","Excess Kurtosis","Staircase Procedure","Error Variance","Data Release","Fitting Line"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467621","title":"CiteRivers: Visual Analytics of Citation Patterns","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":21,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems (VIS), University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490630000","id":38490630000,"full_name":"Florian Heimerl","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems (VIS), University of Stuttgart"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems (VIS), University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085447519","id":37085447519,"full_name":"Qi Han","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems (VIS), University of Stuttgart"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems (VIS), University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593029700","id":37593029700,"full_name":"Steffen Koch","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems (VIS), University of Stuttgart"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems (VIS), University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268023800","id":37268023800,"full_name":"Thomas Ertl","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems (VIS), University of Stuttgart"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The exploration and analysis of scientific literature collections is an important task for effective knowledge management. Past interest in such document sets has spurred the development of numerous visualization approaches for their interactive analysis. They either focus on the textual content of publications, or on document metadata including authors and citations. Previously presented approaches for citation analysis aim primarily at the visualization of the structure of citation networks and their exploration. We extend the state-of-the-art by presenting an approach for the interactive visual analysis of the contents of scientific documents, and combine it with a new and flexible technique to analyze their citations. This technique facilitates user-steered aggregation of citations which are linked to the content of the citing publications using a highly interactive visualization approach. Through enriching the approach with additional interactive views of other important aspects of the data, we support the exploration of the dataset over time and enable users to analyze citation patterns, spot trends, and track long-term developments. We demonstrate the strengths of our approach through a use case and discuss it based on expert user feedback.","article_number":"7192685","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192685","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192685/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192685/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"190","end_page":"199","citing_paper_count":65,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":2596,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Market research","Metadata","Tag clouds","Data mining","Color","Joining processes"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["scientific literature","visual document analysis","visual citation analysis","streamgraph","clustering","scientific literature","visual document analysis","visual citation analysis","streamgraph","clustering"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Citation Patterns","Interaction Analysis","Metadata","Interactive Visualization","Visual Approach","Citation Analysis","Citation Network","Topical","Scientific Community","Data Mining","Public Settings","Cloud Data","Word Cloud","PhD Students","Spectral Method","Number Of Citations","Term Frequency","Clustering Tree","Term Frequency-inverse Document Frequency","Inverse Document Frequency","TF-IDF","Spectral Clustering","Citation Counts","Citation Impact","Citation Metrics","Public Venues","Visual Metaphors","Author Affiliations","Central Block","Development Of Themes","Visualization Of Datasets","Removing Stop Words","Adjacent Years","Lemmatization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467758","title":"Improving Bayesian Reasoning: The Effects of Phrasing, Visualization, and Spatial Ability","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":22,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Tufts University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38513524100","id":38513524100,"full_name":"Alvitta Ottley","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tufts University"]}},{"affiliation":"Bucknell University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085717352","id":37085717352,"full_name":"Evan M.

Yet in the medical domain, both physicians and patients make daily, life-critical judgments based on conditional probability. Although there have been a number of attempts to develop more effective ways to facilitate Bayesian reasoning, reports of these findings tend to be inconsistent and sometimes even contradictory. For instance, the reported accuracies for individuals being able to correctly estimate conditional probability range from 6% to 62%. In this work, we show that problem representation can significantly affect accuracies. By controlling the amount of information presented to the user, we demonstrate how text and visualization designs can increase overall accuracies to as high as 77%. Additionally, we found that for users with high spatial ability, our designs can further improve their accuracies to as high as 100%. By and large, our findings provide explanations for the inconsistent reports on accuracy in Bayesian reasoning tasks and show a significant improvement over existing methods. We believe that these findings can have immediate impact on risk communication in health-related fields.","article_number":"7192720","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192720","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192720/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192720/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"529","end_page":"538","citing_paper_count":64,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1337,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Bayes methods","Cognition","Accuracy","Diseases","Breast cancer","Sociology"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Bayesian Reasoning","Visualization","Spatial Ability","Individual Differences","Bayesian Reasoning","Visualization","Spatial Ability","Individual Differences"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Spatial Ability","Effective Ability","Bayesian Reasoning","Bayesian Logic","Amount Of Information","High Ability","Conditional Probability","Problem Representation","Visual Design","Breast Cancer","False Positive Rate","Low Use","Low Utilization","Low Usage","Visual Representation","Fundamental Frequency","Natural Frequency","Low Ability","False Negative Rate","Increase In Accuracy","Textual Information","Mechanical Turk","Mental Models","Text Representation","Visual Conditions","Visual Status","Understanding Of The Problem","Problem Framing","Grid Frequency","Single Instance","Single Representation","Prior Results","Prior Outcomes","Visual Aids","High Use","High Utilization","High Usage","Difference In Accuracy"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467871","title":"VA2: A Visual Analytics Approach for Evaluating Visual Analytics Applications","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":23,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems (VIS), University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085671312","id":37085671312,"full_name":"Tanja Blascheck","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems (VIS), University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems (VIS), University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085484719","id":37085484719,"full_name":"Markus John","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems (VIS), University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Visualization Research Center, University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489885500","id":38489885500,"full_name":"Kuno Kurzhals","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visualization Research Center, University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems (VIS), University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593029700","id":37593029700,"full_name":"Steffen Koch","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems (VIS), University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems (VIS), University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268023800","id":37268023800,"full_name":"Thomas Ertl","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems (VIS), University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Evaluation has become a fundamental part of visualization research and researchers have employed many approaches from the field of human-computer interaction like measures of task performance, thinking aloud protocols, and analysis of interaction logs.

However, only few approaches exist that aim at an integrated analysis of multiple concurrent evaluation procedures. The variety, complexity, and sheer amount of such coupled multi-source data streams require a visual analytics approach. Our approach provides a highly interactive visualization environment to display and analyze thinking aloud, interaction, and eye movement data in close relation. Automatic pattern finding algorithms allow an efficient exploratory search and support the reasoning process to derive common eye-interaction-thinking patterns between participants. In addition, our tool equips researchers with mechanisms for searching and verifying expected usage patterns.

In recent years, the widespread use of mobile phones brings an unprecedented opportunity to capture large-scale and fine-grained data to study co-occurrence in human mobility. However, due to the lack of systematic and efficient methods, it is challenging for analysts to carry out in-depth analyses and extract valuable information. In this paper, we present TelCoVis, an interactive visual analytics system, which helps analysts leverage their domain knowledge to gain insight into the co-occurrence in urban human mobility based on telco data. Our system integrates visualization techniques with new designs and combines them in a novel way to enhance analysts' perception for a comprehensive exploration. In addition, we propose to study the correlations in co-occurrence (i.e. people from multiple regions visit different places during the same time span) by means of biclustering techniques that allow analysts to better explore coordinated relationships among different regions and identify interesting patterns. The case studies based on a real-world dataset and interviews with domain experts have demonstrated the effectiveness of our system in gaining insights into co-occurrence and facilitating various analytical tasks.","article_number":"7192730","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192730","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192730/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192730/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"935","end_page":"944","citing_paper_count":62,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2085,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Mobile handsets","Correlation","Data mining","Visual analytics","Sociology"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Co-occurrence","human mobility","telco data","bicluster","visual analytics","Co-occurrence","human mobility","telco data","bicluster","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Exploration","Urban Human Mobility","Telco Data","Mobile Phone","Time Span","Visual System","Visual Analysis","Interesting Patterns","Pattern Of Involvement","Analysis Tasks","Domain Experts","Contagious Disease","Exposure To Disease","Visualization Techniques","Business Intelligence","Business Information","Number Of People","Voronoi Diagram","Voronoi Tessellation","Voronoi Cell","Sociological Studies","Number Of Places","Co-occurrence Patterns","Treemap","Functional Tree","Performance Of Trees","Concomitant Effects","Co-occurrence Of Events","Concomitant Events","Set Of Places","Parallel Coordinates","Human Mobility Patterns","Peak Hours","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Visual Design","Mobile Phone Users","Co-occurrence Analysis","Concomitant Analysis","Mobile Phone Data","Map View"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467112","title":"Visualization, Selection, and Analysis of Traffic Flows","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":25,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37846960800","id":37846960800,"full_name":"Roeland Scheepens","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands"]}},{"affiliation":"Interactive Computing Laboratory (LII) of the French Civil Aviation University (ENAC) in Toulouse, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017336200","id":38017336200,"full_name":"Christophe Hurter","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Interactive Computing Laboratory (LII) of the French Civil Aviation University (ENAC) in Toulouse, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294473300","id":37294473300,"full_name":"Huub Van De Wetering","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267249200","id":37267249200,"full_name":"Jarke J.

It also hinders adding additional visual information, such as direction, and makes it difficult to interactively extract traffic flows, i.e., subsets of trajectories. In this paper we present our approach to visualize traffic flows and provide interaction tools to support their exploration. We show an overview of the traffic using a density map. The directions of traffic flows are visualized using a particle system on top of the density map. The user can extract traffic flows using a novel selection widget that allows for the intuitive selection of an area, and filtering on a range of directions and any additional attributes. Using simple, visual set expressions, the user can construct more complicated selections. The dynamic behaviors of selected flows may then be shown in annotation windows in which they can be interactively explored and compared. We validate our approach through use cases where we explore and analyze the temporal behavior of aircraft and vessel trajectories, e.g., landing and takeoff sequences, or the evolution of flight route density. The aircraft use cases have been developed and validated in collaboration with domain experts.","article_number":"7192701","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192701","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192701/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192701/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"379","end_page":"388","citing_paper_count":59,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":3103,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Trajectory","Visualization","Aircraft","Data visualization","Image color analysis","Color","Data mining"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Moving Object Visualization","traffic flows","interaction","Moving Object Visualization","traffic flows","interaction"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Traffic Flow","Vehicular Traffic","Traffic Speed","Flow Direction","Density Map","Effect Of Particles","Particle System","Domain Experts","Object Motion","Moving Objects","Range Direction","Altitude","Flow Data","Traffic Congestion","Traffic Density","Traffic Jams","Supplementary Video","Flow Dynamics","Color Map","Selective Compounds","Visualization Techniques","Time Bins","Air Control","Air Traffic Control","Target User","Number Of Trajectories","High Frame Rate","Time-varying Properties","Time-varying Attributes","Aviation Safety","Air Safety","Flight Safety","Direct Trajectory","Interaction Techniques","Multiple Flow","Particles In Space","Paris Area"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467471","title":"A Linguistic Approach to Categorical Color Assignment for Data Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":26,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Tableau Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37392286200","id":37392286200,"full_name":"Vidya Setlur","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tableau Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Tableau Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37376130500","id":37376130500,"full_name":"Maureen C.

To do this effectively, we need first to establish that a term has a strong semantic color association, then discover which color or colors express it. Using co-occurrence measures of color name frequencies from Google n-grams, we define a measure for colorability that describes how strongly associated a given term is to any of a set of basic color terms. We then show how this colorability score can be used with additional semantic analysis to rank and retrieve a representative color from Google Images. Alternatively, we use symbolic relationships defined by WordNet to select identity colors for categories such as countries or brands. To create visually distinct color palettes, we use k-means clustering to create visually distinct sets, iteratively reassigning terms with multiple basic color associations as needed. This can be additionally constrained to use colors only in a predefined palette.","article_number":"7192709","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192709","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192709/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192709/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"698","end_page":"707","citing_paper_count":59,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1923,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image color analysis","Semantics","Color","Google","Data visualization","Context","Databases"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["linguistics","natural language processing","semantics","color names","categorical color","Google n-grams","WordNet","XKCD","Linguistics","natural language processing","semantics","color names","categorical color","Google n-grams","WordNet","XKCD"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Visualization","Color Categories","Color Classification","Color Assignment","Color Word","Color-naming","Basic Terms","Color Palette","Multiple Colors","WordNet","Color Representation","Basic Color","Centroid","Set Of Values","Precision And Recall","Selection Algorithm","Common Name","Vernacular Names","Common Design","Categorical Values","Color Values","Similar Color","Dominant Color","Dominant Region","Lowest Common Ancestor","Least Common Ancestor","Image Retrieval","Image Search","Semantic Context","Vermilion","Red Values","Apricot","Prunus Armeniaca","Lavender","Lavandula","Visual Symbols"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467613","title":"A Case Study Using Visualization Interaction Logs and Insight Metrics to Understand How Analysts Arrive at Insights","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":27,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Brown University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489241200","id":38489241200,"full_name":"Hua Guo","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Brown University"]}},{"affiliation":"Brown University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489539100","id":38489539100,"full_name":"Steven R.

The use of lo-fidelity prototyping, especially paper-based sketching, can save time, money and converge to better solutions more quickly. However, this design process is often viewed to be too informal. Consequently users do not know how to manage their thoughts and ideas (to first think divergently, to then finally converge on a suitable solution). We present the Five Design Sheet (FdS) methodology. The methodology enables users to create information visualization interfaces through lo-fidelity methods. Users sketch and plan their ideas, helping them express different possibilities, think through these ideas to consider their potential effectiveness as solutions to the task (sheet 1); they create three principle designs (sheets 2,3 and 4); before converging on a final realization design that can then be implemented (sheet 5). In this article, we present (i) a review of the use of sketching as a planning method for visualization and the benefits of sketching, (ii) a detailed description of the Five Design Sheet (FdS) methodology, and (iii) an evaluation of the FdS using the System Usability Scale, along with a case-study of its use in industry and experience of its use in teaching.","article_number":"7192707","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192707","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192707/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192707/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"419","end_page":"428","citing_paper_count":56,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":3544,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Data visualization","Prototypes","Planning","Computer science","Companies"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Lo-fidelity prototyping","User-centred design","Sketching for visualization","Ideation","Lo-fidelity prototyping","User-centred design","Sketching for visualization","Ideation","C4240C","C4210L","C1140Z","C1160"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Prototype","Visual Information","Final Design","Final Assignment","Visual Interface","System Usability Scale","Components Of System","Computer Science","Visualization Tool","Sheet Of Paper","Interactive Visualization","Interaction Design","Visual Design","Divergent Thinking","Design Thinking","Students Plan","Convergent Thinking","Lot Of Ideas"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467451","title":"HOLA: Human-like Orthogonal Network Layout","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":29,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Monash University and NICTA Victoria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085607255","id":37085607255,"full_name":"Steve Kieffer","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University and NICTA Victoria"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37326161000","id":37326161000,"full_name":"Tim Dwyer","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University and NICTA Victoria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37354163600","id":37354163600,"full_name":"Kim Marriott","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University and NICTA Victoria"]}},{"affiliation":"Monash University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37867777700","id":37867777700,"full_name":"Michael Wybrow","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Monash University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Over the last 50 years a wide variety of automatic network layout algorithms have been developed. Some are fast heuristic techniques suitable for networks with hundreds of thousands of nodes while others are multi-stage frameworks for higher-quality layout of smaller networks. However, despite decades of research currently no algorithm produces layout of comparable quality to that of a human. We give a new “human-centred” methodology for automatic network layout algorithm design that is intended to overcome this deficiency. User studies are first used to identify the aesthetic criteria algorithms should encode, then an algorithm is developed that is informed by these criteria and finally, a follow-up study evaluates the algorithm output. We have used this new methodology to develop an automatic orthogonal network layout method, HOLA, that achieves measurably better (by user study) layout than the best available orthogonal layout algorithm and which produces layouts of comparable quality to those produced by hand.","article_number":"7192690","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192690","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192690/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192690/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"349","end_page":"358","citing_paper_count":53,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1846,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Layout","Algorithm design and analysis","Manuals","Standards","Software algorithms","Visualization","Software"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Graph layout","orthogonal layout","automatic layout algorithms","user-generated layout","graph-drawing aesthetics","Graph layout","orthogonal layout","automatic layout algorithms","user-generated layout","graph-drawing aesthetics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Network Layout","Orthogonal Network","User Study","Algorithm Design","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Readability","Bounding Box","Tree Structure","Root Node","Parent Node","Orthonormal","Orthogonalization","Growth Direction","Human Values","Leaf Node","User Preferences","Cardinal Directions","Compass Direction","Cardinal Points","Large Graphs","Default Configuration","Input Graph","Pipeline Stages","Graph Layout","Graph Drawing","Small Graphs","Chain Configuration","Van Ham"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467553","title":"Temporal MDS Plots for Analysis of Multivariate Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":30,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233561600","id":38233561600,"full_name":"Dominik Jäckle","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38242836400","id":38242836400,"full_name":"Fabian Fischer","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Graz University of Technology, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282557600","id":37282557600,"full_name":"Tobias Schreck","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Graz University of Technology, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","id":37283138700,"full_name":"Daniel A.

Examples include data from computer networks, healthcare, social networks, or financial markets. Often, patterns in such data evolve over time among multiple dimensions and are hard to detect. Dimensionality reduction methods such as PCA and MDS allow analysis and visualization of multivariate data, but per se do not provide means to explore multivariate patterns over time. We propose Temporal Multidimensional Scaling (TMDS), a novel visualization technique that computes temporal one-dimensional MDS plots for multivariate data which evolve over time. Using a sliding window approach, MDS is computed for each data window separately, and the results are plotted sequentially along the time axis, taking care of plot alignment. Our TMDS plots enable visual identification of patterns based on multidimensional similarity of the data evolving over time. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach in the field of network security and show in two case studies how users can iteratively explore the data to identify previously unknown, temporally evolving patterns.","article_number":"7192673","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192673","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192673/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192673/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"141","end_page":"150","citing_paper_count":53,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":2001,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Correlation","Security","Communication networks","Indexes","Layout"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Multivariate Data","Time Series","Data Reduction","Multidimensional Scaling","Multivariate Data","Time Series","Data Reduction","Multidimensional Scaling"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Multivariate Data","Multivariate Statistics","Multivariate Data Analysis","Multidimensional Scaling Plot","Temporal Plots","Data Visualization","Identification Of Patterns","Digital Networks","Computer Network","Visualization Techniques","Field Of Security","Multivariate Time Series Data","Spatial Patterns","Spatiotemporal Patterns","Temporal Patterns","Computation Time","Calculation Time","Window Size","Distance Matrix","Distance Matrices","Data Entry","Partial Data","Distance Values","Shannon Entropy","Temporal Data","Visual Patterns","Salient Patterns","Destination Port","Variety Of Matrices","Diversity Matrix","Diversity Matrices","Parallel Coordinates","DoS Attacks","Multivariate Datasets","Brute-force Attacks","Single Entry","Single Entrance","Network Of Companies","Self-organizing Map","Kohonen"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467324","title":"A comparative study between RadViz and Star Coordinates","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":31,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"URJC","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085558323","id":37085558323,"full_name":"Manuel Rubio-Sánchez","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["URJC"]}},{"affiliation":"U-tad","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37713856400","id":37713856400,"full_name":"Laura Raya","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["U-tad"]}},{"affiliation":"UPM","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085686255","id":37085686255,"full_name":"Francisco Díaz","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UPM"]}},{"affiliation":"URJC and CCS","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37270045700","id":37270045700,"full_name":"Alberto Sanchez","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["URJC and CCS"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"RadViz and star coordinates are two of the most popular projection-based multivariate visualization techniques that arrange variables in radial layouts.

In particular, we observe that the normalization step introduces nonlinear distortions, can encumber outlier detection, prevents associating the plots with useful linear mappings, and impedes estimating original data attributes accurately. In addition, users have greater flexibility when choosing different layouts and views of the data in star coordinates.

Working with stroke experts, we seek to provide a tool to help improve outcomes for stroke victims. Time is of critical importance in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke patients. Every minute that the artery stays blocked, an estimated 1.9 million neurons and 12 km of myelinated axons are destroyed. Consequently, there is a critical need for efficiency of stroke treatment processes. Optimizing time to treatment requires a deep understanding of interval times. Stroke health care professionals must analyze the impact of procedures, events, and patient attributes on time-ultimately, to save lives and improve quality of life after stroke. First, we interviewed eight domain experts, and closely collaborated with two of them to inform the design of TimeSpan. We classify the analytical tasks which a visualization tool should support and extract design goals from the interviews and field observations. Based on these tasks and the understanding gained from the collaboration, we designed TimeSpan, a web-based tool for exploring multi-dimensional and temporal stroke data. We describe how TimeSpan incorporates factors from stacked bar graphs, line charts, histograms, and a matrix visualization to create an interactive hybrid view of temporal data. From feedback collected from domain experts in a focus group session, we reflect on the lessons we learned from abstracting the tasks and iteratively designing TimeSpan.","article_number":"7192713","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192713","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192713/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192713/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"409","end_page":"418","citing_paper_count":51,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1768,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Hospitals","Delays","Visualization","Interviews","Computed tomography","Needles"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Multi-dimensional data,","Temporal event sequences","Electronic health records","Multi-dimensional data","Temporal event sequences","Electronic health records"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Stroke Patients","Multidimensional Data","Multidimensional Analysis","Temporal Data","Data Of Stroke Patients","Interactive","Focus Group","Acute Stroke","Visualization Tool","Analysis Tasks","Domain Experts","Design Goals","Focus Group Sessions","Acute Stroke Patients","Line Chart","Computed Tomography","Computed Tomography Scan","CT Scan","Patient Data","Time Span","Aggregate Data","Time In Patients","Temporal Dimension","Time Dimension","Temporal Properties","Stroke Team","Stroke Neurologists","Exploratory Data","Detailed View","Emergency Medical Service Services","Patient Arrival","Overview Of Patients","Groin Puncture","Temporal Effects","Temporal Events","Real-world Data"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467554","title":"An Uncertainty-Aware Approach for Exploratory Microblog Retrieval","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":34,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Tsinghua University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077049000","id":37077049000,"full_name":"Mengchen Liu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tsinghua University"]}},{"affiliation":"Tsinghua University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406039100","id":37406039100,"full_name":"Shixia Liu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tsinghua University"]}},{"affiliation":"USTC","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086226296","id":37086226296,"full_name":"Xizhou Zhu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["USTC"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085674690","id":37085674690,"full_name":"Qinying Liao","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085490145","id":37085490145,"full_name":"Furu Wei","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland, Baltimore County","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085387717","id":37085387717,"full_name":"Shimei Pan","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland, Baltimore County"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Although there has been a great deal of interest in analyzing customer opinions and breaking news in microblogs, progress has been hampered by the lack of an effective mechanism to discover and retrieve data of interest from microblogs.

We extend an existing ranking technique to compute a multifaceted retrieval result: the mutual reinforcement rank of a graph node, the uncertainty of each rank, and the propagation of uncertainty among different graph nodes. To illustrate the three facets, we have also designed a composite visualization with three visual components: a graph visualization, an uncertainty glyph, and a flow map. The graph visualization with glyphs, the flow map, and the uncertainty analysis together enable analysts to effectively find the most uncertain results and interactively refine them.

We aim to show the spatio-temporal data of the gaze points in the context of the underlying image or video stimulus without occlusion. Our technique, denoted as gaze stripes, does not require the explicit definition of areas of interest but directly uses the image data around the gaze points, similar to thumbnails for images. A gaze stripe consists of a sequence of such gaze point images, oriented along a horizontal timeline. By displaying multiple aligned gaze stripes, it is possible to analyze and compare the viewing behavior of the participants over time. Since the analysis is carried out directly on the image data, expensive post-processing or manual annotation are not required. Therefore, not only patterns and outliers in the participants' scanpaths can be detected, but the context of the stimulus is available as well. Furthermore, our approach is especially well suited for dynamic stimuli due to the non-aggregated temporal mapping.

Though there are a growing number of tools and techniques for exploring single models, comparisons between models are generally reduced to a small set of numerical metrics. These metrics may or may not reflect a model's performance on the analyst's intended task, and can therefore be insufficient to diagnose what causes differences between models. In this paper, we explore task-centric topic model comparison, considering how we can both provide detail for a more nuanced understanding of differences and address the wealth of tasks for which topic models are used. We derive comparison tasks from single-model uses of topic models, which predominantly fall into the categories of understanding topics, understanding similarity, and understanding change. Finally, we provide several visualization techniques that facilitate these tasks, including buddy plots, which combine color and position encodings to allow analysts to readily view changes in document similarity.","article_number":"7194832","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194832","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7194832/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7194832/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"320","end_page":"329","citing_paper_count":47,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1913,"insert_date":"20150813","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Measurement","Computational modeling","Encoding","Visualization","Color","Analytical models","Numerical models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Text visualization","topic modeling","Text visualization","topic modeling"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Model Comparison","Topic Modeling","Similar Changes","Text Analysis","Visualization Techniques","Subject Categories","Topic Categories","Topic Classification","Classification Of Subjects","Comparison Task","Numerous Metrics","Semantic","Parameter Space","Horizontal Axis","Similarity Matrix","Similarity Matrices","Vantage Point","Change In Distance","Multiple Subjects","Multiple Topics","Multiple Themes","Non-negative Matrix Factorization","Topic Distribution","Distribution Of Subjects","Function Words","Word Structure","Individual Words","Set Of Distances","Topic Words","Subject Words","Theme Words","Rank Changes","Different Numbers Of Topics","Different Number Of Subjects","Parallel Plot","Order Of Hundreds","Statistical Metrics","Single Plot","Parallel Coordinates"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467411","title":"In Situ Eddy Analysis in a High-Resolution Ocean Climate Model","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":37,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37542815100","id":37542815100,"full_name":"Jonathan Woodring","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37529329300","id":37529329300,"full_name":"Mark Petersen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics and HCI Group, University of Kaiserslautern, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088704468","id":37088704468,"full_name":"Andre Schmeißer","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics and HCI Group, University of Kaiserslautern, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37570501800","id":37570501800,"full_name":"John Patchett","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282713700","id":37282713700,"full_name":"James Ahrens","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics and HCI Group, University of Kaiserslautern, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282578800","id":37282578800,"full_name":"Hans Hagen","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics and HCI Group, University of Kaiserslautern, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"An eddy is a feature associated with a rotating body of fluid, surrounded by a ring of shearing fluid. In the ocean, eddies are 10 to 150 km in diameter, are spawned by boundary currents and baroclinic instabilities, may live for hundreds of days, and travel for hundreds of kilometers. Eddies are important in climate studies because they transport heat, salt, and nutrients through the world's oceans and are vessels of biological productivity. The study of eddies in global ocean-climate models requires large-scale, high-resolution simulations. This poses a problem for feasible (timely) eddy analysis, as ocean simulations generate massive amounts of data, causing a bottleneck for traditional analysis workflows. To enable eddy studies, we have developed an in situ workflow for the quantitative and qualitative analysis of MPAS-Ocean, a high-resolution ocean climate model, in collaboration with the ocean model research and development process. Planned eddy analysis at high spatial and temporal resolutions will not be possible with a postprocessing workflow due to various constraints, such as storage size and I/O time, but the in situ workflow enables it and scales well to ten-thousand processing elements.","article_number":"7192723","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192723","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192723/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192723/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"857","end_page":"866","citing_paper_count":47,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":945,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Oceans","Analytical models","Computational modeling","Meteorology","Computer architecture","Atmospheric modeling","Microprocessors"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["In situ analysis","online analysis","mesoscale eddies","ocean modeling","climate modeling","simulation","feature extraction","feature analysis","high performance computing","supercomputing","software engineering","collaborative development","revision control","In situ analysis","online analysis","mesoscale eddies","ocean modeling","climate modeling","simulation","feature extraction","feature analysis","high performance computing","supercomputing","software engineering","collaborative development","revision control"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Climate Models","Climate Simulations","High-resolution Ocean","Ocean Climate Model","Research And Development","Global Ocean","Ocean Sea","World Ocean","High-resolution Simulations","Boundary Current","Km In Diameter","Parallelization","Parallel Computing","Grid Cells","Computational Domain","Calculation Domain","Sea Ice","File System","File Storage","Southern Ocean","Large-scale Simulations","Scientific Goals","Coriolis Force","Los Alamos National Laboratory","Global Simulations","Forward Mode","Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation","Strong Scaling","Ocean State","Horizontal Area","Grid Cell Size","Post-processing Analysis","Gulf Stream","Ocean Eddies","Simulation Code"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467931","title":"The Visual Causality Analyst: An Interactive Interface for Causal Reasoning","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":38,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085621793","id":37085621793,"full_name":"Jun Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science Dept., SUNY, Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273119700","id":37273119700,"full_name":"Klaus Mueller","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Dept., SUNY, Korea","Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Uncovering the causal relations that exist among variables in multivariate datasets is one of the ultimate goals in data analytics. Causation is related to correlation but correlation does not imply causation. While a number of casual discovery algorithms have been devised that eliminate spurious correlations from a network, there are no guarantees that all of the inferred causations are indeed true. Hence, bringing a domain expert into the casual reasoning loop can be of great benefit in identifying erroneous casual relationships suggested by the discovery algorithm. To address this need we present the Visual Causal Analyst - a novel visual causal reasoning framework that allows users to apply their expertise, verify and edit causal links, and collaborate with the causal discovery algorithm to identify a valid causal network. Its interface consists of both an interactive 2D graph view and a numerical presentation of salient statistical parameters, such as regression coefficients, p-values, and others. Both help users in gaining a good understanding of the landscape of causal structures particularly when the number of variables is large. Our framework is also novel in that it can handle both numerical and categorical variables within one unified model and return plausible results. We demonstrate its use via a set of case studies using multiple practical datasets.","article_number":"7192729","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192729","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192729/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192729/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"230","end_page":"239","citing_paper_count":46,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":1820,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Correlation","Visualization","Layout","Linear regression","Optimization","Inference algorithms"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual knowledge discovery","Causality","Hypothesis testing","Visual evidence","High-dimensional data","Visual knowledge discovery","Causality","Hypothesis testing","Visual evidence","High-dimensional data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive","Causal Reasoning","Causal Relationship","Regression Coefficients","Numerical Variables","Joint Effect","Spurious Correlations","Multiple Datasets","Variance In The Dataset","Related Cases","Causal Structure","Causal Network","Set Of Case Studies","Visual Reasoning","Regression Analysis","Linear Regression Analysis","Bayesian Model","Bayesian Approach","Bayesian Network","Observational Data","Signs Of Disease","Causal Inference","Partial Correlation","Partial Correlation Coefficients","Causal Graph","Pairs Of Variables","Directed Acyclic Graph","Causal Analysis","Direct Causal Relationship","Causal Model","Visual Interface","Spatial Layout","UCI Machine Learning Repository","Significant Heart Disease"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467751","title":"TimeNotes: A Study on Effective Chart Visualization and Interaction Techniques for Time-Series Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":39,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Swansea University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085628222","id":37085628222,"full_name":"James Walker","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Swansea University"]}},{"affiliation":"Swansea University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591074800","id":37591074800,"full_name":"Rita Borgo","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Swansea University"]}},{"affiliation":"Swansea University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37335785800","id":37335785800,"full_name":"Mark W.

Individual indicators are selected and combined to reflect a phenomena being measured. Visualization of a composite indicator is recommended as a tool to enable interested stakeholders, as well as the public audience, to better understand the indicator components and evolution overtime. However, existing CI visualizations introduce a variety of solutions and there is a lack in CI's visualization guidelines. Radial visualizations are popular among these solutions because of CI's inherent multi-dimensionality. Although in dispute, Radar-charts are often used for CI presentation. However, no empirical evidence on Radar's effectiveness and efficiency for common CI tasks is available. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by reporting on a controlled experiment that compares the Radar chart technique with two other radial visualization methods: Flowercharts as used in the well-known OECD Betterlife index, and Circle-charts which could be adopted for this purpose. Examples of these charts in the current context are shown in Figure 1. We evaluated these charts, showing the same data with each of the mentioned techniques applying small multiple views for different dimensions of the data. We compared users' performance and preference empirically under a formal task-taxonomy. Results indicate that the Radar chart was the least effective and least liked, while performance of the two other options were mixed and dependent on the task. Results also showed strong preference of participants toward the Flower chart. Summarizing our results, we provide specific design guidelines for composite indicator visualization.","article_number":"7192648","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192648","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192648/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192648/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"569","end_page":"578","citing_paper_count":45,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":1312,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Radar","Data visualization","Visualization","Benchmark testing","Image color analysis","Urban areas"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization evaluation","radial layout design","composite indicator visualization","experiment","Visualization evaluation","radial layout design","composite indicator visualization","experiment"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Composite Index","Composite Indicator","Information Technology","Information And Communication Technologies","Pie Chart","User Preferences","Radar Chart","Radar Graph","Benchmarking Tool","Error Rate","Completion Time","End Of Session","End Of Each Session","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Color Code","Digital Divide","Poor Information","Task Accuracy","Information Society","Company Information","Growth Of Information","Digital Society","Emergency Information","Interactive Visualization","Multiple Items","Between-subject Variability","Within-subject Variability","Task Completion Time","Subjective Preferences","Parallel Coordinates","Dynamic Visualization","Identification Of Trends","Visual Encoding","Comparison Task"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467831","title":"Visual Mementos: Reflecting Memories with Personal Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":42,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085741208","id":37085741208,"full_name":"Alice Thudt","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary"]}},{"affiliation":"An Independent Researcher","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590949400","id":37590949400,"full_name":"Dominikus Baur","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["An Independent Researcher"]}},{"affiliation":"IRI","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077910700","id":37077910700,"full_name":"Samuel Huron","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IRI","University of Calgary"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37285000100","id":37285000100,"full_name":"Sheelagh Carpendale","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this paper we discuss the creation of visual mementos as a new application area for visualization.

Drawing on research on autobiographical memory and on the role of artifacts in reminiscing, we identified design challenges for visual mementos: mapping data to evoke familiarity, expressing subjectivity, and obscuring sensitive details for sharing. Visual mementos can make use of the known strengths of visualization in revealing patterns to show the familiar instead of the unexpected, and extend representational mappings beyond the objective to include the more subjective. To understand whether people's subjective views on their past can be reflected in a visual representation, we developed, deployed and studied a technology probe that exemplifies our concept of visual mementos.

However, any particular drawing approach cannot fully satisfy all these criteria simultaneously, producing drawings with visual ambiguities that can impede the understanding of network structure. To bring attention to these potentially problematic areas present in the drawing, this paper presents a technique that highlights common types of visual ambiguities: ambiguous spatial relationships between nodes and edges, visual overlap between community structures, and ambiguity in edge bundling and metanodes. Metrics, including newly proposed metrics for abnormal edge lengths, visual overlap in community structures and node/edge aggregation, are proposed to quantify areas of ambiguity in the drawing. These metrics and others are then displayed using a heatmap-based visualization that provides visual feedback to developers of graph drawing and visualization approaches, allowing them to quickly identify misleading areas. The novel metrics and the heatmap-based visualization allow a user to explore ambiguities in graph layouts from multiple perspectives in order to make reasonable graph layout choices. The effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated through case studies and expert reviews.","article_number":"7192724","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192724","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192724/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192724/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"359","end_page":"368","citing_paper_count":42,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2283,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Measurement","Layout","Heating","Image edge detection","Entropy","Readability metrics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual Ambiguity","Visualization","Node-link diagram","Graph layout","Graph visualization","Visual Ambiguity","Visualization","Node-link diagram","Graph layout","Graph visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Graph Layout","Graph Drawing","Community Structure","Visual Feedback","Video Feedback","Problem Areas","Expert Review","Edge Length","Visibility Graph","Areas Of Ambiguity","Ambiguous Areas","Types Of Ambiguity","Ambiguous Type","Hot Spots","Misinformation","Misleading Information","False Information","Nodes In The Graph","Graph Structure","Color Map","Convex Hull","Visualization Techniques","Aggregation Method","Multiple Edges","Multi-edge","Parallel Edges","Visual Similarity","Global Metrics","Local Metrics","Aggregator Node","Potential Ambiguity","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Large Graphs"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467552","title":"The Data Context Map: Fusing Data and Attributes into a Unified Display","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":44,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Visual Analytics and Imaging Laboratory, Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University and SUNY, Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085387617","id":37085387617,"full_name":"Shenghui Cheng","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Analytics and Imaging Laboratory, Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University and SUNY, Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Visual Analytics and Imaging Laboratory, Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University and SUNY, Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273119700","id":37273119700,"full_name":"Klaus Mueller","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Analytics and Imaging Laboratory, Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University and SUNY, Korea"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Numerous methods have been described that allow the visualization of the data matrix. But all suffer from a common problem - observing the data points in the context of the attributes is either impossible or inaccurate. We describe a method that allows these types of comprehensive layouts. We achieve it by combining two similarity matrices typically used in isolation - the matrix encoding the similarity of the attributes and the matrix encoding the similarity of the data points. This combined matrix yields two of the four submatrices needed for a full multi-dimensional scaling type layout. The remaining two submatrices are obtained by creating a fused similarity matrix - one that measures the similarity of the data points with respect to the attributes, and vice versa. The resulting layout places the data objects in direct context of the attributes and hence we call it the data context map. It allows users to simultaneously appreciate (1) the similarity of data objects, (2) the similarity of attributes in the specific scope of the collection of data objects, and (3) the relationships of data objects with attributes and vice versa. The contextual layout also allows data regions to be segmented and labeled based on the locations of the attributes. This enables, for example, the map's application in selection tasks where users seek to identify one or more data objects that best fit a certain configuration of factors, using the map to visually balance the tradeoffs.","article_number":"7194836","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194836","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7194836/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7194836/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"121","end_page":"130","citing_paper_count":41,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1635,"insert_date":"20150813","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Layout","Context","Measurement","Correlation","Optimization","Data visualization","Symmetric matrices"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["High Dimensional Data","Low-Dimensional Embedding","Visual Analytics,","Decision Make","Tradeoffs,","High Dimensional Data","Low-Dimensional Embedding","Visual Analytics","Decision Make","Tradeoffs"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Similar Properties","Similar Attributes","Similar Dimensions","Data Matrix","Data Matrices","Similarity Matrix","Similarity Matrices","Submatrix","Submatrices","Linear Function","Linear Map","Distance Matrix","Distance Matrices","Point Cloud","Data Space","Related Samples","Variable Space","Random Set","Decision Boundary","Distance Metrics","Distance Map","Distance Transform","Distance Field","Green Region","Types Of Points","Self-organizing Map","Kohonen","Locally Linear Embedding","Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction","Polyline","Multiple Correspondence Analysis","Parallel Coordinates","Layout Optimization","Adaptive Kernel","Academic Scores","Types Of Relationships","Matrix M","Matrices M","Linear Discriminant Analysis","Discriminant Function","Discriminant Function Analysis"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467958","title":"Isosurface Visualization of Data with Nonparametric Models for Uncertainty","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":45,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer and Information Science and Engineering, University of Florida","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077916100","id":37077916100,"full_name":"Tushar Athawale","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science and Engineering, University of Florida"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer and Information Science and Engineering, University of Florida","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38236477800","id":38236477800,"full_name":"Elham Sakhaee","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science and Engineering, University of Florida"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer and Information Science and Engineering, University of Florida","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268675600","id":37268675600,"full_name":"Alireza Entezari","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science and Engineering, University of Florida"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The problem of isosurface extraction in uncertain data is an important research problem and may be approached in two ways. One can extract statistics (e.g., mean) from uncertain data points and visualize the extracted field. Alternatively, data uncertainty, characterized by probability distributions, can be propagated through the isosurface extraction process. We analyze the impact of data uncertainty on topology and geometry extraction algorithms. A novel, edge-crossing probability based approach is proposed to predict underlying isosurface topology for uncertain data. We derive a probabilistic version of the midpoint decider that resolves ambiguities that arise in identifying topological configurations. Moreover, the probability density function characterizing positional uncertainty in isosurfaces is derived analytically for a broad class of nonparametric distributions. This analytic characterization can be used for efficient closed-form computation of the expected value and variation in geometry. Our experiments show the computational advantages of our analytic approach over Monte-Carlo sampling for characterizing positional uncertainty. We also show the advantage of modeling underlying error densities in a nonparametric statistical framework as opposed to a parametric statistical framework through our experiments on ensemble datasets and uncertain scalar fields.","article_number":"7192629","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192629","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192629/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192629/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"777","end_page":"786","citing_paper_count":41,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":797,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty","Kernel","Isosurfaces","Random variables","Joints","Polynomials"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty quantification","linear interpolation","isosurface extraction","marching cubes","nonparametric statistics","Uncertainty quantification","linear interpolation","isosurface extraction","marching cubes","nonparametric statistics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visualization Of Isosurfaces","Monte Carlo Simulation","Monte Carlo Method","Probability Density Function","Statistical Parameters","Characterization Analysis","Non-parametric Statistics","Position Uncertainty","Localization Uncertainty","Non-parametric Distribution","Uncertain Data","Model Parameters","Random Variables","Density Estimation","Mean Data","Uniform Density","Uniform Measure","Uniform Probability Distribution","Rectangular Distribution","Nonparametric Estimation","Uncertainty Values","Localization Techniques","Kernel Estimation","Epanechnikov","Kernel Approximation","Cell Configuration","Basis Kernel","Nonparametric Density Estimation","Triangular Function","Triangle Function","Spatial Uncertainty","Adjacent Vertices","Adjacent Vertex","High-resolution Grid","Marching Cubes Algorithm","Choice Of Kernel","Edge Of The Grid","Single Kernel","Cumulative Density Function"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467201","title":"Suggested Interactivity: Seeking Perceived Affordances for Information Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":46,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"EnsadLab","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085379303","id":37085379303,"full_name":"Jeremy Boy","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["EnsadLab","INRIA","Telecom ParisTech"]}},{"affiliation":"EnsadLab","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085670986","id":37085670986,"full_name":"Louis Eveillard","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["EnsadLab"]}},{"affiliation":"Telecom ParisTech","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085659564","id":37085659564,"full_name":"Françoise Detienne","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Telecom ParisTech"]}},{"affiliation":"INRIA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407972900","id":37407972900,"full_name":"Jean-Daniel Fekete","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["INRIA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this article, we investigate methods for suggesting the interactivity of online visualizations embedded with text.

Our new techniques SpaceCast, TraceCast, and PointCast improve usability and speed of spatial selection in point clouds through novel context-aware algorithms. They are able to infer a user's subtle selection intention from gestural input, can deal with complex situations such as partially occluded point clusters or multiple cluster layers, and can all be fine-tuned after the selection interaction has been completed. Together, they provide an effective and efficient tool set for the fast exploratory analysis of large datasets. In addition to presenting Cast, we report on a formal user study that compares our new techniques not only to each other but also to existing state-of-the-art selection methods. Our results show that Cast family members are virtually always faster than existing methods without tradeoffs in accuracy. In addition, qualitative feedback shows that PointCast and TraceCast were strongly favored by our participants for intuitiveness and efficiency.","article_number":"7192726","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192726","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192726/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192726/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"886","end_page":"895","citing_paper_count":40,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1190,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three-dimensional displays","Shape","Isosurfaces","Indexes","Accuracy","Face"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Selection","spatial selection","structure-aware selection","context-aware selection","exploratory data visualization and analysis","3D interaction","user interaction","Selection","spatial selection","structure-aware selection","context-aware selection","exploratory data visualization and analysis","3D interaction","user interaction"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Interactive","Exploratory Analysis","Exploratory Data Analysis","Selection Method","User Study","Point Cloud","Selection Techniques","Usage Intention","Spatial Selectivity","F1 Score","F-measure","Small Clusters","Completion Time","Accuracy Scores","Boolean Operators","Binary Operation","Matthews Correlation Coefficient","Matthews Correlation","Isosurface","Density Field","2D Projection","Casting Method","Point R","Restriction Point","G1 Checkpoint","Casting Technique","Simple Selection","Marching Cubes Algorithm","Family Of Techniques","Task Completion Time","3D Scene","Frustum","Epanechnikov Kernel","Interaction Design","User Selection"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467971","title":"VAiRoma: A Visual Analytics System for Making Sense of Places, Times, and Events in Roman History","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":48,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"UNC Charlotte","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38236879300","id":38236879300,"full_name":"Isaac Cho","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UNC Charlotte"]}},{"affiliation":"UNC Charlotte","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606064200","id":37606064200,"full_name":"Wewnen Dou","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UNC Charlotte"]}},{"authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085741645","id":37085741645,"full_name":"Derek Xiaoyu Wang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":null}},{"authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945352600","id":37945352600,"full_name":"Eric Sauda","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":null}},{"authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300425000","id":37300425000,"full_name":"William Ribarsky","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":null}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Learning and gaining knowledge of Roman history is an area of interest for students and citizens at large. This is an example of a subject with great sweep (with many interrelated sub-topics over, in this case, a 3,000 year history) that is hard to grasp by any individual and, in its full detail, is not available as a coherent story. In this paper, we propose a visual analytics approach to construct a data driven view of Roman history based on a large collection of Wikipedia articles. Extracting and enabling the discovery of useful knowledge on events, places, times, and their connections from large amounts of textual data has always been a challenging task. To this aim, we introduce VAiRoma, a visual analytics system that couples state-of-the-art text analysis methods with an intuitive visual interface to help users make sense of events, places, times, and more importantly, the relationships between them. VAiRoma goes beyond textual content exploration, as it permits users to compare, make connections, and externalize the findings all within the visual interface. As a result, VAiRoma allows users to learn and create new knowledge regarding Roman history in an informed way. We evaluated VAiRoma with 16 participants through a user study, with the task being to learn about roman piazzas through finding relevant articles and new relationships. Our study results showed that the VAiRoma system enables the participants to find more relevant articles and connections compared to Web searches and literature search conducted in a roman library. Subjective feedback on VAiRoma was also very positive. In addition, we ran two case studies that demonstrate how VAiRoma can be used for deeper analysis, permitting the rapid discovery and analysis of a small number of key documents even when the original collection contains hundreds of thousands of documents.","article_number":"7192676","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192676","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192676/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192676/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"210","end_page":"219","citing_paper_count":39,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2147,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Encyclopedias","Electronic publishing","Internet","History","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analytics","Text Analytics","Wikipedia","Visual Analytics","Text Analytics","Wikipedia"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Sense Of Events","Visual Analytics System","Search Engine","Searchable","Web Search","Visual System","User Study","Visual Approach","Knowledge Gain","Visual Interface","Relevant Connections","Subjective Feedback","Topical","Local Area","Design Process","Time Range","Visual Representation","General Knowledge","General Cognition","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Table Entries","Web-based Interface","Web-based User Interface","Roman Empire","Top Keywords","Topic Modeling","Screen Space","Unexpected Relationship","Interactive Visualization","Source Text","Places Of Interest"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467754","title":"Visually Comparing Weather Features in Forecasts","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":49,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085624196","id":37085624196,"full_name":"P.

For this we introduce a dissimilarity measure of data projections that discards affine transformations of projections and prevents repetitions of the same data patterns. Based on this, we provide complete data tours of at most n/2 projections. Furthermore, we propose optimal paths of projection matrices for an interactive data exploration. We illustrate our technique with a set of state-of-the-art real high-dimensional benchmark datasets.","article_number":"7192684","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192684","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192684/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192684/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"609","end_page":"618","citing_paper_count":38,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1306,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Convergence","Principal component analysis","Benchmark testing","Iris","Measurement","Visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Multivariate Projections","Star Coordinates","Radial Visualization","High-dimensional Data","Multivariate Projections","Star Coordinates","Radial Visualization","High-dimensional Data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Project Data","Set Of Projects","Visual Information","Patterns In Data","Projection Matrix","Matrix Operations","Projection Matrices","Affine Transformation","High-dimensional Datasets","Dissimilarity Measure","Interactive Exploration","Data Matrix","Data Matrices","Quality Metrics","Matrix M","Matrices M","Visual Search","Visual Scanning","Visual Space","Relevant Patterns","Linear Projection","Coordinate Axis","Parameter Convergence","Maximum Deformation","Relevant Projects","Gradient Ascent","Minimal Deformation","Behavior Of Algorithm","Behaviour Of The Algorithm","Homogeneous Coordinates","Affine Function","Affine Map","Yeast Dataset","Project In Order","Optimal Projection","Degrees Of Freedom"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467813","title":"BiSet: Semantic Edge Bundling with Biclusters for Sensemaking","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":51,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073375900","id":37073375900,"full_name":"Maoyuan Sun","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38581304300","id":38581304300,"full_name":"Peng Mi","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37419565900","id":37419565900,"full_name":"Chris North","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273204200","id":37273204200,"full_name":"Naren Ramakrishnan","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Identifying coordinated relationships is an important task in data analytics. For example, an intelligence analyst might want to discover three suspicious people who all visited the same four cities. Existing techniques that display individual relationships, such as between lists of entities, require repetitious manual selection and significant mental aggregation in cluttered visualizations to find coordinated relationships. In this paper, we present BiSet, a visual analytics technique to support interactive exploration of coordinated relationships. In BiSet, we model coordinated relationships as biclusters and algorithmically mine them from a dataset. Then, we visualize the biclusters in context as bundled edges between sets of related entities. Thus, bundles enable analysts to infer task-oriented semantic insights about potentially coordinated activities. We make bundles as first class objects and add a new layer, “in-between”, to contain these bundle objects. Based on this, bundles serve to organize entities represented in lists and visually reveal their membership. Users can interact with edge bundles to organize related entities, and vice versa, for sensemaking purposes. With a usage scenario, we demonstrate how BiSet supports the exploration of coordinated relationships in text analytics.","article_number":"7192715","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192715","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192715/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192715/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"310","end_page":"319","citing_paper_count":38,"citing_patent_count":3,"download_count":1084,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Semantics","Image edge detection","Data analytics","Encoding"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Bicluster","coordinated relationship","semantic edge bundling","Bicluster","coordinated relationship","semantic edge bundling"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Edge Bundling","Text Analysis","Object Classification","Visualization Techniques","Related Entities","Usage Scenarios","Intelligence Analysts","List Of Entities","Visual Representation","Row Vector","Row Of Matrix","2D Space","Related Datasets","Individual Entities","Simple Ones","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","User Selection","Names Of People","Exploration Type","Edge Width","Group Of Entities","Parallel Coordinates","Bezier Curve","Cubic Bézier","Bézier Curves","Right Click","Left Click","Status Of Entities","State Of Entity","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Scatterplot Matrix","Scatterplot Matrices","Visual Encoding","Edge Labels","Heterogeneous Network","Network Heterogeneity","Visual Clues"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467199","title":"Visualizing Multiple Variables Across Scale and Geography","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":52,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"the giCentre, City University London","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077419200","id":37077419200,"full_name":"Sarah Goodwin","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["the giCentre, City University London","Monash University"]}},{"affiliation":"the giCentre, City University London","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37605079900","id":37605079900,"full_name":"Jason Dykes","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["the giCentre, City University London"]}},{"affiliation":"the giCentre, City University London","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590960700","id":37590960700,"full_name":"Aidan Slingsby","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["the giCentre, City University London"]}},{"affiliation":"the giCentre, City University London","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37567685600","id":37567685600,"full_name":"Cagatay Turkay","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["the giCentre, City University London"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Comparing multiple variables to select those that effectively characterize complex entities is important in a wide variety of domains - geodemographics for example. Identifying variables that correlate is a common practice to remove redundancy, but correlation varies across space, with scale and over time, and the frequently used global statistics hide potentially important differentiating local variation. For more comprehensive and robust insights into multivariate relations, these local correlations need to be assessed through various means of defining locality. We explore the geography of this issue, and use novel interactive visualization to identify interdependencies in multivariate data sets to support geographically informed multivariate analysis. We offer terminology for considering scale and locality, visual techniques for establishing the effects of scale on correlation and a theoretical framework through which variation in geographic correlation with scale and locality are addressed explicitly. Prototype software demonstrates how these contributions act together. These techniques enable multiple variables and their geographic characteristics to be considered concurrently as we extend visual parameter space analysis (vPSA) to the spatial domain. We find variable correlations to be sensitive to scale and geography to varying degrees in the context of energy-based geodemographics. This sensitivity depends upon the calculation of locality as well as the geographical and statistical structure of the variable.","article_number":"7192660","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192660","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192660/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192660/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"599","end_page":"608","citing_paper_count":37,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1594,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Correlation","Geography","Visualization","Input variables","Context","Prototypes","Spatial resolution"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Scale","Geography","Multivariate","Sensitivity Analysis","Variable Selection","Local Statistics","Geodemographics","Energy","Scale","Geography","Multivariate","Sensitivity Analysis","Variable Selection","Local Statistics","Geodemographics","Energy"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Multivariate Analysis","Multivariate Analysis Of Variance","Interactive","Local Variations","Parameter Space","Multivariate Data","Multivariate Statistics","Scale Effect","Visual Space","Global Statistics","Local Correlation","Software Prototype","Prototyping Process","Geographical Correlation","Wide Variety Of Domains","Skewness","Spatial Scales","Variable Selection","Geographic Variation","Geographic Diversity","Global Value","Local Heat","Central Heating","Electricity Consumption","Definition Of Types","Global Correlation","Gas Consumption","Geographic Effects","Geographic Events","Geographic Analysis","Fuel Poverty","Visual Design","Multivariate Comparisons","Modifiable Areal Unit Problem","Asymmetric Matrix","Asymmetric Matrices","Variable Selection Process"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467759","title":"Guidelines for Effective Usage of Text Highlighting Techniques","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":53,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Harvard University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38108845300","id":38108845300,"full_name":"Hendrik Strobelt","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University"]}},{"affiliation":"Siemens AG, DIPF","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591207400","id":37591207400,"full_name":"Daniela Oelke","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Siemens AG, DIPF"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085677185","id":37085677185,"full_name":"Bum Chul Kwon","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Graz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282557600","id":37282557600,"full_name":"Tobias Schreck","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Graz"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275698100","id":37275698100,"full_name":"Hanspeter Pfister","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Semi-automatic text analysis involves manual inspection of text.

Also, many advanced techniques for visualization and highlighting of text exist; yet, standard typesetting is common, and the effects of standard typesetting on the perception of text are not fully understood. As such, we surveyed and tested the effectiveness of common text highlighting techniques, both individually and in combination, to discover how to maximize pop-out effects while minimizing visual interference between techniques. To validate our findings, we conducted a series of crowd-sourced experiments to determine: i) a ranking of nine commonly-used text highlighting techniques; ii) the degree of visual interference between pairs of text highlighting techniques; iii) the effectiveness of techniques for visual conjunctive search. Our results show that increasing font size works best as a single highlighting technique, and that there are significant visual interferences between some pairs of highlighting techniques.

The true value of computation to close reading is still very much an open question. During a two-year design study, we explored this question with several poetry scholars, focusing on an investigation of sound and linguistic devices in poetry. The contributions of our design study include a problem characterization and data abstraction of the use of sound in poetry as well as Poemage, a visualization tool for interactively exploring the sonic topology of a poem. The design of Poemage is grounded in the evaluation of a series of technology probes we deployed to our poetry collaborators, and we validate the final design with several case studies that illustrate the disruptive impact technology can have on poetry scholarship.

To inspect the local and individual diffusion tensors, glyph-based visualizations are commonly used since they are able to effectively convey full aspects of the diffusion tensor. For several applications it is necessary to compare tensor fields, e.g., to study the effects of acquisition parameters, or to investigate the influence of pathologies on white matter structures. This comparison is commonly done by extracting scalar information out of the tensor fields and then comparing these scalar fields, which leads to a loss of information. If the glyph representation is kept, simple juxtaposition or superposition can be used. However, neither facilitates the identification and interpretation of the differences between the tensor fields. Inspired by the checkerboard style visualization and the superquadric tensor glyph, we design a new glyph to locally visualize differences between two diffusion tensors by combining juxtaposition and explicit encoding. Because tensor scale, anisotropy type, and orientation are related to anatomical information relevant for DTI applications, we focus on visualizing tensor differences in these three aspects. As demonstrated in a user study, our new glyph design allows users to efficiently and effectively identify the tensor differences. We also apply our new glyphs to investigate the differences between DTI datasets of the human brain in two different contexts using different b-values, and to compare datasets from a healthy and HIV-infected subject.","article_number":"7192722","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192722","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192722/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192722/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"797","end_page":"806","citing_paper_count":34,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1706,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Tensile stress","Visualization","Shape","Diffusion tensor imaging","Encoding","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Glyph Design","Comparative Visualization","Diffusion Tensor Field","Glyph Design","Comparative Visualization","Diffusion Tensor Field"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Diffusion Tensor Imaging","Diffusion-weighted Imaging","Diffusion Tensor","Diffusion Tensor Field","White Matter","User Study","HIV-infected Subjects","Eigenvalues","Feature Space","Corpus Callosum","Callose","Differences In Perception","Differences In Preferences","Differences In Orientation","Multiple Datasets","Multivariate Data","Multivariate Statistics","Differences In Shape","Visual Comparison","Differences In Scale","Frobenius Norm","Open Angle","Individual Scale","Dissimilarity Measure","Scalar Value","Symmetric Tensor","Scale Of Diffusion","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Rotation Invariance","White Rectangle","Occlusion Problem","Visual Channels","Comparable Accuracy","Accurate Comparison","Oblique View","Color Map"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467203","title":"Cluster Analysis of Vortical Flow in Simulations of Cerebral Aneurysm Hemodynamics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":56,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Simulation and Graphics, University of Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085591751","id":37085591751,"full_name":"Steffen Oeltze-Jafra","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Simulation and Graphics, University of Magdeburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Center for Computational Fluid Dynamics, George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37285144200","id":37285144200,"full_name":"Juan R.

We present a clustering-based approach for the visual analysis of vortical flow in simulated cerebral aneurysm hemodynamics.

Feature extraction and tracking are two important tasks scientists rely upon to get insights about the dynamic nature of the large scale time-varying data. However, often the complexity of the scientific phenomena only allows scientists to vaguely define their feature of interest. Furthermore, such features can have varying motion patterns and dynamic evolution over time. As a result, automatic extraction and tracking of features becomes a non-trivial task. In this work, we investigate these issues and propose a distribution driven approach which allows us to construct novel algorithms for reliable feature extraction and tracking with high confidence in the absence of accurate feature definition. We exploit two key properties of an object, motion and similarity to the target feature, and fuse the information gained from them to generate a robust feature-aware classification field at every time step. Tracking of features is done using such classified fields which enhances the accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated by successfully applying it on several scientific data sets containing a wide range of dynamic time-varying features.","article_number":"7192664","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192664","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192664/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192664/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"837","end_page":"846","citing_paper_count":33,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1191,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Feature extraction","Target tracking","Data models","Estimation","Computational modeling","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Gaussian mixture model (GMM)","Incremental learning","Feature extraction and tracking","Time-varying data analysis","Gaussian mixture model (GMM)","Incremental learning","Feature extraction and tracking","Time-varying data analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Feature Tracking","Time-varying Data","Time Step","Characteristics Of Data","Features Of Data","Interesting Feature","Interesting Characteristics","Target Features","Target Characteristics","Tracking Algorithm","Definition Of Features","Definition Of Characteristics","Time-varying Characteristics","Time-varying Features","Absence Of Definition","Science Datasets","Scientific Data Sets","Mixture Model","Gaussian Mixture","Regional Data","Final Classification","Final Category","Dataset Characteristics","Dataset Features","Precise Definition","Gaussian Mixture Model","Precise Description","Part Features","Partial Characteristics","Use Of Distribution","Temporal Coherence","3D Flow","Current Time Step","Feature Merging","Vortex Core","Data Block","Existence Of Features","Tornado","Automatic Tracking","Weather Research And Forecasting"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2468291","title":"3D Regression Heat Map Analysis of Population Study Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":58,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085590408","id":37085590408,"full_name":"Paul Klemm","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085527253","id":37085527253,"full_name":"Kai Lawonn","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands","Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087203593","id":37087203593,"full_name":"Sylvia Glaßer","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37076923700","id":37076923700,"full_name":"Uli Niemann","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Ernst-Moritz-Arndt University Greifswald, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085591817","id":37085591817,"full_name":"Katrin Hegenscheid","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Ernst-Moritz-Arndt University Greifswald, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Ernst-Moritz-Arndt University Greifswald, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37889186600","id":37889186600,"full_name":"Henry Völzke","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Ernst-Moritz-Arndt University Greifswald, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37424645300","id":37424645300,"full_name":"Bernhard Preim","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Epidemiological studies comprise heterogeneous data about a subject group to define disease-specific risk factors. These data contain information (features) about a subject's lifestyle, medical status as well as medical image data. Statistical regression analysis is used to evaluate these features and to identify feature combinations indicating a disease (the target feature). We propose an analysis approach of epidemiological data sets by incorporating all features in an exhaustive regression-based analysis. This approach combines all independent features w.r.t. a target feature. It provides a visualization that reveals insights into the data by highlighting relationships. The 3D Regression Heat Map, a novel 3D visual encoding, acts as an overview of the whole data set. It shows all combinations of two to three independent features with a specific target disease. Slicing through the 3D Regression Heat Map allows for the detailed analysis of the underlying relationships. Expert knowledge about disease-specific hypotheses can be included into the analysis by adjusting the regression model formulas. Furthermore, the influences of features can be assessed using a difference view comparing different calculation results. We applied our 3D Regression Heat Map method to a hepatic steatosis data set to reproduce results from a data mining-driven analysis. A qualitative analysis was conducted on a breast density data set. We were able to derive new hypotheses about relations between breast density and breast lesions with breast cancer.

However, real service usually deviates from the plan. Therefore, transportation analysts need to identify, compare and explain both eventual and systemic performance issues that must be addressed so that better timetables can be created. The purely statistical tools commonly used by analysts pose many difficulties due to the large number of attributes at tripand station-level for planned and real service. Also challenging is the need for models at multiple scales to search for patterns at different times and stations, since analysts do not know exactly where or when relevant patterns might emerge and need to compute statistical summaries for multiple attributes at different granularities. To aid in this analysis, we worked in close collaboration with a transportation expert to design TR-EX, a visual exploration tool developed to identify, inspect and compare spatio-temporal patterns for planned and real transportation service. TR-EX combines two new visual encodings inspired by Marey's Train Schedule: Trips Explorer for trip-level analysis of frequency, deviation and speed; and Stops Explorer for station-level study of delay, wait time, reliability and performance deficiencies such as bunching. To tackle overplotting and to provide a robust representation for a large numbers of trips and stops at multiple scales, the system supports variable kernel bandwidths to achieve the level of detail required by users for different tasks. We justify our design decisions based on specific analysis needs of transportation analysts. We provide anecdotal evidence of the efficacy of TR-EX through a series of case studies that explore NYC subway service, which illustrate how TR-EX can be used to confirm hypotheses and derive new insights through visual exploration.","article_number":"7192706","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192706","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192706/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192706/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"170","end_page":"179","citing_paper_count":32,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1610,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Schedules","Visualization","Bandwidth","Public transportation","Delays","Kernel"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Transportation","schedules","kernel density estimation","visual exploration","Transportation","schedules","kernel density estimation","visual exploration"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Exploration","Service Quality","Waiting Time","Transport Services","Training Schedule","Series Of Case Studies","Real Service","Visual Representation","Density Estimation","Problem Of Data","Service Activities","Stopping Rule","Stopping Time","Interactive Visualization","Headway","Scalar Value","Peak Hours","Polyline","Region C","Different Levels Of Detail","Subway Line","Parallel Coordinates","Interface Elements","User Interface Elements","Station Level","Cluttering","Transit Service","Transportation Agencies","Transit Routes","Horizontal Axis","Real-time Data"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467441","title":"NeuroBlocks – Visual Tracking of Segmentation and Proofreading for Large Connectomics Projects","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":62,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085695219","id":37085695219,"full_name":"Ali K.

However, the segmentation process of a single volume is very complex, time-intensive, and usually performed using a diverse set of tools and many users. To tackle the associated challenges, this paper presents NeuroBlocks, which is a novel visualization system for tracking the state, progress, and evolution of very large volumetric segmentation data in neuroscience. NeuroBlocks is a multi-user web-based application that seamlessly integrates the diverse set of tools that neuroscientists currently use for manual and semi-automatic segmentation, proofreading, visualization, and analysis. NeuroBlocks is the first system that integrates this heterogeneous tool set, providing crucial support for the management, provenance, accountability, and auditing of large-scale segmentations. We describe the design of NeuroBlocks, starting with an analysis of the domain-specific tasks, their inherent challenges, and our subsequent task abstraction and visual representation.

Ensembles are large, temporal, multidimensional, and multivariate, making them difficult to analyze. Another important challenge is visualizing ensembles that vary both in space and time. Initial visualization techniques displayed ensembles with a small number of members, or presented an overview of an entire ensemble, but without potentially important details. Recently, researchers have suggested combining these two directions, allowing users to choose subsets of members to visualization. This manual selection process places the burden on the user to identify which members to explore. We first introduce a static ensemble visualization system that automatically helps users locate interesting subsets of members to visualize. We next extend the system to support analysis and visualization of temporal ensembles. We employ 3D shape comparison, cluster tree visualization, and glyph based visualization to represent different levels of detail within an ensemble. This strategy is used to provide two approaches for temporal ensemble analysis: (1) segment based ensemble analysis, to capture important shape transition time-steps, clusters groups of similar members, and identify common shape changes over time across multiple members; and (2) time-step based ensemble analysis, which assumes ensemble members are aligned in time by combining similar shapes at common time-steps. Both approaches enable users to interactively visualize and analyze a temporal ensemble from different perspectives at different levels of detail. We demonstrate our techniques on an ensemble studying matter transition from hadronic gas to quark-gluon plasma during gold-on-gold particle collisions.","article_number":"7194852","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194852","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7194852/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7194852/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"787","end_page":"796","citing_paper_count":31,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1351,"insert_date":"20150813","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Shape","Data visualization","Visualization","Octrees","Three-dimensional displays","Shape measurement","Data mining"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Ensemble visualization","Ensemble visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Temporal Ensembling","Shape Changes","Similar Shape","Similar Figure","Similar Geometry","Temporal Analysis","Multiple Members","Visualization Techniques","Clustering Tree","Ensemble Members","Particle Collisions","Ensemble Analysis","Different Levels Of Detail","Common Shape","Subset Of Members","Quark-gluon Plasma","Small Number Of Members","Temporal Dimension","Time Dimension","Temporal Properties","Clustering Results","Data Elements","Segmentation Results","Hierarchical Relationships","Clustering Segmentation","Pattern Mining","Dynamic Time Warping","Set Membership","Member Of The Pair","Member Of Each Pair","Cluster Shape","Dissimilarity Matrix","Dissimilarity Matrices","Segmentation Quality","Quantum Chromodynamics","Parallel Coordinates"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467432","title":"Interstitial and Interlayer Ion Diffusion Geometry Extraction in Graphitic Nanosphere Battery Materials","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":64,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37870001700","id":37870001700,"full_name":"Attila Gyulassy","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SCI Institute, University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37692671900","id":37692671900,"full_name":"Aaron Knoll","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SCI Institute, University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"Materials Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085726305","id":37085726305,"full_name":"Kah Chun Lau","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Materials Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38025846900","id":38025846900,"full_name":"Bei Wang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SCI Institute, University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564112000","id":37564112000,"full_name":"Peer-Timo Bremer","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"Materials Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267817200","id":37267817200,"full_name":"Michael E.

A good battery anode material is determined by its capacity to store ion or other diffusers. However, modeling of ion diffusion dynamics and transport properties at large length and long time scales would be impossible with current MD codes. To analyze the fundamental properties of these materials, therefore, we turn to geometric and topological analysis of their structure. In this paper, we apply a novel technique inspired by discrete Morse theory to the Delaunay triangulation of the simulated geometry of a thermally annealed carbon nanosphere. We utilize our computed structures to drive further geometric analysis to extract the interstitial diffusion structure as a single mesh. Our results provide a new approach to analyze the geometry of the simulated carbon nanosphere, and new insights into the role of carbon defect size and distribution in determining the charge capacity and charge dynamics of these carbon based battery materials.","article_number":"7192674","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192674","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192674/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192674/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"916","end_page":"925","citing_paper_count":30,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":547,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Carbon","Lithium","Computational modeling","Discrete Fourier transforms","Geometry","Batteries","Shape"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["materials science","morse-smale","topology","Delaunay","computational geometry","materials science","morse-smale","topology","Delaunay","computational geometry"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Ion Diffusion","Materials For Batteries","Interstitial Diffusion","Interlayer Diffusion","Molecular Dynamics","Molecular Dynamics Simulations","Topological Analysis","Thermal Annealing","Anode Materials","Geometric Analysis","Charge Capacity","Delaunay Triangulation","Battery Anode","Carbon Nanospheres","Large-scale Molecular Dynamics","Carbon Atoms","Critical Point","Density Functional Theory","Free Surface","Interstitial Space","Alpha Shape","Α-shape","Lithium Diffusion","Voronoi Diagram","Voronoi Tessellation","Voronoi Cell","Classical Dynamics","Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics","Free Diffusion","Diffusion Path","Stable Manifold","Simplicial Complex","Discrete Field"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467611","title":"SensePath: Understanding the Sensemaking Process Through Analytic Provenance","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":65,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Middlesex University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490354300","id":38490354300,"full_name":"Phong H.

Understanding the sensemaking process allows building effective visual analytics tools to make sense of large and complex datasets. Currently, it is often a manual and time-consuming undertaking to comprehend this: researchers collect observation data, transcribe screen capture videos and think-aloud recordings, identify recurring patterns, and eventually abstract the sensemaking process into a general model. In this paper, we propose a general approach to facilitate such a qualitative analysis process, and introduce a prototype, SensePath, to demonstrate the application of this approach with a focus on browser-based online sensemaking. The approach is based on a study of a number of qualitative research sessions including observations of users performing sensemaking tasks and post hoc analyses to uncover their sensemaking processes. Based on the study results and a follow-up participatory design session with HCI researchers, we decided to focus on the transcription and coding stages of thematic analysis. SensePath automatically captures user's sensemaking actions, i.e., analytic provenance, and provides multi-linked views to support their further analysis. A number of other requirements elicited from the design session are also implemented in SensePath, such as easy integration with existing qualitative analysis workflow and non-intrusive for participants. The tool was used by an experienced HCI researcher to analyze two sensemaking sessions. The researcher found the tool intuitive and considerably reduced analysis time, allowing better understanding of the sensemaking process.","article_number":"7194834","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194834","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7194834/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7194834/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"41","end_page":"50","citing_paper_count":28,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1327,"insert_date":"20150813","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Human computer interaction","Visual analytics","Context","Encoding","Manuals","Web pages"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Sensemaking","analytic provenance","transcription","coding","qualitative research","timeline visualization","Sensemaking","analytic provenance","transcription","coding","qualitative research","timeline visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Sense-making Process","Qualitative Analysis","Qualitative Data Analysis","Qualitative Research","Thematic Analysis","Observational Data","General Approach","Visual Analysis","Active Users","Qualitative Process","Reduce Analysis Time","Screen Capture","Visual Analytics Tool","Interactive","Activity Time","Qualitative Methods","Qualitative Methodology","Qualitative Research Methods","Web Server","Visual System","Video Recordings","Web Page","Set Of Observations","Browser Views","Type Of Action","Google Maps","Zoom Level","Think-aloud Protocols","Audio Data","Audio Samples","Observational Data Collection","Mouse Click","Video Data","Manual Method"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467452","title":"Speculative Practices: Utilizing InfoVis to Explore Untapped Literary Collections","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":66,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"SACHI Group, University of St Andrews, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869968000","id":37869968000,"full_name":"Uta Hinrichs","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SACHI Group, University of St Andrews, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of English, University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085709173","id":37085709173,"full_name":"Stefania Forlini","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of English, University of Calgary"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of English, University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085700622","id":37085700622,"full_name":"Bridget Moynihan","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of English, University of Calgary"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this paper we exemplify how information visualization supports speculative thinking, hypotheses testing, and preliminary interpretation processes as part of literary research.

From an InfoVis perspective, we lack case studies that show the specific design challenges that make literary studies and humanities research at large a unique application area for information visualization. We examine these questions through our case study of the Speculative W@nderverse, a visualization tool that was designed to enable the analysis and exploration of an untapped literary collection consisting of thousands of science fiction short stories. We present the results of two empirical studies that involved general-interest readers and literary scholars who used the evolving visualization prototype as part of their research for over a year. Our findings suggest a design space for visualizing literary collections that is defined by (1) their academic and public relevance, (2) the tension between qualitative vs. quantitative methods of interpretation, (3) result-vs. process-driven approaches to InfoVis, and (4) the unique material and visual qualities of cultural collections. Through the Speculative W@nderverse we demonstrate how visualization can bridge these sometimes contradictory perspectives by cultivating curiosity and providing entry points into literary collections while, at the same time, supporting multiple aspects of humanities research processes.","article_number":"7192666","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192666","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192666/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192666/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"429","end_page":"438","citing_paper_count":28,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1073,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Context","Cultural differences","Statistical analysis","Data visualization","Fans","Metadata"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Digital Humanities","Interlinked Visualization","Literary Studies","Cultural Collections","Science Fiction","Digital Humanities","Interlinked Visualization","Literary Studies","Cultural Collections","Science Fiction"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Literary Collections","Empirical Studies","Studies In The Literature","Research Process","Academic Literature","Scholarly Literature","Academic Publications","Research Literature","Research Approach","Visual Information","Visualization Tool","Traditional Research","Material Quality","Design Space","Visual Quality","Interpretive Approach","Science Fiction","Unique Material","Digital Humanities","Digital Humanitarianism","Quantitative Analysis","Qualitative Interpretation","Initial Research Questions","Archival Work","Interpretation Of Space","Female Authors","Cloud Data","Word Cloud","Public Audience","Humanities Scholars","Academic Audience","General Interest"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467991","title":"Exploring Evolving Media Discourse Through Event Cueing","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":67,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Arizona State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085342409","id":37085342409,"full_name":"Yafeng Lu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085720353","id":37085720353,"full_name":"Michael Steptoe","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085731541","id":37085731541,"full_name":"Sarah Burke","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085731911","id":37085731911,"full_name":"Hong Wang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085720427","id":37085720427,"full_name":"Jiun-Yi Tsai","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267372500","id":37267372500,"full_name":"Hasan Davulcu","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37285077400","id":37285077400,"full_name":"Douglas Montgomery","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Arizona State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38014884900","id":38014884900,"full_name":"Steven R.

Underlying these documents is the concept of framing, a process in which communicators act (consciously or unconsciously) to construct a point of view that encourages facts to be interpreted by others in a particular manner. As media discourse evolves, how topics and documents are framed can undergo change, shifting the discussion to different viewpoints or rhetoric. What causes these shifts can be difficult to determine directly; however, by linking secondary datasets and enabling visual exploration, we can enhance the hypothesis generation process. In this paper, we present a visual analytics framework for event cueing using media data. As discourse develops over time, our framework applies a time series intervention model which tests to see if the level of framing is different before or after a given date. If the model indicates that the times before and after are statistically significantly different, this cues an analyst to explore related datasets to help enhance their understanding of what (if any) events may have triggered these changes in discourse. Our framework consists of entity extraction and sentiment analysis as lenses for data exploration and uses two different models for intervention analysis. To demonstrate the usage of our framework, we present a case study on exploring potential relationships between climate change framing and conflicts in Africa.","article_number":"7192705","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192705","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192705/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192705/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"220","end_page":"229","citing_paper_count":28,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1220,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Media","Time series analysis","Visual analytics","Lenses","Meteorology","Analytical models","Climate change"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Media Analysis","Time Series Analysis","Event Detection","Media Analysis","Time Series Analysis","Event Detection"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Media Discourse","Media Discussions","Climate Change","Time Series","Treatment Model","Intervention Model","Visual Analysis","Exploratory Data","Sentiment Analysis","Sentiment Classification","Online News","Named Entity Recognition","Entity Extraction","Visual Framework","Conflicts In Africa","Effects Of Climate Change","Impacts Of Climate Change","Social Movements","Event Detection","News Articles","Detailed View","Anomaly Detection","Interactive Visualization","Effects Of Conflict","Consequences Of Conflict","Conflict Events","Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average","ARIMAX","ARIMA","Change In Frame","Number Of Sentences","Multi-source Data","Causes Of Climate Change","Anthropogenic Global Warming","Cause Of Global Warming","Boko Haram","Ongoing Events","Ongoing Effects","Ongoing Consequences","Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation","APEC","Autoimmune Polyendocrine Syndrome Type 1","Autoimmune Polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal Dystrophy","Input Time Series","Positive Sentiment","Choropleth Maps"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467961","title":"Occlusion-free Blood Flow Animation with Wall Thickness Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":68,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085527253","id":37085527253,"full_name":"Kai Lawonn","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Magdeburg, Germany","Research Campus STIMULATE","Inria, France","TU Delft, Netherlands"]}},{"affiliation":"Research Campus STIMULATE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087203593","id":37087203593,"full_name":"Sylvia Glaßer","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Research Campus STIMULATE","University of Magdeburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Delft, Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282551500","id":37282551500,"full_name":"Anna Vilanova","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Delft, Netherlands"]}},{"affiliation":"Research Campus STIMULATE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37424645300","id":37424645300,"full_name":"Bernhard Preim","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Research Campus STIMULATE","University of Magdeburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Inria, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37297057400","id":37297057400,"full_name":"Tobias Isenberg","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Inria, France"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present the first visualization tool that combines pathlines from blood flow and wall thickness information.

Therefore, to get a fully informed decision it is essential to both investigate the vessel morphology and the hemodynamic data. Ongoing research emphasizes the importance of analyzing the wall thickness in risk assessment. Our combination of blood flow visualization and wall thickness representation is a significant improvement for the exploration and analysis of aneurysms. As all presented information is spatially intertwined, occlusion problems occur. We solve these occlusion problems by dynamic cutaway surfaces. We combine this approach with a glyph-based blood flow representation and a visual mapping of wall thickness onto the vessel surface. We developed a GPU-based implementation of our visualizations which facilitates wall thickness analysis through real-time rendering and flexible interactive data exploration mechanisms.

Improvements to these pipeline techniques, especially for orthogonal-style layout, are difficult and practical results have been slight in recent years. Yet, as discussed in this paper, there remain significant issues in the quality of the layouts produced by these techniques, even for quite small networks. This is especially true when layout with additional grouping constraints is required. The first contribution of this paper is to investigate an ultra-compact, grid-like network layout aesthetic that is motivated by the grid arrangements that are used almost universally by designers in typographical layout. Since the time when these heuristic and pipeline-based graph-layout methods were conceived, generic technologies (MIP, CP and SAT) for solving combinatorial and mixed-integer optimization problems have improved massively. The second contribution of this paper is to reassess whether these techniques can be used for high-quality layout of small graphs. While they are fast enough for graphs of up to 50 nodes we found these methods do not scale up. Our third contribution is a large-neighborhood search meta-heuristic approach that is scalable to larger networks.","article_number":"7192733","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192733","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192733/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192733/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"339","end_page":"348","citing_paper_count":26,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":997,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Layout","Encoding","Optimization","Containers","Standards","Routing","Pipelines"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Network visualization","graph drawing","power graph","optimization","large-neighborhood search","Network visualization","graph drawing","power graph","optimization","large-neighborhood search"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Grid Layout","Heuristic","Rule Of Thumb","Optimization Problem","Contributions Of This Paper","Optimal Combination","Additional Constraints","Mixed-integer Programming","Combinatorial Optimization Problem","Metaheuristic Approaches","Graph Layout","Graph Drawing","Network Layout","Shortest Path","Proper Technique","General Techniques","Simulated Annealing","Small Domain","Node Positions","Location Of Nodes","Leaf Node","Constrained Optimization","Optimization Constraints","Constrained Minimization","Constraint Programming","Disjunction","Layout Optimization","Group Of Nodes","Edge Segmentation","Edge Path","End Nodes","Boolean Variable","Boolean Value","Boolean Matrix","Boolean Matrices","Start Node"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467951","title":"A Psychophysical Investigation of Size as a Physical Variable","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":71,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Copenhagen","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37076983200","id":37076983200,"full_name":"Yvonne Jansen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Copenhagen"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Copenhagen","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38201832000","id":38201832000,"full_name":"Kasper Hornbæk","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Copenhagen"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Physical visualizations, or data physicalizations, encode data in attributes of physical shapes. Despite a considerable body of work on visual variables, “physical variables” remain poorly understood. One of them is physical size. A difficulty for solid elements is that “size” is ambiguous - it can refer to either length/diameter, surface, or volume. Thus, it is unclear for designers of physicalizations how to effectively encode quantities in physical size. To investigate, we ran an experiment where participants estimated ratios between quantities represented by solid bars and spheres. Our results suggest that solid bars are compared based on their length, consistent with previous findings for 2D and 3D bars on flat media. But for spheres, participants' estimates are rather proportional to their surface. Depending on the estimation method used, judgments are rather consistent across participants, thus the use of perceptually-optimized size scales seems possible. We conclude by discussing implications for the design of data physicalizations and the need for more empirical studies on physical variables.","article_number":"7194845","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194845","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7194845/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7194845/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"479","end_page":"488","citing_paper_count":26,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":943,"insert_date":"20150813","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Brushes","Visualization","Data visualization","Clutter","Histograms","Data structures","Kernel"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data physicalization","Physical visualization","Psychophysics","Experiment","Data physicalization","physical visualization","psychophysics","experiment","physical variable"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Physical Variables","Estimation Method","Approximation Method","Physicalism","Solid Bars","Error Rate","Exponent","Power-law","Scaling Law","Response Curves","3D Printing","Logistic Function","Logistic Growth","Logistic Curve","Ratio Estimates","Zero-sum","Zero-sum Game","Psychophysics","Physical Stimuli","Physical Stimulus","Large Body Of Work","Laser Cutting","Visual Domain","Sphere Size","Spherical Volume","Correct Scale","Physical Markers","Physical Representation","Active Touch","Visual Encoding","Visual Perception","Physical Body","Physical Objects","Physical Form","Physical Entities","Line-of-sight","Perception Studies","Nonlinear Model","Typical Shape"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2466971","title":"Matches, Mismatches, and Methods: Multiple-View Workflows for Energy Portfolio Analysis","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":72,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of British Columbia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37719161300","id":37719161300,"full_name":"Matthew Brehmer","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of British Columbia"]}},{"affiliation":"EnerNOC, Inc.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085722095","id":37085722095,"full_name":"Jocelyn Ng","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["EnerNOC, Inc."]}},{"affiliation":"EnerNOC, Inc.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085728320","id":37085728320,"full_name":"Kevin Tate","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["EnerNOC, Inc."]}},{"affiliation":"University of British Columbia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349490300","id":37349490300,"full_name":"Tamara Munzner","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of British Columbia"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The energy performance of large building portfolios is challenging to analyze and monitor, as current analysis tools are not scalable or they present derived and aggregated data at too coarse of a level.

To facilitate healthy and lively conversations in these communities, their members should be continuously monitored and nurtured by OHC administrators. The main challenge of OHC administrators' tasks lies in understanding the diverse dimensions of conversation threads that lead to productive discussions in their communities. In this paper, we present a design study in which three domain expert groups participated, an OHC researcher and two OHC administrators of online health communities, which was conducted to find with a visual analytic solution. Through our design study, we characterized the domain goals of OHC administrators and derived tasks to achieve these goals. As a result of this study, we propose a system called VisOHC, which visualizes individual OHC conversation threads as collapsed boxes-a visual metaphor of conversation threads. In addition, we augmented the posters' reply authorship network with marks and/or beams to show conversation dynamics within threads. We also developed unique measures tailored to the characteristics of OHCs, which can be encoded for thread visualizations at the users' requests. Our observation of the two administrators while using VisOHC showed that it supports their tasks and reveals interesting insights into online health communities. Finally, we share our methodological lessons on probing visual designs together with domain experts by allowing them to freely encode measurements into visual variables.","article_number":"7192683","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192683","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192683/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192683/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"71","end_page":"80","citing_paper_count":26,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":1637,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Message systems","Atmospheric measurements","Particle measurements","Visual analytics","Prototypes","Market research"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Online health communities","visual analytics","conversation analysis","thread visualization","healthcare,","design study,","Online health communities","visual analytics","conversation analysis","thread visualization","healthcare","design study"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Online Health Communities","Domain Experts","Visual Design","Visual Metaphors","Prototype","Topical","Personal Experiences","Online Communities","Online Discussion","Computer-mediated Communication","Cloud Data","Word Cloud","Topic Modeling","Personal Stories","Hibernation","Similar Views","Negative Sentiment","Term Frequency-inverse Document Frequency","Inverse Document Frequency","TF-IDF","Type Of Discourse","Discussion Of Types","Personality Scores","Sentiment Scores","Converse Pattern","Patterns Of Conversion","Anomaly Score","Discussion Threads","Personal Voice","Colored Boxes","Visual Analytics Tool","Named Entity Recognition","Entity Extraction","Workflow","Social Media","Social Platforms","Types Of Information"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467620","title":"Interactive Visual Profiling of Musicians","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":74,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Image and Signal Processing Group, Leipzig University, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38243241100","id":38243241100,"full_name":"Stefan Jänicke","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Image and Signal Processing Group, Leipzig University, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Museum of Musical Instruments, Leipzig University, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085693075","id":37085693075,"full_name":"Josef Focht","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Museum of Musical Instruments, Leipzig University, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Image and Signal Processing Group, Leipzig University, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282574800","id":37282574800,"full_name":"Gerik Scheuermann","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Image and Signal Processing Group, Leipzig University, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Determining similar objects based upon the features of an object of interest is a common task for visual analytics systems.

However, working with human motion tracking data to support such analysis poses great challenges. In this paper, we propose MotionFlow, a visual analytics system that provides an effective overview of various motion patterns based on an interactive flow visualization. This visualization formulates a motion sequence as transitions between static poses, and aggregates these sequences into a tree diagram to construct a set of motion patterns. The system also allows the users to directly reflect the context of data and their perception of pose similarities in generating representative pose states. We provide local and global controls over the partition-based clustering process. To support the users in organizing unstructured motion data into pattern groups, we designed a set of interactions that enables searching for similar motion sequences from the data, detailed exploration of data subsets, and creating and modifying the group of motion patterns. To evaluate the usability of MotionFlow, we conducted a user study with six researchers with expertise in gesture-based interaction design. They used MotionFlow to explore and organize unstructured motion tracking data. Results show that the researchers were able to easily learn how to use MotionFlow, and the system effectively supported their pattern analysis activities, including leveraging their perception and domain knowledge.","article_number":"7194831","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194831","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7194831/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7194831/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"21","end_page":"30","citing_paper_count":24,"citing_patent_count":3,"download_count":1781,"insert_date":"20150813","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Tracking","Pattern analysis","Visualization","Context","Layout","Three-dimensional displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Human motion visualization","interactive clustering","motion tracking data","expert reviews","user study","Human motion visualization","interactive clustering","motion tracking data","expert reviews","user study"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Human Data","Sequence Patterns","Human Motion","Flow Motion","Visual Abstract","Motion Tracking Data","Cognitive Domains","Domain Knowledge","Pattern Analysis","Motion Analysis","Motion Patterns","Clustering Process","Interactive Visualization","Perceptual Similarity","Motion Data","Similar Motion","Flow Visualization","Motion Sequences","Overview Of Patterns","Hierarchical Clustering","Hierarchical Cluster Analysis","Transition State","Interaction Techniques","Multiple Motion","Human Gestures","Human Pose","Tree Visualization","Visual Design","Overview Of Data","Visual Encoding","Leaf Node","Edge Width"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467872","title":"Orientation-Enhanced Parallel Coordinate Plots","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":76,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Eindhoven University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085466510","id":37085466510,"full_name":"Renata Georgia Raidou","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology","Delft University of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"TH Köln","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546817000","id":37546817000,"full_name":"Martin Eisemann","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TH Köln","Delft University of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Eindhoven University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37374875300","id":37374875300,"full_name":"Marcel Breeuwer","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology","Philips Healthcare"]}},{"affiliation":"Delft University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37829332900","id":37829332900,"full_name":"Elmar Eisemann","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Delft University of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Delft University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282551500","id":37282551500,"full_name":"Anna Vilanova","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Delft University of Technology"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Parallel Coordinate Plots (PCPs) is one of the most powerful techniques for the visualization of multivariate data.

We propose a new and simple technique to improve the display of PCPs by emphasizing the underlying data structure. Our Orientation-enhanced Parallel Coordinate Plots (OPCPs) improve pattern and outlier discernibility by visually enhancing parts of each PCP polyline with respect to its slope. This enhancement also allows us to introduce a novel and efficient selection method, the Orientation-enhanced Brushing (O-Brushing). Our solution is particularly useful when multiple patterns are present or when the view on certain patterns is obstructed by noise. We present the results of our approach with several synthetic and real-world datasets. Finally, we conducted a user evaluation, which verifies the advantages of the OPCPs in terms of discernibility of information in complex data. It also confirms that O-Brushing eases the selection of data patterns in PCPs and reduces the amount of necessary user interactions compared to state-of-the-art brushing techniques.","article_number":"7192696","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192696","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192696/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192696/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"589","end_page":"598","citing_paper_count":24,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":907,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Brushes","Visualization","Data visualization","Clutter","Histograms","Data structures","Kernel"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Parallel Coordinates","Orientation-enhanced Parallel Coordinates","Brushing","Orientation-enhanced Brushing","Data Readability","Data Selection","Parallel Coordinates","Orientation-enhanced Parallel Coordinates","Brushing","Orientation-enhanced Brushing","Data Readability","Data Selection"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Parallel Coordinates","Parallel Coordinates Plot","Data Structure","Complex Data","Patterns In Data","Multivariate Data","Multivariate Statistics","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Usability Evaluation","Usability Ratings","Polyline","Tukey HSD","Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference","Related Data","Transfer Function","Dimensional Data","Identification Of Patterns","Density Data","Storage Density","Trends Data","Small Segments","Third Dimension","Outlier Data","Interactive Tool","Visual Enhancement","Gamma Correction","Histogram Equalization","Interpretation Of Patterns","Identification Of Outliers","Separate Representations","Tukey HSD Test","Structure Selection","User Performance"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467434","title":"AnimoAminoMiner: Exploration of Protein Tunnels and their Properties in Molecular Dynamics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":77,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Masaryk University, Czech Republic","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085717963","id":37085717963,"full_name":"Jan Byška","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Masaryk University, Czech Republic"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Wien, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085341875","id":37085341875,"full_name":"Mathieu Le Muzic","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Wien, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Bergen, Norway","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282552200","id":37282552200,"full_name":"M.

The method shows the detailed tunnel profile and its temporal aggregation. The profile is interactively linked with a visual overview of all amino acids which are lining the tunnel over time. In this overview, each amino acid is represented by a set of colored lines depicting the spatial and temporal impact of the amino acid on the corresponding tunnel. This representation clearly shows the importance of amino acids with respect to selected criteria. It helps the biochemists to select the candidate amino acids for mutation which changes the protein function in a desired way.

The goals are twofold: First, make the process of creating real, animated, data-driven visualizations of complex information more accessible to artists, graphic designers, and other visual experts with traditional, non-technical training. Second, support and enhance the role of human creativity in visualization design, enabling visual experimentation and workflows similar to what is possible with traditional artistic media. The approach is to conceive of visualization design as a combination of processes that are already closely linked with visual creativity: sketching, digital painting, image editing, and reacting to exemplars. Rather than studying and tweaking low-level algorithms and their parameters, designers create new visualizations by painting directly on top of a digital data canvas, sketching data glyphs, and arranging and blending together multiple layers of animated 2D graphics. This requires new algorithms and techniques to interpret painterly user input relative to data “under” the canvas, balance artistic freedom with the need to produce accurate data visualizations, and interactively explore large (e.g., terabyte-sized) multivariate datasets. Results demonstrate a variety of multivariate data visualization techniques can be rapidly recreated using the interface. More importantly, results and feedback from artists support the potential for interfaces in this style to attract new, creative users to the challenging task of designing more effective data visualizations and to help these users stay “in the creative zone” as they work.","article_number":"7185456","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7185456","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7185456/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7185456/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"877","end_page":"885","citing_paper_count":21,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2160,"insert_date":"20150811","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Image color analysis","Visualization","Painting","Paints","Brushes"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization design","multivariate","art","sketch","color map","glyph","Visualization design","multivariate","art","sketch","color map","glyph"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Visualization","Multivariate Data","Multivariate Statistics","Interactive","Direct Use","Direct Utilization","Direct Manipulation","Graphic Design","Visual Design","Multivariate Datasets","Image Editing","Creative Design","Local Features","Local Characteristics","Visual Task","Creative Process","Control Points","Vector Field","Color Map","Color Scheme","Wind Velocity","Jet Stream","Subtropical Jet","Global Operations","Brush Strokes","Art And Design","Visual Style","Map Design","Cartographic Design","Geopotential Height","Scientific Visualization","One-hour Intervals","Volume Rendering","Volumetric Rendering","Global Interpretation","Grid Layer"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467733","title":"PhenoBlocks: Phenotype Comparison Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":79,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Autodesk Research, University of Toronto","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085739236","id":37085739236,"full_name":"Michael Glueck","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Autodesk Research, University of Toronto"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Toronto","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37588933900","id":37588933900,"full_name":"Peter Hamilton","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Toronto"]}},{"affiliation":"INRIA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37395495900","id":37395495900,"full_name":"Fanny Chevalier","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["INRIA"]}},{"affiliation":"Autodesk Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085723416","id":37085723416,"full_name":"Simon Breslav","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Autodesk Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Autodesk Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085722798","id":37085722798,"full_name":"Azam Khan","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Autodesk Research"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Toronto","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37870405500","id":37870405500,"full_name":"Daniel Wigdor","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Toronto"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Toronto, Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085722488","id":37085722488,"full_name":"Michael Brudno","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Toronto, Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The differential diagnosis of hereditary disorders is a challenging task for clinicians due to the heterogeneity of phenotypes that can be observed in patients.

The simulation results support lighting designers in the creation of lighting configurations, which must meet contradicting customer objectives regarding quality and price while conforming to industry standards. However, current tools for lighting design impede rapid feedback cycles. On the one side, they decouple analysis and simulation specification. On the other side, they lack capabilities for a detailed comparison of multiple configurations. The primary contribution of this paper is a design study of LiteVis, a system for efficient decision support in lighting design. LiteVis tightly integrates global illumination-based lighting simulation, a spatial representation of the scene, and non-spatial visualizations of parameters and result indicators. This enables an efficient iterative cycle of simulation parametrization and analysis. Specifically, a novel visualization supports decision making by ranking simulated lighting configurations with regard to a weight-based prioritization of objectives that considers both spatial and non-spatial characteristics. In the spatial domain, novel concepts support a detailed comparison of illumination scenarios. We demonstrate LiteVis using a real-world use case and report qualitative feedback of lighting designers. This feedback indicates that LiteVis successfully supports lighting designers to achieve key tasks more efficiently and with greater certainty.","article_number":"7192703","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192703","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192703/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192703/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"290","end_page":"299","citing_paper_count":19,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":823,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Lighting","Computational modeling","Visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Decision making","Industries","Standards"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Integrating Spatial and Non-Spatial Data Visualization","Visualization in Physical Sciences and Engineering","Coordinated and Multiple Views","Visual Knowledge Discovery","Integrating Spatial and Non-Spatial Data Visualization","Visualization in Physical Sciences and Engineering","Coordinated and Multiple Views","Visual Knowledge Discovery"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Decision Support","Lighting Design","Decision-making","Spatial Domain","Industry Standards","Design Process","Input Parameters","Target Value","Parametrized","Global Index","Global Indices","Spatial Context","Multiple Solutions","Simulation Run","3D Scene","Number Of Surfaces","Horizontal Spacing","Horizontal Forms","Direct Output","Direct Yield","Bar Length","Spatial Objects","Comparison Of Solutions","Spatial Hierarchy","Spatial Focus","Spatial Foci","Ranking Table","Use Case Scenarios","Histogram Bars","Objective Weight","Parallel Coordinates","Ideal Solution","Monetary Cost","Domain Experts"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467198","title":"Accurate Interactive Visualization of Large Deformations and Variability in Biomedical Image Ensembles","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":81,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Institut für Informatik II, Universität Bonn","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38242231300","id":38242231300,"full_name":"Max Hermann","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institut für Informatik II, Universität Bonn"]}},{"affiliation":"Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, Plön","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38230626100","id":38230626100,"full_name":"Anja C.

Simple linear interpolation in the tangent space of the ensemble introduces artifactual anatomical structures that hamper the application of targeted visual shape analysis techniques. In this work we make use of the theory of stationary velocity fields to facilitate interactive non-linear image interpolation and plausible extrapolation for high quality rendering of large deformations and devise an efficient image warping method on the GPU. This does not only improve quality of existing visualization techniques, but opens up a field of novel interactive methods for shape ensemble analysis. Taking advantage of the efficient non-linear 3D image warping, we showcase four visualizations: 1) browsing on-the-fly computed group mean shapes to learn about shape differences between specific classes, 2) interactive reformation to investigate complex morphologies in a single view, 3) likelihood volumes to gain a concise overview of variability and 4) streamline visualization to show variation in detail, specifically uncovering its component tangential to a reference surface. Evaluation on a real world dataset shows that the presented method outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of visual quality while retaining interactive frame rates. A case study with a domain expert was performed in which the novel analysis and visualization methods are applied on standard model structures, namely skull and mandible of different rodents, to investigate and compare influence of phylogeny, diet and geography on shape. The visualizations enable for instance to distinguish (population-)normal and pathological morphology, assist in uncovering correlation to extrinsic factors and potentially support assessment of model quality.","article_number":"7192678","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192678","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192678/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192678/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"708","end_page":"717","citing_paper_count":18,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":873,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Shape","Visualization","Interpolation","Deformable models","Principal component analysis","Tin","Extrapolation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Statistical deformation model","stationary velocity fields","image warping,","interactive visual analysiimage warping,","Statistical deformation model","stationary velocity fields","image warping","interactive visual analysis"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Large Deformation","Interactive Visualization","Group Mean","Flow Velocity","Flow Speed","Velocity Field","Mandibular","Mandible","Dentary","Visual Analysis","Browsing","Visual Methods","Visual Quality","Visualization Techniques","Static Field","Influence Of Diet","Tangent Space","Single View","Mean Shape","Warped Image","Linear Method","Image Registration","Image Matching","Co-registration","Shape Variation","Interactive System","Principal Component Analysis Space","Modes Of Variability","Vector Field","Displacement Field","Diffeomorphism","Ray Casting","Ray Shooting","Volumetric Model","Phylogenetic Groups","Deformation Model","Nonlinear Deformation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2469125","title":"Spatial Reasoning and Data Displays","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":82,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Post Doc in the Department of Statistics, Iowa State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085688403","id":37085688403,"full_name":"Susan VanderPlas","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Post Doc in the Department of Statistics, Iowa State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Member of the faculty in the Human Computer Interaction program, Statistics at Iowa State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592793000","id":37592793000,"full_name":"Heike Hofmann","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Member of the faculty in the Human Computer Interaction program, Statistics at Iowa State University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Graphics convey numerical information very efficiently, but rely on a different set of mental processes than tabular displays.

Acquired codes leverage a user's experience to understand the meaning of a visualization. They range from figurative visualizations which rely on the reader's recognition of shapes, to conventional arrangements of graphic elements which represent particular subjects. In this study, we used content analysis to codify acquired meaning in visualization. We applied the content analysis to a set of infographics and data visualizations which are exemplars of innovative and effective design. 88% of the infographics and 71% of data visualizations in the sample contain at least one use of figurative visualization. Conventions on the arrangement of graphics are also widespread in the sample. In particular, a comparison of representations of time and other quantitative data showed that conventions can be specific to a subject. These results suggest that there is a need for information visualization research to expand its scope beyond perceptual channels, to include social and culturally constructed meaning. Our paper demonstrates a viable method for identifying figurative techniques and graphic conventions and integrating them into heuristics for visualization design.","article_number":"7192636","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192636","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192636/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192636/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"509","end_page":"518","citing_paper_count":17,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1776,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Shape","Encoding","Context","Image color analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual Design","Taxonomies","Illustrative Visualization","Design Methodologies","Visual Design","Taxonomies","Illustrative Visualization","Design Methodologies"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Visualization","Infographic","Graphical Display","Perceptual Primitives","Content Analysis","Visual Information","Vision Research","Representative Time","Visual Design","Graphical Elements","Audience","Horizontal Axis","Use Of Imaging","Image Manipulation","Community Of Practice","Guidelines For Use","Natural Objects","Visibility Graph","Visual Elements","Perceptual Cues","Conventional Means","Irreducible Representations","Irreps","Conventional Use","Composition Of Objects","Circular Layout","Visual Metaphors","Visual Literacy","Panel Composition","Krippendorff’s Alpha","Image Context","High-level Categories","Higher-level Categories","Implications For Research"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467031","title":"Visualizing Tensor Normal Distributions at Multiple Levels of Detail","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":84,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Bonn","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085649034","id":37085649034,"full_name":"Amin Abbasloo","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bonn"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Bonn","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085647247","id":37085647247,"full_name":"Vitalis Wiens","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bonn"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Bonn","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38242231300","id":38242231300,"full_name":"Max Hermann","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bonn"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Bonn","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606352800","id":37606352800,"full_name":"Thomas Schultz","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bonn"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Despite the widely recognized importance of symmetric second order tensor fields in medicine and engineering, the visualization of data uncertainty in tensor fields is still in its infancy. A recently proposed tensorial normal distribution, involving a fourth order covariance tensor, provides a mathematical description of how different aspects of the tensor field, such as trace, anisotropy, or orientation, vary and covary at each point. However, this wealth of information is far too rich for a human analyst to take in at a single glance, and no suitable visualization tools are available. We propose a novel approach that facilitates visual analysis of tensor covariance at multiple levels of detail. We start with a visual abstraction that uses slice views and direct volume rendering to indicate large-scale changes in the covariance structure, and locations with high overall variance. We then provide tools for interactive exploration, making it possible to drill down into different types of variability, such as in shape or orientation. Finally, we allow the analyst to focus on specific locations of the field, and provide tensor glyph animations and overlays that intuitively depict confidence intervals at those points. Our system is demonstrated by investigating the effects of measurement noise on diffusion tensor MRI, and by analyzing two ensembles of stress tensor fields from solid mechanics.","article_number":"7192624","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192624","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192624/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192624/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"975","end_page":"984","citing_paper_count":16,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":722,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Tensile stress","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Uncertainty","Data visualization","Image color analysis","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Covariance matrices"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty visualization","tensor visualization","direct volume rendering","interaction","glyph based visualization","Uncertainty visualization","tensor visualization","direct volume rendering","interaction","glyph based visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Normal Distribution","Gaussian Distribution","Multiple Levels Of Detail","Confidence Interval","Diffusion Tensor Imaging","Diffusion-weighted Imaging","Diffusion Tensor","Measurement Noise","Covariance Structure","Overall Variance","Overall Standard Deviation","Pooled Variance","Pooled Standard Deviation","Stress Tensor","Fourth Order","Interactive Exploration","Solid Mechanics","Hardening Mechanism","Curing Mechanism","Symmetric Tensor","Order Tensor","Volume Rendering","Volumetric Rendering","Square Root","White Matter","Gray Matter","High Complexity","Amount Of Change","Quantification Of Changes","Corpus Callosum","Callose","Fourth-order Tensor","Fractional Anisotropy","Edge Of Plate","Color Map","Three-dimensional Domain","Anisotropy Measurements","Eigenmodes","Eigenenergies","Eigenbasis","Spectral Decomposition","Principal Eigenvector","Distribution In Eq"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467911","title":"Vials: Visualizing Alternative Splicing of Genes","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":85,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Harvard University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38108845300","id":38108845300,"full_name":"Hendrik Strobelt","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University"]}},{"affiliation":"Vienna University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38242873200","id":38242873200,"full_name":"Bilal Alsallakh","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Vienna University of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085623315","id":37085623315,"full_name":"Joseph Botros","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of BioMedical Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085619032","id":37085619032,"full_name":"Brant Peterson","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of BioMedical Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of BioMedical Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085622189","id":37085622189,"full_name":"Mark Borowsky","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of BioMedical Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275698100","id":37275698100,"full_name":"Hanspeter Pfister","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard University, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37395933400","id":37395933400,"full_name":"Alexander Lex","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University, University of Utah"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Alternative splicing is a process by which the same DNA sequence is used to assemble different proteins, called protein isoforms. Alternative splicing works by selectively omitting some of the coding regions (exons) typically associated with a gene. Detection of alternative splicing is difficult and uses a combination of advanced data acquisition methods and statistical inference. Knowledge about the abundance of isoforms is important for understanding both normal processes and diseases and to eventually improve treatment through targeted therapies. The data, however, is complex and current visualizations for isoforms are neither perceptually efficient nor scalable. To remedy this, we developed Vials, a novel visual analysis tool that enables analysts to explore the various datasets that scientists use to make judgments about isoforms: the abundance of reads associated with the coding regions of the gene, evidence for junctions, i.e., edges connecting the coding regions, and predictions of isoform frequencies.

Set-typed attributes describe rich relations across elements, sets, and the set intersections. Increasing the number of sets results in a combinatorial growth of relations and creates scalability challenges. Exploratory tasks (e.g. selection, comparison) have commonly been designed in separation for set-typed attributes, which reduces interface consistency. To improve on scalability and to support rich, contextual exploration of set-typed data, we present AggreSet. AggreSet creates aggregations for each data dimension: sets, set-degrees, set-pair intersections, and other attributes. It visualizes the element count per aggregate using a matrix plot for set-pair intersections, and histograms for set lists, set-degrees and other attributes. Its non-overlapping visual design is scalable to numerous and large sets. AggreSet supports selection, filtering, and comparison as core exploratory tasks. It allows analysis of set relations inluding subsets, disjoint sets and set intersection strength, and also features perceptual set ordering for detecting patterns in set matrices. Its interaction is designed for rich and rapid data exploration. We demonstrate results on a wide range of datasets from different domains with varying characteristics, and report on expert reviews and a case study using student enrollment and degree data with assistant deans at a major public university.","article_number":"7194854","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194854","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7194854/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7194854/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"688","end_page":"697","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":878,"insert_date":"20150813","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Aggregates","Motion pictures","Data visualization","Visualization","Scalability","Filtering","Chapters"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Multi-valued attributes","sets","visualization","set visualization","data exploration","interaction","design","scalability","Multi-valued attributes","sets","visualization","set visualization","data exploration","interaction","design","scalability"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Dimensional Data","Exploratory Data","Rich Data","Date Of Registration","Enrollment Data","Expert Review","Set Membership","Students Enrolled","Disjoint Sets","Intersection Set","Numerous Settings","Visual Design","Exploration Task","Element Count","Rapid Exploration","Interactive","Documentary","Documentary Film","Distribution Of Elements","Bar Charts","Design Guidelines","Interaction Design","Circular Layout","Gray Background","Chord Diagram","Small Circle","Minimal Design"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467294","title":"Intuitive Exploration of Volumetric Data Using Dynamic Galleries","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":87,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Linköping University, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38228659100","id":38228659100,"full_name":"Daniel Jönsson","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Linköping University, Sweden"]}},{"affiliation":"Linköping University, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37565763500","id":37565763500,"full_name":"Martin Falk","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Linköping University, Sweden"]}},{"affiliation":"Linköping University, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284192000","id":37284192000,"full_name":"Anders Ynnerman","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Linköping University, Sweden"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this work we present a volume exploration method designed to be used by novice users and visitors to science centers and museums.

Interacting in the data domain is an effective way to filter away undesired information but it is difficult to predict where the values lie in the spatial domain. In this work we make extensive use of dynamic previews instantly generated as the user explores the data domain. The previews allow the user to predict what effect changes in the data domain will have on the rendered image without being aware that visual parameters are set in the data domain. Each preview represents a subrange of the data domain where overview and details are given on demand through zooming and panning. The method has been designed with touch interfaces as the target platform for interaction.

An optimization procedure which adjusts the angular positions of the skeleton nodes is then used to reconstruct the shape as closely as possible to the original, according to a specified view plane, which thus preserves the global geometric context of the object. Using this shape recovered embedded skeleton, the object surface is then flattened to the plane without occlusions using harmonic mapping. The boundary of the mesh is adjusted during the flattening step to account for regions where the mesh is stretched over concavities. This parameterized surface can then be used either as a map for guidance during endoluminal navigation or directly for interrogation and decision making. Depth cues are provided with a grayscale border to aid in shape understanding. Examples are presented using bronchial trees, cranial and lower limb blood vessels, and upper aorta datasets, and the results are evaluated quantitatively and with a user study.","article_number":"7192698","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192698","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192698/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192698/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"906","end_page":"915","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":729,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Skeleton","Shape","Three-dimensional displays","Layout","Visualization","Blood vessels","Context"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Geometry-based techniques","view-dependent visualization","medical visualization","planar embedding","Geometry-based techniques","view-dependent visualization","medical visualization","planar embedding"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Tree-like Structure","User Study","Concavity","Object Shape","Object Surface","Surface Parameters","Depth Perception","Depth Cues","Harmonic Functions","Harmonic Map","Planar Graphs","Planar Maps","Bronchial Tree","Distortion","Less Than Or Equal","Shape Structure","Color Map","Edge Length","Leaf Node","Original Shape","Value Of Radius","Values Of Radii","2D Projection","Triangular Mesh","Triangle Mesh","Original Mesh","Object Depth","Original 3D","Branch Nodes","Global Shape","Single View","Inner Nodes","Interior Nodes","Depth-first","Depth First Search","Mesh Vertices","Mesh Vertex","Shape Optimization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467992","title":"A Simple Approach for Boundary Improvement of Euler Diagrams","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":89,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Arizona","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37680680500","id":37680680500,"full_name":"Paolo Simonetto","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Arizona"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Arizona","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396011500","id":37396011500,"full_name":"Daniel Archambault","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Arizona"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Arizona","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550809300","id":37550809300,"full_name":"Carlos Scheidegger","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Arizona"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"General methods for drawing Euler diagrams tend to generate irregular polygons.

However, the choice of a specific data structure for a given data set depends on several factors, such as the memory budget, the sparsity of the data, and data access patterns. In general, there is no single optimal sparse data structure, but a set of several candidates with individual strengths and drawbacks. One solution to this problem are hybrid data structures which locally adapt themselves to the sparsity. However, they typically suffer from increased traversal overhead which limits their utility in many applications. This paper presents JiTTree, a novel sparse hybrid volume data structure that uses just-in-time compilation to overcome these problems. By combining multiple sparse data structures and reducing traversal overhead we leverage their individual advantages. We demonstrate that hybrid data structures adapt well to a large range of data sets. They are especially superior to other sparse data structures for data sets that locally vary in sparsity. Possible optimization criteria are memory, performance and a combination thereof. Through just-in-time (JIT) compilation, JiTTree reduces the traversal overhead of the resulting optimal data structure. As a result, our hybrid volume data structure enables efficient computations on the GPU, while being superior in terms of memory usage when compared to non-hybrid data structures.","article_number":"7192686","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192686","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192686/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192686/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"1025","end_page":"1034","citing_paper_count":13,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":826,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Octrees","Graphics processing units","Arrays","Memory management","Optimization","Layout"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data Transformation and Representation","GPUs and Multi-core Architectures","Volume Rendering","Data Transformation and Representation","GPUs and Multi-core Architectures","Volume Rendering"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Data Structure","Volume Of Data","Intensity Data","Sparse Data","Sparse Structure","Sparse Data Structures","Sparsity","Structural Optimization","Local Adaptation","Computational Memory","Compute-in-memory","In-memory Computing","Access Patterns","Use In Many Applications","Utility In Many Applications","Dense Regions","Root Node","Parent Node","Volume Density","Intensity Density","Leaf Node","Levels In Roots","Sparse Representation","Performance In Cases","Computational Demands","Memory Consumption","Dense Representation","Empty Regions","Binary Search","Binary Tree","Tree Search","Compact Array","Sparse Datasets","Memory Efficiency","Ray Casting","Ray Shooting","Acceleration Factor","Speedup Factor"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467323","title":"Automatic Selection of Partitioning Variables for Small Multiple Displays","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":91,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Tableau Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37548165700","id":37548165700,"full_name":"Anushka Anand","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tableau Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Tableau Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604514900","id":37604514900,"full_name":"Justin Talbot","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Tableau Research"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Effective small multiple displays are created by partitioning a visualization on variables that reveal interesting conditional structure in the data.

Besides these shadow-like effects, interreflections are also known to improve the spatial comprehension of complex geometric structures. Unfortunately, the inherent computational complexity of interreflections would forbid interactive exploration, which is mandatory in many scenarios dealing with static and time-varying data. In this paper, we introduce a novel analytic approach for capturing interreflections of molecular structures in real-time. By exploiting the knowledge of the underlying space filling representations, we are able to reduce the required parameters and can thus apply symbolic regression to obtain an analytic expression for interreflections. We show how to obtain the data required for the symbolic regression analysis, and how to exploit our analytic solution to enhance interactive molecular visualizations.","article_number":"7192702","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192702","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192702/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192702/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"718","end_page":"727","citing_paper_count":12,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":717,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Atomic measurements","Visualization","Lighting","Rendering (computer graphics)","Data visualization","Complexity theory","Real-time systems"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Molecular visualization","diffuse interreflections","ambient occlusion","Molecular visualization","diffuse interreflections","ambient occlusion"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Molecular Visualization","Ambient Occlusion","Molecular Structure","Molecular Simulations","Visualization Techniques","Interactive Visualization","Symbolic Analysis","Cell Size","Scope Of This Paper","Interaction Strength","Frame Rate","Grid Cells","Parametrized","First Pass","Solvent Accessible Surface Area","Solvent Accessible Surface","Solvent Accessibility","Attractive Forces","Atomic Scale","Molecular Surface","Global Parameters","Receptor Molecules","Multiparametric Data","Visual Communication","Reflectance Properties","Vision Algorithms","Solid Angle","Atom Count","World Space","Visual Quality","Domain Experts","Analytical Representation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2468031","title":"Mining Graphs for Understanding Time-Varying Volumetric Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":93,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38021343000","id":38021343000,"full_name":"Yi Gu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN"]}},{"affiliation":"Department Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37405886900","id":37405886900,"full_name":"Chaoli Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN"]}},{"affiliation":"Division of Mathematics and Computer Science, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295026400","id":37295026400,"full_name":"Tom Peterka","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Division of Mathematics and Computer Science, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL"]}},{"affiliation":"Division of Mathematics and Computer Science, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37288742700","id":37288742700,"full_name":"Robert Jacob","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Division of Mathematics and Computer Science, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085755417","id":37085755417,"full_name":"Seung Hyun Kim","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"A notable recent trend in time-varying volumetric data analysis and visualization is to extract data relationships and represent them in a low-dimensional abstract graph view for visual understanding and making connections to the underlying data. Nevertheless, the ever-growing size and complexity of data demands novel techniques that go beyond standard brushing and linking to allow significant reduction of cognition overhead and interaction cost. In this paper, we present a mining approach that automatically extracts meaningful features from a graph-based representation for exploring time-varying volumetric data. This is achieved through the utilization of a series of graph analysis techniques including graph simplification, community detection, and visual recommendation. We investigate the most important transition relationships for time-varying data and evaluate our solution with several time-varying data sets of different sizes and characteristics. For gaining insights from the data, we show that our solution is more efficient and effective than simply asking users to extract relationships via standard interaction techniques, especially when the data set is large and the relationships are complex. We also collect expert feedback to confirm the usefulness of our approach.","article_number":"7194853","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194853","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7194853/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7194853/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"965","end_page":"974","citing_paper_count":12,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1242,"insert_date":"20150813","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Connectors","Fans","Data mining","Feature extraction","Layout"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Time-varying data visualization","graph simplification","community detection","visual recommendation","Time-varying data visualization","graph simplification","community detection","visual recommendation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Time-varying Data","Data Visualization","Community Detection","Simple Graph","Transitive Relation","Time Step","Visual Representation","Transition Probabilities","Early Steps","Directed Graph","Directed Edge","Nodes In The Graph","Graph Structure","Leaf Node","Group Of Nodes","Large-scale Structures","Graph Features","Characteristic Graph","Dijkstra’s Algorithm","End Nodes","Similar Nodes","Scientific Visualization","Label Propagation Algorithm","Parallel Coordinates","Average Node Degree","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Undirected","Undirected Graph","Lower Branch","Rest Of The Region","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Time Interval"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467963","title":"Anisotropic Ambient Volume Shading","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":94,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37393968500","id":37393968500,"full_name":"Marco Ament","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37395703400","id":37395703400,"full_name":"Carsten Dachsbacher","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present a novel method to compute anisotropic shading for direct volume rendering to improve the perception of the orientation and shape of surface-like structures. We determine the scale-aware anisotropy of a shading point by analyzing its ambient region. We sample adjacent points with similar scalar values to perform a principal component analysis by computing the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. In particular, we estimate the tangent directions, which serve as the tangent frame for anisotropic bidirectional reflectance distribution functions. Moreover, we exploit the ratio of the eigenvalues to measure the magnitude of the anisotropy at each shading point. Altogether, this allows us to model a data-driven, smooth transition from isotropic to strongly anisotropic volume shading. In this way, the shape of volumetric features can be enhanced significantly by aligning specular highlights along the principal direction of anisotropy. Our algorithm is independent of the transfer function, which allows us to compute all shading parameters once and store them with the data set. We integrated our method in a GPU-based volume renderer, which offers interactive control of the transfer function, light source positions, and viewpoint. Our results demonstrate the benefit of anisotropic shading for visualization to achieve data-driven local illumination for improved perception compared to isotropic shading.","article_number":"7194844","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194844","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7194844/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7194844/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"1015","end_page":"1024","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":831,"insert_date":"20150813","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Lighting","Covariance matrices","Shape","Estimation","Scattering","Rendering (computer graphics)"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Direct volume rendering","volume illumination","anisotropic shading","Direct volume rendering","volume illumination","anisotropic shading"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Volumetric","Light Source","Covariance Matrix","Covariance Matrices","Eigenvectors","Transfer Function","Scalar Value","Principal Directions","Volume Rendering","Volumetric Rendering","Directional Anisotropy","Structural Information","Scaling Factor","Ellipsoid","Normal Vector","Spatial Domain","Data Space","Eigenmodes","Eigenenergies","Eigenbasis","Normal Approximation","Normal Estimation","Global Parameters","Isosurface","Tangent Vector","Principal Curvatures","Curved Lines","Local Frame","Degree Of Anisotropy","Tangent Plane","Shape Perception","Interval Size","Tangent Space","Spherical Harmonics","Memory Consumption"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2466838","title":"Extracting, Tracking, and Visualizing Magnetic Flux Vortices in 3D Complex-Valued Superconductor Simulation Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":95,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085681553","id":37085681553,"full_name":"Hanqi Guo","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085534119","id":37085534119,"full_name":"Carolyn L.

We present SchemeLens, a vector-based, topology-aware fisheye technique which aims to maintain the readability of the diagram. Vector-based scaling reduces distortion to components, but distorts layout. We present several strategies to reduce this distortion by using the structure of the topology, including orthogonality and alignment, and a model of user intention to foster smooth and predictable navigation. We evaluate this approach through two user studies: Results show that (1) SchemeLens is 16-27% faster than both round and rectangular flat-top fisheye lenses at finding and identifying a target along one or several paths in a network diagram; (2) augmenting SchemeLens with a model of user intentions aids in learning the network topology.","article_number":"7192681","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192681","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192681/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192681/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"330","end_page":"338","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":632,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Lenses","Distortion","Navigation","Visualization","Context","Layout","Shape"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Fisheye","vector-scaling","content-aware","network schematics","interactive zoom","navigation","information visualization","Fisheye","vector-scaling","content-aware","network schematics","interactive zoom","navigation","information visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Navigation","Distortion","Readability","Network Topology","User Study","Visual Network","Network Diagram","Usage Intention","Hydraulic System","Fisheye Lens","Wide-angle Lens","Fisheye Camera","Fisheye Lenses","Schematic Of The System","Scaling Factor","Completion Time","Task Difficulty","Node Size","Temporal Stability","Design Goals","Magnifying Glass","Hand Lens","Magnification Lens","Unified Modeling Language","Structure Diagram","Target Node","Principal Plane","Center Of The Lens","Optical Center","Spatial Stability","Geodesic Distance","Shape Components","Part Of Diagram","Position Components","Redundant Components","Subjective Preferences","Nearest Node","Overview Of Structure"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467292","title":"Multi-field Pattern Matching based on Sparse Feature Sampling","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":97,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"MPI for Informatics, Saarbrücken, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37074282700","id":37074282700,"full_name":"Zhongjie Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["MPI for Informatics, Saarbrücken, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"MPI for Informatics, Saarbrücken, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271851300","id":37271851300,"full_name":"Hans-Peter Seidel","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["MPI for Informatics, Saarbrücken, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282635100","id":37282635100,"full_name":"Tino Weinkauf","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present an approach to pattern matching in 3D multi-field scalar data.

First, we extract a sparse set of features for each 3D scalar field using the 3D SIFT algorithm (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform). This allows for a memory-saving description of prominent features in the data with invariance to translation, rotation, and scaling. Second, the user defines a pattern as a set of SIFT features in multiple fields by e.g. brushing a region of interest. Third, we locate and rank matching patterns in the entire data set.

Contracting isocontours to single points encapsulates variations in isocontour connectivity in the Reeb graph. For multivariate data, isocontours generalize to fibers-inverse images of points in the range, and this area is therefore known as fiber topology. However, fiber topology is less fully developed than Morse theory, and current efforts rely on manual visualizations. This paper presents how to accelerate and semi-automate this task through an interface for visualizing fiber singularities of multivariate functions R3→R2. This interface exploits existing conventions of fiber topology, but also introduces a 3D view based on the extension of Reeb graphs to Reeb spaces. Using the Joint Contour Net, a quantized approximation of the Reeb space, this accelerates topological visualization and permits online perturbation to reduce or remove degeneracies in functions under study. Validation of the interface is performed by assessing whether the interface supports the mathematical workflow both of experts and of less experienced mathematicians.","article_number":"7192700","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192700","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192700/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192700/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"945","end_page":"954","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":458,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Topology","Isosurfaces","Shape","Visualization","Manuals","Polynomials"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Singular fibers","fiber topology","mathematical visualization","design study","Singular fibers","fiber topology","mathematical visualization","design study"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Singular Fibers","Singular Fibres","Preimage","Inverse Image","Multivariate Function","Value Function","Singular Value","Space Of Functions","Radial Basis Function","Color Code","Topological Features","Topological Characteristics","Domain Boundaries","Topological Changes","Isosurface","Space Domain","Fiber Components","Fibrous Components","Complex Topology","Functional Perturbation","Singular Point","Connected Components","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Scalar Case","Singular Theory","Homology Functor","Singular Homology","Singular Complex","L2 Cache","Mathematical Preliminaries","3D Space","3-dimensional Space"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467291","title":"Reconstruction and Visualization of Coordinated 3D Cell Migration Based on Optical Flow","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":102,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"IWR, Heidelberg University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085701367","id":37085701367,"full_name":"Christopher P.

One of the central questions in developmental biology is to understand precisely how cells reorganize, as well as how and to what extent this reorganization is coordinated. While modern microscopes can record video data for every cell during animal development in 3D+t, analyzing these videos remains a major challenge: reconstruction of comprehensive cell tracks turned out to be very demanding especially with decreasing data quality and increasing cell densities. In this paper, we present an analysis pipeline for coordinated cellular motions in developing embryos based on the optical flow of a series of 3D images. We use numerical integration to reconstruct cellular long-term motions in the optical flow of the video, we take care of data validation, and we derive a LIC-based, dense flow visualization for the resulting pathlines. This approach allows us to handle low video quality such as noisy data or poorly separated cells, and it allows the biologists to get a comprehensive understanding of their data by capturing dynamic growth processes in stills. We validate our methods using three videos of growing fruit fly embryos.","article_number":"7210213","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7210213","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7210213/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7210213/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"995","end_page":"1004","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":871,"insert_date":"20150819","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image reconstruction","Data visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Optical imaging","Embryo","Adaptive optics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Cell migration","vector field","3D","time-dependent","LIC","tracking","validation","Cell migration","vector field","3D","time-dependent","LIC","tracking","validation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Optical Flow","3D Images","Biologists","Video Data","Video Quality","Flow Visualization","Pathlines","Time Step","Cell Nuclei","Cell Nucleus","Point Cloud","Flow Field","Vector Field","Steady Flow","Unsteady Flow","3D Visualization","Posterior Pole","Particle Image Velocimetry","Inverse Distance Weighting","Polytope","3D Video","3D Movies","3D Film","Step Of The Pipeline","3D Flow","Primitive Streak","Germband","Volume Rendering","Volumetric Rendering","Strong Motion","Position Of Nucleus","Position Of Nuclei","Acceptable Cost","Consecutive Time Steps","Ventral","Dorsally","Supine Position","Cell Motility","Cell Movement","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467412","title":"Adaptive Multilinear Tensor Product Wavelets","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":103,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089135813","id":37089135813,"full_name":"Kenneth Weiss","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37269320000","id":37269320000,"full_name":"Peter Lindstrom","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Many foundational visualization techniques including isosurfacing, direct volume rendering and texture mapping rely on piecewise multilinear interpolation over the cells of a mesh. However, there has not been much focus within the visualization community on techniques that efficiently generate and encode globally continuous functions defined by the union of multilinear cells. Wavelets provide a rich context for analyzing and processing complicated datasets. In this paper, we exploit adaptive regular refinement as a means of representing and evaluating functions described by a subset of their nonzero wavelet coefficients. We analyze the dependencies involved in the wavelet transform and describe how to generate and represent the coarsest adaptive mesh with nodal function values such that the inverse wavelet transform is exactly reproduced via simple interpolation (subdivision) over the mesh elements. This allows for an adaptive, sparse representation of the function with on-demand evaluation at any point in the domain. We focus on the popular wavelets formed by tensor products of linear B-splines, resulting in an adaptive, nonconforming but crack-free quadtree (2D) or octree (3D) mesh that allows reproducing globally continuous functions via multilinear interpolation over its cells.","article_number":"7192734","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192734","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192734/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7192734/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"985","end_page":"994","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":560,"insert_date":"20150812","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Wavelet transforms","Octrees","Interpolation","Tensile stress","Splines (mathematics)","Wavelet domain"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Multilinear interpolation","adaptive wavelets","multiresolution models","octrees","continuous reconstruction","Multilinear interpolation","adaptive wavelets","multiresolution models","octrees","continuous reconstruction"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Tensor Product","Multilinear","Interpolation","Value Function","Wavelet Transform","Wavelet Coefficients","Points In Domain","Adaptive Mesh","Adaptive Refinement","Quadtree","Grid Points","Linear Interpolation","Regular Grid","Cartesian Grid","Grid Structure","Rectangular Grid","Functional Scale","Level Of Resolution","Entire Domain","Distance Map","Distance Transform","Distance Field","Isosurface","Binary Tree","Uniform Grid","Range Of Datasets","Mesh Vertices","Mesh Vertex","Running Example","Natural Step","Uniform Case","Adaptive Grid","Total Processing Time","Corner Cube","Domain Decomposition","Wavelet Domain","Wavelet Basis"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467962","title":"Effectiveness of Structured Textures on Dynamically Changing Terrain-like Surfaces","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":104,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"The Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping, The University of New Hampshire","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591215700","id":37591215700,"full_name":"Thomas Butkiewicz","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping, The University of New Hampshire"]}},{"affiliation":"The Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping, The University of New Hampshire","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085713831","id":37085713831,"full_name":"Andrew H.

However, most of these studies examined the application of these techniques to static surfaces. This paper explores the effectiveness of applying these techniques to dynamically changing surfaces. When these surfaces change shape, common texturing methods, such as grids and contours, induce a range of different motion cues, which can draw attention and provide information about the size, shape, and rate of change. A human factors study was conducted to evaluate the relative effectiveness of these methods when applied to dynamically changing pseudo-terrain surfaces. The results indicate that, while no technique is most effective for all cases, contour lines generally perform best, and that the pseudo-contour lines induced by banded color scales convey the same benefits.","article_number":"7194846","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194846","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7194846/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7194846/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"31 Jan. 2016","start_page":"926","end_page":"934","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":391,"insert_date":"20150813","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Shape","Animation","Surface texture","Three-dimensional displays","Sea surface","Color","Visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Structured textures","terrain","deformation","dynamic surfaces","Structured textures","terrain","deformation","dynamic surfaces"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Isothermal","Contour Plots","Motion Cues","Static Surface","Large Changes","Subtle Changes","Dynamic Environment","Detection Task","Regular Grid","Cartesian Grid","Grid Structure","Rectangular Grid","Viewing Angle","Increase In The Odds","Surface Curvature","Open Curves","Surface Deformation","Dynamic Surface","Surface Kinetics","Terrain Model","Plan View","Structure From Motion","Comparison Task","Dynamic Scenes","Grid Lines","Grid Cell Size","Visual Noise","Smooth Texture","Height Conditions","Height Status","Visual Cues","Grid Cells","Static Scenes","Surface Shape","Interactive","Likelihood Ratio Test","Log-likelihood Ratio","Interaction Term"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2469071","title":"VIS Conference Committee","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":105,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Presents a listing of this VIS 2015 conference committee.","article_number":"7307925","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307925","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7307925/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7307925/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":7307919,"publication_year":2016,"publication_date":"Jan. 2016","start_page":"xvii","end_page":"xvii","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":112,"insert_date":"20151027","index_terms":{}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2468793","title":"Message from the VIS Paper Chairs and Guest Editors","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"1","issn":"2160-9306","rank":106,"volume":"22","authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The papers in this special issue were presented at IEEE VIS 2015, held during October 25-30, 2015 in Chicago, IL.
