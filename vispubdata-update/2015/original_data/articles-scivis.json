Nevertheless, an easy-to-use system also has to be adapted to the capabilities of modern hardware architectures, as only this allows for realizing interactive visualizations. With this trade-off in mind, we have designed and realized the cross-platform Inviwo (Interactive Visualization Workshop) visualization framework, that supports both interactive visualization research as well as efficient visualization application development and deployment. In this poster we give an overview of the architecture behind Inviwo, and show how its design enables us and other researchers to realize their visualization ideas efficiently. Inviwo consists of a modern and lightweight, graphics independent core, which is extended by optional modules that encapsulate visualization algorithms, well-known utility libraries and commonly used parallel-processing APIs (such as OpenGL and OpenCL). The core enables a simplistic structure for creating bridges between the different modules regarding data transfer across architecture and devices with an easy-to-use screen graph and minimalistic programming. Making the base structures in a modern way while providing intuitive methods of extending the functionality and creating modules based on other modules, we hope that Inviwo can help the visualization community to perform research through a rapid-prototyping design and GUI, while at the same time allowing users to take advantage of the results implemented in the system in any way they desire later on. Inviwo is publicly available at www.inviwo.org, and can be used freely by anyone under a permissive free software license (Simplified BSD).","article_number":"7429514","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7429514","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429514/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429514/","publication_title":"2015 IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference (SciVis)","conference_location":"Chicago, IL, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2015","publication_number":7411953,"is_number":7429473,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2015","start_page":"163","end_page":"164","citing_paper_count":12,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":375,"insert_date":"20160310","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Computer architecture","Pipelines","Program processors","Licenses","Three-dimensional displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Inviwo","Interactive Visualization Workshop","Rapid Prototyping","Open Source Software"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Framework","Interactive Visualization","Vision Algorithms","Hardware Architecture","Optional Modules","Visual System","Flow Data","Depth Of Field","Expert Users","Visual Molecular Dynamics","Molecular Visualization","Advanced Visualization"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9785-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/SciVis.2015.7429497","title":"Cavern Halos: Exploring spatial and nonspatial cosmological data in an immersive virtual environment","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-9785-8","rank":2,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Adler Planetarium, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085778645","id":37085778645,"full_name":"Peter Hanula","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Adler Planetarium, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL"]}},{"affiliation":"Adler Planetarium, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085775128","id":37085775128,"full_name":"Kamil Piekutowski","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Adler Planetarium, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL"]}},{"affiliation":"Adler Planetarium, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38181235500","id":38181235500,"full_name":"Carlos Uribe","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Adler Planetarium, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL"]}},{"affiliation":"Adler Planetarium, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085728341","id":37085728341,"full_name":"Kyle Almryde","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Adler Planetarium, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL"]}},{"affiliation":"Adler Planetarium, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085621999","id":37085621999,"full_name":"Arthur Nishimoto","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Adler Planetarium, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL"]}},{"affiliation":"Adler Planetarium, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38119648300","id":38119648300,"full_name":"Julieta Aguilera","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Adler Planetarium, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL"]}},{"affiliation":"Electronic Visualization Laboratory University of Illinois at Chicago","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37937697100","id":37937697100,"full_name":"G.

Central to our application is the ability to navigate the halos by interactively \"jumping\" from tree to tree. By clearly marking halos that have \"tributaries\" — that is, that split off into multiple halos or merge with one or more halos — we make it easy for the user to traverse the complex structure of the universe.

Students and faculty from the fields of architectural history and archaeology at two institutions interacted with the models and answered a short survey with four questions about each.

Specifically, probabilistic tractography quantifies the existence of physical connections to a given seed region as a 3D scalar map of confidence scores. Fiber-Stippling is a visualization for probabilistic tracts that effectively communicates the diffusion pattern, connectivity score, and anatomical context. Unfortunately, it cannot handle multiple diffusion orientations per voxel, which exist in high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) data. Such data is needed to resolve tracts in complex configurations, such as crossings. In this work, we suggest a visualization based on Fiber-Stippling but sensible to multiple diffusion orientations from HARDI-based diffusion models. With such a technique, it is now possible to visualize probabilistic tracts from HARDI-based tractography algorithms. This implies that tract crossings may now be visualized as crossing stipples, which is an essential step towards an accurate visualization of the neuroanatomy, as crossing tracts are widespread phenomena in the brain.","article_number":"7429506","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7429506","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429506/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429506/","publication_title":"2015 IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference (SciVis)","conference_location":"Chicago, IL, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2015","publication_number":7411953,"is_number":7429473,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2015","start_page":"147","end_page":"148","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":84,"insert_date":"20160310","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Probabilistic logic","Data visualization","Context","Electronic mail","Phantoms","Optical fiber networks","Magnetic resonance imaging"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["I.3.3 [Computer Graphics]","Picture/Image Generation — Line and curve generation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Probabilistic Tract","White Matter","Diffusion Model","Diffuse Pattern","Dispersal Patterns","Confidence Score","White Matter Tracts","White Matter Pathways","Angular Resolution","Complex Configurations","Probabilistic Tractography","Connectivity Scores","Tractography Algorithms","Neural Pathways","Neuronal Pathways","Tracing Studies","Line Integral","Visual Metaphors"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9785-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/SciVis.2015.7429510","title":"A bottom-up scheme for user-defined feature exploration in vector field ensembles","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-9785-8","rank":13,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), Peking University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085456802","id":37085456802,"full_name":"Richen Liu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), Peking University"]}},{"affiliation":"Argonne National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085681553","id":37085681553,"full_name":"Hanqi Guo","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Argonne National Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"Beijing Engineering Technology Research Center of Virtual Simulation and Visualization, Peking University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403856700","id":37403856700,"full_name":"Xiaoru Yuan","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Beijing Engineering Technology Research Center of Virtual Simulation and Visualization, Peking University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Most of the existing approaches to visualize vector field ensembles are achieved by visualizing the uncertainty of individual variables from different simulation runs.

Although it is a view-dependent method, PathlinesExplorer combines both exploration and modification of visual aspects without re-accessing the original huge data. Our approach is based on constructing a per-pixel linked list data structure in which each pixel contains a list of pathline segments. With this view-dependent method, it is possible to filter, color-code, and explore large-scale flow data in real-time. In addition, optimization techniques such as early-ray termination and deferred shading are applied, which further improves the performance and scalability of our approach.","article_number":"7429512","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7429512","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429512/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429512/","publication_title":"2015 IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference (SciVis)","conference_location":"Chicago, IL, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2015","publication_number":7411953,"is_number":7429473,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2015","start_page":"159","end_page":"160","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":104,"insert_date":"20160310","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Real-time systems","Three-dimensional displays","Buffer storage","Computers","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Image-based rendering","per-pixel linked list","pathline fields","explorable images","deferred shading","early-ray termination"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Pathlines","Computation Time","Calculation Time","Memory Size"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9785-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/SciVis.2015.7429505","title":"Real-time interactive time correction on the GPU","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-9785-8","rank":15,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085641969","id":37085641969,"full_name":"Mai Elshehaly","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virginia Tech."]}},{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37323697500","id":37323697500,"full_name":"Denis Gračanin","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virginia Tech."]}},{"affiliation":"Ain Shams University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085684904","id":37085684904,"full_name":"Mohamed Gad","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Ain Shams University"]}},{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085897852","id":37085897852,"full_name":"Junpeng Wang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virginia Tech."]}},{"affiliation":"Alexandria University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38187835300","id":38187835300,"full_name":"Hicham G.

Our approach is able to render up to billions of particles on a typical workstation, purely on the CPU, without any approximations or level-of-detail techniques, and optionally with attribute-based color mapping, dynamic range query, and advanced lighting models such as ambient occlusion and path tracing.","article_number":"7429492","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7429492","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429492/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429492/","publication_title":"2015 IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference (SciVis)","conference_location":"Chicago, IL, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2015","publication_number":7411953,"is_number":7429473,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2015","start_page":"57","end_page":"64","citing_paper_count":20,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":416,"insert_date":"20160310","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Ray tracing","Rendering (computer graphics)","Data visualization","Graphics processing units","Data models","Acceleration","Memory management"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Ray tracing","Visualization","Particle Data","k-d Trees"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Large Particles","Ray Tracing","Large Datasets","Data Structure","Molecular Dynamics","Workstation","Color Map","Range Query","Scalable","Large Data","Transfer Function","Bounding Box","Root Node","Parent Node","Cosmological","Leaf Node","Interactive Visualization","Maximum Extent","Spatial Partitioning","Partition Of Space","Inner Nodes","Interior Nodes","Ray Casting","Ray Shooting","Geometric Primitives","Graphical Primitives","Round Robin","Frustum","Instruction Set Architecture","Active Electron","Regeneration Buffer","Framebuffer","Display Memory","Maximum Radius","Memory Consumption","Left Side"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9785-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/SciVis.2015.7429485","title":"A classification of user tasks in visual analysis of volume data","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-9785-8","rank":23,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Stanford University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37400143500","id":37400143500,"full_name":"Bireswar Laha","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Stanford University"]}},{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282977600","id":37282977600,"full_name":"Doug A.

Many large meteorological centers are producing highly accurate ensemble forecasts routinely to provide effective weather forecast services. However, biases frequently exist in forecast products because of various reasons, such as the imperfection of the weather forecast models. Failure to identify and neutralize the biases would result in unreliable forecast products that might mislead analysts; consequently, unreliable weather predictions are produced. The analog method has been commonly used to overcome the biases. Nevertheless, this method has some serious limitations including the difficulties in finding effective similar past forecasts, the large search space for proper parameters and the lack of support for interactive, real-time analysis. In this study, we develop a visual analytics system based on a novel voting framework to circumvent the problems. The framework adopts the idea of majority voting to combine judiciously the different variants of analog methods towards effective retrieval of the proper analogs for calibration. The system seamlessly integrates the analog methods into an interactive visualization pipeline with a set of coordinated views that characterizes the different methods. Instant visual hints are provided in the views to guide users in finding and refining analogs. We have worked closely with the domain experts in the meteorological research to develop the system. The effectiveness of the system is demonstrated using two case studies. An informal evaluation with the experts proves the usability and usefulness of the system.","article_number":"7429488","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7429488","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429488/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429488/","publication_title":"2015 IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference (SciVis)","conference_location":"Chicago, IL, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2015","publication_number":7411953,"is_number":7429473,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2015","start_page":"25","end_page":"32","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":343,"insert_date":"20160310","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Weather forecasting","Calibration","Visualization","Uncertainty","Probabilistic logic"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Weather forecast","analog method","calibration","majority voting","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Framework","Voting Framework","Forecast Calibration","Forecasting","Majority Voting","Domain Experts","Interactive Visualization","Parallel Method","Analogous Method","Numerical Weather Prediction","Weather Models","Ensemble Forecasts","Root Mean Square Error","Root-mean-square Deviation","RMSD","RMSE","Final Results","Small Region","Improvement In Accuracy","Red Arrows","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Meteorological Data","Close Collaboration","Bar Charts","Probabilistic Forecasts","Routine Work","Overview Of Data","Line Chart","Current Forecasts","Color Bar","Purple Line","Smallest Difference","Smallest Deviation","Red Border","Workflow Systems"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9785-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/SciVis.2015.7429491","title":"Feature-based tensor field visualization for fiber reinforced polymers","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-9785-8","rank":25,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Leipzig University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085688811","id":37085688811,"full_name":"Valentin Zobel","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Leipzig University"]}},{"affiliation":"Leipzig University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085692798","id":37085692798,"full_name":"Markus Stommel","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Leipzig University"]}},{"affiliation":"Leipzig University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282574800","id":37282574800,"full_name":"Gerik Scheuermann","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Leipzig University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Virtual testing is an integral part of modern product development in mechanical engineering. Numerical structure simulations allow the computation of local stresses which are given as tensor fields.

A material-dependent threshold defines the material failure answering the key question of engineers. This leads to a rather simple feature-based visualisation. For composite materials like short fiber reinforced polymers, the situation is much more complex. The material property is determined by the fiber distribution at every position, often described as fiber orientation tensor field. Essentially, the material's ability to cope with stress becomes anisotropic and inhomogeneous. We show how to combine the stress field and the fiber orientation field in such cases, leading to a feature-based visualization of tensor fields for composite materials. The resulting features inform the engineer about potential improvements in the product development.","article_number":"7429491","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7429491","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429491/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429491/","publication_title":"2015 IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference (SciVis)","conference_location":"Chicago, IL, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2015","publication_number":7411953,"is_number":7429473,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2015","start_page":"49","end_page":"56","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":245,"insert_date":"20160310","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Tensile stress","Visualization","Plastics","Injection molding","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["tensor visualization","feature-based visualisation","composite materials","structural mechanics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Fiber-reinforced Polymer","Material Properties","Anisotropy","Simulated Structure","Fiber Orientation","Stress Field","Local Stress","Mechanical Engineering","Short Fibers","Short Fibres","Von Mises Stress","Von Mises","Material Failure","Stress Calculation","Virtual Test","Shear Stress","Finite Element Method","Current Design","Current Name","Tensile Stress","Compressive Strength","Normal Stress","Orange Region","Unidirectional Fiber","Fiber Direction","Yield Criterion","Yield Criteria","Yellow Region","Stress Tensor","Order Tensor","Geometric Design","Symmetric Tensor","Dirac Delta","Dirac Function","Dirac Distribution","Dirac Delta Function"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9785-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/SciVis.2015.7429493","title":"Auto-calibration of multi-projector displays with a single handheld camera","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-9785-8","rank":26,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon, Republic of Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085619811","id":37085619811,"full_name":"Sanghun Park","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon, Republic of Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon, Republic of Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085628777","id":37085628777,"full_name":"Hyunggoog Seo","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon, Republic of Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon, Republic of Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085630211","id":37085630211,"full_name":"Seunghoon Cha","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon, Republic of Korea"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon, Republic of Korea","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37720728400","id":37720728400,"full_name":"Junyong Noh","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon, Republic of Korea"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"We present a novel approach that utilizes a simple handheld camera to automatically calibrate multi-projector displays. Most existing studies adopt active structured light patterns to verify the relationship between the camera and the projectors.

Moreover, the observation of the entire area by the camera is almost impossible for a small space surrounded by walls as there is not enough distance for the camera to capture the entire scene. We tackle these issues by requiring only a portion of the walls to be visible to a handheld camera that is widely used these days. This becomes possible by the introduction of our new structured light pattern scheme based on a perfect submap and a geometric calibration that successfully utilizes the geometric information of multi-planar environments. We demonstrate that immersive display in a small space such as an ordinary room can be effectively created using images captured by a handheld camera.","article_number":"7429493","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7429493","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429493/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429493/","publication_title":"2015 IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference (SciVis)","conference_location":"Chicago, IL, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2015","publication_number":7411953,"is_number":7429473,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2015","start_page":"65","end_page":"72","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":455,"insert_date":"20160310","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Cameras","Calibration","Three-dimensional displays","Multiplexing","Image color analysis","Electronic mail","Feature extraction"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["I.3.3 [Computer Graphics]: Picture/Image Generation — Display algorithms","I.4.1 [Image Processing and Computer Vision]: Digitization and Image Capture — Imaging geometry","I.4.1 [Image Processing and Computer Vision]: Digitization and Image Capture — Camera calibration","I.3.3 [Hardware]","Input/Output Devices — Image display"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Projector","Small Space","Structured Illumination","Structured Light","Geometric Information","Light Patterns","Automatic Calibration","Geometric Calibration","Spatial Patterns","Spatiotemporal Patterns","Temporal Patterns","Binary Image","Corresponding Points","Corresponding Features","Camera View","Codeword","Checkers","Checkerboard Pattern","Use Of Cameras","Mathematical Properties","Camera Resolution","Homography","Projectivity","Resolution Of Patterns","Coding Patterns","Display Area","Plane Wall","Alpha Matte","Alpha Maps","Alpha Blending","Alpha Channel","High-resolution Patterns","Gray Code","Grey Number","Geometric Primitives","Graphical Primitives","Alphabet Size","Apple iPhone","Color Channels"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9785-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/SciVis.2015.7429486","title":"Using maximum topology matching to explore differences in species distribution models","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-9785-8","rank":27,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38548192600","id":38548192600,"full_name":"Jorge Poco","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University"]}},{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38228713200","id":38228713200,"full_name":"Harish Doraiswamy","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University"]}},{"affiliation":"U.S. Geological Survey","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085626687","id":37085626687,"full_name":"Marian Talbert","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["U.S. Geological Survey"]}},{"affiliation":"U.S. Geological Survey","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37269669400","id":37269669400,"full_name":"Jeffrey Morisette","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["U.S. Geological Survey"]}},{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275249200","id":37275249200,"full_name":"Cláudio T.

These models are typically high dimensional scalar functions, where the dimensions of the domain correspond to predictor variables of the model algorithm. Understanding and exploring the differences between models help ecologists understand areas where their data or understanding of the system is incomplete and will help guide further investigation in these regions. These differences can also indicate an important source of model to model uncertainty. However, it is cumbersome and often impractical to perform this analysis using existing tools, which allows for manual exploration of the models usually as 1-dimensional curves. In this paper, we propose a topology-based framework to help ecologists explore the differences in various SDMs directly in the high dimensional domain. In order to accomplish this, we introduce the concept of maximum topology matching that computes a locality-aware correspondence between similar extrema of two scalar functions. The matching is then used to compute the similarity between two functions. We also design a visualization interface that allows ecologists to explore SDMs using their topological features and to study the differences between pairs of models found using maximum topological matching. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework through several use cases using different data sets and report the feedback obtained from ecologists.","article_number":"7429486","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7429486","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429486/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429486/","publication_title":"2015 IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference (SciVis)","conference_location":"Chicago, IL, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2015","publication_number":7411953,"is_number":7429473,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2015","start_page":"9","end_page":"16","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":198,"insert_date":"20160310","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Biological system modeling","Topology","Vegetation","Data models","Predictive models","Data visualization","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Function similarity","computational topology","species distribution models","persistence","high dimensional visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Differences In Models","Species Distribution Models","Ecological Niche Modeling","Niche Modeling","High-dimensional","High-dimensional Space","Understanding Of System","Functional Dimensions","Pair Of Models","Maximum Matching","Visual Interface","High-dimensional Functions","High-dimensional Mapping","Value Function","Critical Point","Similarity Measure","Similarity Metrics","Response Curves","Parameter Space","Topological Structure","Edge Weights","Perfect Match","Similar Topology","Extreme Points","Vertices","Vertices Of The Graph","Isolated Vertices","Merging Algorithm","Merge Tree","Persistent Features","Persistent Characteristics","Matched Pairs","Joining Tree","Junction Tree","Tree-decomposition","Use Case Scenarios","Sublevel Set","Superlevel Sets","Upper Triangular","Upper Triangular Matrix","Upper Triangular Matrices","Lower Triangular","Lower Triangular Matrix","Pair Of Functions","Neighborhood Radius"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9785-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/SciVis.2015.7429489","title":"Real-time uncertainty visualization for B-mode ultrasound","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-9785-8","rank":28,"authors":{"authors":[{"authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087067875","id":37087067875,"full_name":"Christian Schulte Zu Berge","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":null}},{"affiliation":"Intelligent Robotics Institute, Beijing Institute of Technology, Haidian District, Beijing, CHINA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085716865","id":37085716865,"full_name":"Denis Declara","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Intelligent Robotics Institute, Beijing Institute of Technology, Haidian District, Beijing, CHINA"]}},{"affiliation":"Intelligent Robotics Institute, Beijing Institute of Technology, Haidian District, Beijing, CHINA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085358648","id":37085358648,"full_name":"Christoph Hennersperger","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Intelligent Robotics Institute, Beijing Institute of Technology, Haidian District, Beijing, CHINA"]}},{"affiliation":"Intelligent Robotics Institute, Beijing Institute of Technology, Haidian District, Beijing, CHINA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37944985900","id":37944985900,"full_name":"Maximilian Baust","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Intelligent Robotics Institute, Beijing Institute of Technology, Haidian District, Beijing, CHINA"]}},{"affiliation":"Intelligent Robotics Institute, Beijing Institute of Technology, Haidian District, Beijing, CHINA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282965500","id":37282965500,"full_name":"Nassir Navab","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Intelligent Robotics Institute, Beijing Institute of Technology, Haidian District, Beijing, CHINA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"B-mode ultrasound is a very well established imaging modality and is widely used in many of today's clinical routines. However, acquiring good images and interpreting them correctly is a challenging task due to the complex ultrasound image formation process depending on a large number of parameters. To facilitate ultrasound acquisitions, we introduce a novel framework for real-time uncertainty visualization in B-mode images. We compute real-time per-pixel ultrasound Confidence Maps, which we fuse with the original ultrasound image in order to provide the user with an interactive feedback on the quality and credibility of the image. In addition to a standard color overlay mode, primarily intended for educational purposes, we propose two perceptional visualization schemes to be used in clinical practice. Our mapping of uncertainty to chroma uses the perceptionally uniform L*a*b* color space to ensure that the perceived brightness of B-mode ultrasound remains the same. The alternative mapping of uncertainty to fuzziness keeps the B-mode image in its original grayscale domain and locally blurs or sharpens the image based on the uncertainty distribution. An elaborate evaluation of our system and user studies on both medical students and expert sonographers demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed technique. In particular for ultrasound novices, such as medical students, our technique yields powerful visual cues to evaluate the image quality and thereby learn the ultrasound image formation process. Furthermore, seeing the distribution of uncertainty adjust to the transducer positioning in real-time, provides also expert clinicians with a strong visual feedback on their actions. This helps them to optimize the acoustic window and can improve the general clinical value of ultrasound.","article_number":"7429489","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7429489","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429489/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429489/","publication_title":"2015 IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference (SciVis)","conference_location":"Chicago, IL, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2015","publication_number":7411953,"is_number":7429473,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2015","start_page":"33","end_page":"40","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":401,"insert_date":"20160310","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Ultrasonic imaging","Uncertainty","Visualization","Image color analysis","Real-time systems","Biomedical imaging"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Ultrasound","Uncertainty Visualization","Confidence Maps","Real-time"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Real-time Visualization","Uncertainty Visualization","Image Quality","Medical Students","User Study","Ultrasound Imaging","Color Space","Color Components","Images In Order","Visual Strategies","B-mode Images","Feedback Interactions","Real-time Mapping","Real-time Function","Strong Feedback","Uncertainty Distribution","Confidence Map","Ultrasound Processing","Image Formation Process","Changes In Distribution","Diagnostic Value","Spatial Domain","Temporal Domain","Uncertainty Information","HSV Color","HSV Color Space","Hue, Saturation, Value","Hue-saturation-value","B-mode Ultrasound Images","Uncertainty Map","Iterative Solver","Uncertainty Region","Mapping Strategy","Mapping Scheme","Human Vision","Human Visual Perception","Medical Training"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9785-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/SciVis.2015.7429490","title":"Explicit frequency control for high-quality texture-based flow visualization","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-9785-8","rank":29,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Saarland University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38236609900","id":38236609900,"full_name":"Victor Matvienko","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Saarland University"]}},{"affiliation":"University Duisburg-Essen","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37548560500","id":37548560500,"full_name":"Jens Krüger","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University Duisburg-Essen"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"In this work we propose an effective method for frequency-controlled dense flow visualization derived from a generalization of the Line Integral Convolution (LIC) technique. Our approach consists in considering the spectral properties of the dense flow visualization process as an integral operator defined in a local curvilinear coordinate system aligned with the flow. Exploring LIC from this point of view, we suggest a systematic way to design a flow visualization process with particular local spatial frequency properties of the resulting image. Our method is efficient, intuitive, and based on a long-standing model developed as a result of numerous perception studies. The method can be described as an iterative application of line integral convolution, followed by a one-dimensional Gabor filtering orthogonal to the flow. To demonstrate the utility of the technique, we generated novel adaptive multi-frequency flow visualizations, that according to our evaluation, feature a higher level of frequency control and higher quality scores than traditional approaches in texture-based flow visualization.","article_number":"7429490","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7429490","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429490/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429490/","publication_title":"2015 IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference (SciVis)","conference_location":"Chicago, IL, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2015","publication_number":7411953,"is_number":7429473,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2015","start_page":"41","end_page":"48","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":172,"insert_date":"20160310","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Frequency control","Convolution","Kernel","Frequency-domain analysis","Context"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["flow visualization","texture-based visualization","LIC","Gabor filter","spatial frequency","image contrast"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Frequency Control","Flow Visualization","Visual Methods","Local Frequency","Integral Operator","Gabor Filters","Curvilinear Coordinates","Coordination Parameters","Streamline","Frequency Domain","Flow Direction","High Contrast","Visual Images","Visual Inspection Of Images","Flow Field","Adaptive Control","Gaussian Filter","Convolution Kernel","Specific Frequency","Vector Field","Variation In Direction","Orthogonal Directions","Frequency Adaptation","Spectral Theory","Short-time Fourier Transform","Van Wijk","Noise Injection","Human Visual System","Motion Field","Steady Flow","Unsteady Flow","Visualization Purposes","Separable Convolution"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9785-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/SciVis.2015.7429483","title":"VIS capstone address: Architectures physical and digital","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-9785-8","rank":30,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Carnegie Mellon","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088747825","id":37088747825,"full_name":"Molly Wright Steenson","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Carnegie Mellon"]}}]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"How do computer architectures and physical architectures inform each other?

It is also an increasingly popular means of presenting large scientific datasets to the general public in informal educational settings such as museums and planetaria. Visualization has appeared in many forms and in many cultures throughout digital history and contributes to the evolving visual language of science. Dr. Donna Cox and the Advanced Visualization Laboratory team at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, University of Illinois, collaborate with science teams, writers, producers, educators, and media distribution professionals on content designed to engage a wide range of audiences. In the past 8 years alone, her collaborative educational and outreach projects have produced science narratives featuring data visualizations that have been viewed by more than 45 million people worldwide. Cox leads an NSF-funded project to create scientific visualizations and then test audiences' understanding of the phenomenon that is being presented. Large-scale computational data present unique visualization challenges for producers of high-resolution, production-quality 3D IMAX movies; feature films; and museum fulldomes. In this keynote, Cox will provide a visual feast of major projects, including new digital fulldome museum shows and award-winning IMAX films.","article_number":"7429482","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7429482","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429482/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429482/","publication_title":"2015 IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference (SciVis)","conference_location":"Chicago, IL, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2015","publication_number":7411953,"is_number":7429473,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2015","start_page":"1","end_page":"1","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":130,"insert_date":"20160310","index_terms":{},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9785-8","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/SciVis.2015.7429477","title":"Preface","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-9785-8","rank":34,"authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Presents the introductory welcome message from the conference proceedings.
