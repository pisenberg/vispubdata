For further analysis these missing values need to be imputed. Thus, imputation of such missing values is important in a wide range of applications. We propose a visually and statistically guided imputation approach, that allows applying different imputation techniques to estimate the missing values as well as evaluating and fine tuning the imputation by visual guidance. In our approach we include additional visual information about uncertainty and employ the cyclic structure of time inherent in the data. Including this cyclic structure enables visually judging the adequateness of the estimated values with respect to the uncertainty/error boundaries and according to the patterns of the neighbouring time points in linear and cyclic (e.g., the months of the year) time.","article_number":"7347672","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347672","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347672/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347672/","publication_title":"2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Chicago, IL, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2015","publication_number":7337653,"is_number":7347613,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2015","start_page":"189","end_page":"190","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":319,"insert_date":"20151207","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Time series analysis","Uncertainty","Visualization","Statistical analysis","Data visualization","Electronic mail","Market research"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Time Series","Missing Values","Seasonal Time Series","Multiple Imputation","Imputed Data","Real-world Applications","Cycle Time","Linear Time","Imputed Values","Cyclic Structure","Visual Guidance","Confidence Interval","Statistical Methods","Statistical Procedures","Seasonal Cycle","Seasonal Period","Detailed View","Error Bounds","Multivariate Time Series","Univariate Time Series","Neighboring Values","Values In The Neighborhood","Multiple Imputation Techniques"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9783-4","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2015.7347682","title":"TimeStitch: Interactive multi-focus cohort discovery and comparison","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-9783-4","rank":2,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Georgia Tech","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085630971","id":37085630971,"full_name":"Peter J.

In 2001, Barnes and Roeder defined a set of contours corresponding to compositional fields for spinel group minerals. Geologists typically use this contours to estimate the tectonic environment where a particular spinel composition could have been formed. This task is prone to errors and requires tedious manual comparison of overlapping diagrams. We introduce a semi-automatic, interactive detection of tectonic settings for an arbitrary dataset based on the Barnes and Roeder contours. The new approach integrates the mentioned contours and includes a novel interaction called contour brush. The new methodology is integrated in the Spinel Explorer system and it improves the scientist's workflow significantly.","article_number":"7347676","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347676","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347676/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347676/","publication_title":"2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Chicago, IL, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2015","publication_number":7337653,"is_number":7347613,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2015","start_page":"197","end_page":"198","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":102,"insert_date":"20151207","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Minerals","Brushes","Three-dimensional displays","Rocks","Manuals","Standards"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive","Spinel Group","Spinel Group Minerals","Tectonic Setting","Tectonic Environment","User Data","Quantitative Information","Domain Experts"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9783-4","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2015.7347639","title":"VAST challenge 2015: Grand challenge - Team VADER/VIS Award for Outstanding Comprehensive Submission","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-9783-4","rank":16,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085720353","id":37085720353,"full_name":"Michael Steptoe","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085432818","id":37085432818,"full_name":"Robert Krueger","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Electronic Science and Engineering, University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087609319","id":37087609319,"full_name":"Yifan Zhang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Science and Technology on Near-Surface Detection Laboratory, Wuxi, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087942174","id":37087942174,"full_name":"Xing Liang","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Science and Technology on Near-Surface Detection Laboratory, Wuxi, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Science and Technology on Near-Surface Detection Laboratory, Wuxi, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085722063","id":37085722063,"full_name":"Rolando Garcia","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Science and Technology on Near-Surface Detection Laboratory, Wuxi, China"]}},{"authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085724334","id":37085724334,"full_name":"Sagarika Kadambi","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":null}},{"authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085727898","id":37085727898,"full_name":"Wei Luo","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":null}},{"authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268023800","id":37268023800,"full_name":"Thomas Ertl","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":null}},{"authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396008400","id":37396008400,"full_name":"Ross Maciejewski","author_order":9,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":null}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"The VAST 2015 Grand Challenge focused on a fictional park called DinoFunWorld where visitors are provided with a handheld device for communicating with park patrons and registering their visits to rides.

We answer some of the challenge questions and plan further research on data exploration and analysis based on the newly introduced data model, interaction, and views.","article_number":"7347663","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347663","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347663/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347663/","publication_title":"2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Chicago, IL, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2015","publication_number":7337653,"is_number":7347613,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2015","start_page":"167","end_page":"168","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":94,"insert_date":"20151207","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Trajectory","Data models","Brushes","Tracking","Heating","Standards","Electronic mail"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Exploratory Data","View In Order","Time Series","Daily Visits"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9783-4","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2015.7347667","title":"Spectrum: A visual analytics tool to explore movement logs","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-9783-4","rank":21,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087856411","id":37087856411,"full_name":"Junpeng Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087167237","id":37087167237,"full_name":"Ji Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37419565900","id":37419565900,"full_name":"Chris North","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"We present a visual analytics tool, called Spectrum, to analyze the movement and communication log data from VAST Challenge 2015. Spectrum has two views: MoveView and SpectrumView. MoveView gives an overview of the movement logs at a certain timestamp by synthesizing time, location and identity information. It replays movement logs over time and demonstrates communication logs with dynamic links. SpectrumView shows the status of all visitors' activities within a period of time. Each stay of visitors in a location is visualized as a line segment. The duration and location type of the stay are encoded by the length and color of the segment. Accumulating segments of the same visitor horizontally and aligning sequences of segments from different visitors form a general view of all visitors' activities. In our attempt to solve the VAST Challenge 2015, we find that Spectrum provides an intuitive overview of the log data and helps to discover movement patterns from a large number of log records.","article_number":"7347667","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347667","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347667/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347667/","publication_title":"2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Chicago, IL","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2015","publication_number":7337653,"is_number":7347613,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2015","start_page":"175","end_page":"176","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":117,"insert_date":"20151207","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Tracking","Sorting","Image color analysis","Electronic mail","Logic gates"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visualization Tool","Visual Analytics Tool","Local Information","Movement Patterns","Data Logger","Line Segment","Dynamic Link","Overview Of Problems","Local Coordinate","Communication Links","Group Visits","Overview Of Activities","Park Visitors","Activity In Parks"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9783-4","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2015.7347671","title":"Visual scalability of spatial ensemble uncertainty","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-9783-4","rank":22,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Mississippi State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38578315200","id":38578315200,"full_name":"Sujan Anreddy","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Mississippi State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Mississippi State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37277708500","id":37277708500,"full_name":"Song Zhang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Mississippi State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Mississippi State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590976900","id":37590976900,"full_name":"Andrew Mercer","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Mississippi State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Mississippi State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37408980300","id":37408980300,"full_name":"Jamie Dyer","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Mississippi State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Mississippi State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38576023600","id":38576023600,"full_name":"J.

These simulations are often used by weather analysts to analyze the nature of uncertainty attributed by these simulations to forecast weather conditions with good accuracy. The number of simulations used for forecasting is growing with the advent of increase in computing power. Hence, there is a need for providing better visual insights of uncertainty with growing number of ensemble members. We propose a geo visual analytical framework that uses visual analytics approach to resolve visual scalability of these ensemble members. Our approach naturally fits with the workflow of an analyst analyzing ensemble spatial uncertainty. Meteorologists evaluated our framework qualitatively and found it to be effective in acquiring insights of spatial uncertainty associated with multiple ensemble runs that are simulated using multiple parameterization schemes.","article_number":"7347671","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347671","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347671/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347671/","publication_title":"2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Chicago, IL, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2015","publication_number":7337653,"is_number":7347613,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2015","start_page":"187","end_page":"188","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":171,"insert_date":"20151207","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty","Visualization","Numerical models","Space exploration","Image color analysis","Weather forecasting"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Spatial Uncertainty","Ensemble Uncertainty","Forecasting","Cumulus","Ensemble Members","Numerical Weather Prediction","Weather Models","Parameterization Schemes","Strategy Parameters","Weather Research","Visual Framework","Weather Research And Forecasting","Microphysics Scheme","Number Of Ensemble Members","Pairwise Comparisons","Visualization Techniques","Noodles","Planetary Boundary Layer","Free Atmosphere","Atmospheric Boundary Layer","Uncertainty Distribution","Spatial Space","Individual Ensemble"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9783-4","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2015.7347677","title":"A System for visual exploration of caution spots from vehicle recorder data","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-9783-4","rank":23,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"The University of Tokyo, National Institute of Information and Communications Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37534010200","id":37534010200,"full_name":"Masahiko Itoh","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The University of Tokyo, National Institute of Information and Communications Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"The University of Tokyo","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073982600","id":37073982600,"full_name":"Daisaku Yokoyama","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The University of Tokyo"]}},{"affiliation":"The University of Tokyo","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37328454400","id":37328454400,"full_name":"Masashi Toyoda","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The University of Tokyo"]}},{"affiliation":"National Institute of Informatics, The University of Tokyo","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283954000","id":37283954000,"full_name":"Masaru Kitsuregawa","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["National Institute of Informatics, The University of Tokyo"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"It is vital for the transportation industry, which performs most of its work by automobiles, to reduce its accident rate.

In this work, we address the issue by leveraging the real music streaming log data as an example to better understand a million-scale dataset. Trending event explanation turns out to be challenging when it comes to categorical log data. Therefore, we propose to use a learning-based method with an interface design to uncover the trending event compositions for time-series categorical log data, which can be extend to other datasets, e.g., the hashtags in social media. First, we perform “trending pool” operation to save the memory and time cost. Second, we apply sparse coding to learn important trending candidate combination sets instead of traditional brute-force way or manual investigation for generating combinations. Besides the contributions above, we also observe some interesting user behaviors by exploring detected trending candidate combinations visually through our interface.","article_number":"7347688","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347688","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347688/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347688/","publication_title":"2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Chicago, IL, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2015","publication_number":7337653,"is_number":7347613,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2015","start_page":"221","end_page":"222","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":394,"insert_date":"20151207","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Encoding","Market research","Visual analytics","Image color analysis","Layout","Learning systems","Music"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","time-series","categorical data"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Categorical Data","Data Logger","Social Media","Social Platforms","Learning-based Methods","Memory Cost","Sparse Coding","Logarithm Of The Number","Log Number","Codeword"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9783-4","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2015.7347657","title":"ParkVis: Visual analytic system for communication data in DinoFun World","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-9783-4","rank":35,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085659211","id":37085659211,"full_name":"Abishek Puri","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087587861","id":37087587861,"full_name":"Dongyu Liu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087585710","id":37087585710,"full_name":"Shaoyu Chen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087589099","id":37087589099,"full_name":"Siwei Fu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087337988","id":37087337988,"full_name":"Tianyu Wang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087588582","id":37087588582,"full_name":"Yeukyin Chan","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087588411","id":37087588411,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"We propose ParkVis, a visual analytic system for tracking the communication trends of all paying park visitors.

A key challenge is selecting a study cohort from the available data, or “pruning” the data, in a way that produces both sufficient balance in pre-treatment covariates and an easily described cohort from which results can be generalized. Even with advanced pruning methods, it is often difficult for researchers to see how the cohort is being selected; consequently, these methods are underutilized in research. Visual Pruner is a free, easy-to-use web application that can improve both the credibility and generalizability of observational studies by letting analysts use updatable visual displays of estimated propensity scores and key baseline covariates to refine inclusion criteria. By helping researchers see how covariate distributions in their data relate to the estimated probabilities of treatment assignment, the app lets researchers make pruning decisions based on pre-treatment covariate patterns that are otherwise hard to discover. The app yields a set of inclusion criteria that can be used in conjunction with further statistical analysis in any statistical software.","article_number":"7347685","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347685","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347685/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347685/","publication_title":"2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Chicago, IL, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2015","publication_number":7337653,"is_number":7347613,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2015","start_page":"215","end_page":"216","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":82,"insert_date":"20151207","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Histograms","Probability","Software","Analytical models","Sociology"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["G.3 [Probability and Statistics]: Statistical Software","G.3 [Probability and Statistics]: Experimental design"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Observational Studies","Population-based Study","Inclusion Criteria","Propensity Score","Web Application","Baseline Covariates","Distribution Of Covariates","Estimated Propensity Scores","Set Of Inclusion Criteria","Pruning Method","Statistical Models","R Foundation","R Code","R Foundation For Statistical Computing","Basal Rate","Overlap Area","Propensity Score Model","Propensity Score Distribution","Covariate Space"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9783-4","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2015.7347652","title":"Case study of dino fun world movement and communication data","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-9783-4","rank":45,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"SAS Institute","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085675299","id":37085675299,"full_name":"Jordan Riley Benson","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SAS Institute"]}},{"affiliation":"SAS Institute","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085676748","id":37085676748,"full_name":"Rajiv Ramarajan","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SAS Institute"]}},{"affiliation":"SAS Institute","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085675127","id":37085675127,"full_name":"Nascif Abousalh-Neto","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SAS Institute"]}},{"affiliation":"SAS Institute","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085671046","id":37085671046,"full_name":"Paul Vezzetti","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SAS Institute"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"We present our solution to the VAST 2015 Mini-challenge 1.

These decisions are critical in enabling vibrant, sustainable environments but must also negotiate a range of complex political and social forces. This requires those shaping the built environment to balance maximizing the value of a new development with its impact on the character of a neighborhood. As a result architects are focused on two issues throughout the decision making process: a) what defines the character of a neighborhood? and b) how will a new development change its neighborhood? In the first, character can be influenced by a variety of factors and understanding the interplay between diverse data sets is crucial; including safety, transportation access, school quality and access to entertainment. In the second, the impact of a new development is measured, for example, by how it impacts the view from the buildings that surround it. In this paper, we work in collaboration with architects to design Urbane, a 3-dimensional multi-resolution framework that enables a data-driven approach for decision making in the design of new urban development. This is accomplished by integrating multiple data layers and impact analysis techniques facilitating architects to explore and assess the effect of these attributes on the character and value of a neighborhood. Several of these data layers, as well as impact analysis, involve working in 3-dimensions and operating in real time. Efficient computation and visualization is accomplished through the use of techniques from computer graphics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Urbane through a case study of development in Manhattan depicting how a data-driven understanding of the value and impact of speculative buildings can benefit the design-development process between architects, planners and developers.","article_number":"7347636","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347636","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347636/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347636/","publication_title":"2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Chicago, IL, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2015","publication_number":7337653,"is_number":7347613,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2015","start_page":"97","end_page":"104","citing_paper_count":35,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1229,"insert_date":"20151207","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Buildings","Cities and towns","Three-dimensional displays","Data visualization","Decision making","Visualization","Stakeholders"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Urban data analysis","GIS","impact analysis","visual analytics","architecture","city development"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Urban Development","Computational Efficiency","Urban Planning","City Planning","Local Planning","Analysis Of The Impact","Social Forces","Social Force Model","Impact Of Development","Evolutionary Impact","Data Layers","Development Of Values","New Urban","Computer Graphics","Value Of Buildings","Physical Aspects","New Building","Neighborhood Level","OpenStreetMap","City Streets","City Road","Triangular Mesh","Triangle Mesh","2D Data","2D Layers","Urban Data","Urban Dataset","Neighborhood Quality","Aspects Of The City","Kernel Computation","Kernel Calculation","Map View","2D Datasets","Floor Plate","City Building","Visual Interface","Parallel Coordinates"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9783-4","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2015.7347634","title":"Comparative visual analysis of vector field ensembles","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-9783-4","rank":54,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Technische Universität München","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085704850","id":37085704850,"full_name":"Mihaela Jarema","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technische Universität München"]}},{"affiliation":"Technische Universität München","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085574383","id":37085574383,"full_name":"Ismail Demir","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technische Universität München"]}},{"affiliation":"Technische Universität München","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546620000","id":37546620000,"full_name":"Johannes Kehrer","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technische Universität München"]}},{"affiliation":"Technische Universität München","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37444424000","id":37444424000,"full_name":"Rüdiger Westermann","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technische Universität München"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"We present a new visual analysis approach to support the comparative exploration of 2D vector-valued ensemble fields.

For this purpose, directional data is modelled using mixtures of probability density functions (pdfs), which allows us to characterize and classify complex distributions with relatively few parameters. The resulting mixture models are used to determine the degree of similarity between ensemble members, and to construct glyphs showing the direction, spread, and strength of the principal modes of the directional distributions. We also propose several similarity measures, based on which we compute pairwise member similarities in the spatial domain and form clusters of similar members. The hierarchical clustering is shown using dendrograms and similarity matrices, which can be used to select particular members and visualize their variations.

Visual analytic tools provide interactive visual interfaces to data to support discovery and sensemaking tasks, including forming hypotheses, asking questions, and evaluating and organizing evidence. Myriad analytic models can be incorporated into visual analytic systems at the cost of increasing complexity in the analytic discourse between user and system. Techniques exist to increase the usability of interacting with analytic models, such as inferring data models from user interactions to steer the underlying models of the system via semantic interaction, shielding users from having to do so explicitly. Such approaches are often also referred to as mixed-initiative systems. Sensemaking researchers have called for development of tools that facilitate analytic sensemaking through a combination of human and automated activities. However, design guidelines do not exist for mixed-initiative visual analytic systems to support iterative sensemaking. In this paper, we present candidate design guidelines and introduce the Active Data Environment (ADE) prototype, a spatial workspace supporting the analytic process via task recommendations invoked by inferences about user interactions within the workspace. ADE recommends data and relationships based on a task model, enabling users to co-reason with the system about their data in a single, spatial workspace. This paper provides an illustrative use case, a technical description of ADE, and a discussion of the strengths and limitations of the approach.","article_number":"7347625","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347625","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347625/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347625/","publication_title":"2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Chicago, IL, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2015","publication_number":7337653,"is_number":7347613,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2015","start_page":"9","end_page":"16","citing_paper_count":24,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":771,"insert_date":"20151207","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Data models","Analytical models","Data visualization","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["mixed-initiative visual analytics","task modeling","recommender systems","sensemaking"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Semantic","Analytical Tools","Workspace","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Design Guidelines","Interactive Visualization","Iterative Process","Specific Tasks","User Data","Application Programming Interface","Programming Interface","Action Recognition","Data Retrieval","Usual Conditions","User Status","Current Task","Recommender Systems","Analytical Reasoning","Relevance Score","Named Entity Recognition","Entity Extraction","Third-party Tools","Current Prototype","Relevant Probabilities","Analysis Of Users","User Tasks","Sense-making Process","Provider Recommendation","Supplier Recommendations","Google Earth","Visual Metaphors","Active Users"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9783-4","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2015.7347624","title":"Wavelet-based visualization of time-varying data on graphs","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-9783-4","rank":56,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of São Paulo","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085717328","id":37085717328,"full_name":"Paola Valdivia","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of São Paulo"]}},{"affiliation":"University of São Paulo","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085716146","id":37085716146,"full_name":"Fabio Dias","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of São Paulo"]}},{"affiliation":"UFES","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37829338000","id":37829338000,"full_name":"Fabiano Petronetto","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UFES"]}},{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275249200","id":37275249200,"full_name":"Cláudio T.

Although techniques based on aggregation, topology, and topic modeling have proven their usefulness, the visual analysis of smooth and/or abrupt data variations as well as the evolution of such variations over time are aspects not properly tackled by existing methods. In this work we propose a novel visualization methodology that relies on graph wavelet theory and stacked graph metaphor to enable the visual analysis of time-varying data defined on the nodes of a graph. The proposed method is able to identify regions where data presents abrupt and mild spacial and/or temporal variation while still been able to show how such changes evolve over time, making the identification of events an easier task. The usefulness of our approach is shown through a set of results using synthetic as well as a real data set involving taxi trips in downtown Manhattan. The methodology was able to reveal interesting phenomena and events such as the identification of specific locations with abrupt variation in the number of taxi pickups.","article_number":"7347624","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347624","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347624/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347624/","publication_title":"2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Chicago, IL, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2015","publication_number":7337653,"is_number":7347613,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2015","start_page":"1","end_page":"8","citing_paper_count":18,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":876,"insert_date":"20151207","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Wavelet analysis","Public transportation","Roads","Wavelet transforms","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Time-varying data","graph wavelets","stacked graph visualization"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Time-varying Data","Visual Analysis","Nodes In The Graph","Topic Modeling","Abrupt Variations","Visual Analysis Of Data","Visual Methodology","Time Series","Eigenvectors","Abrupt Changes","Massive Data","Symmetric Matrix","Symmetric Matrices","Wavelet Transform","Wavelet Coefficients","Dot Product","Kronecker Product","Information Changes","Frequent Class","Time Slice","Spectral Graph Theory","Graph Spectrum","Node Classification","Time-varying Function","River Terraces","Linear Graph","Path Graph","Adjacent Slices","Rush Hour","Training Data","Pattern Classification","Temporal Changes"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9783-4","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2015.7347630","title":"iVizTRANS: Interactive visual learning for home and work place detection from massive public transportation data","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-9783-4","rank":57,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085671750","id":37085671750,"full_name":"Liang Yu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38066979600","id":38066979600,"full_name":"Wei Wu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085739394","id":37085739394,"full_name":"Xiaohui Li","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085727868","id":37085727868,"full_name":"Guangxia Li","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38192950700","id":38192950700,"full_name":"Wee Siong Ng","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271680100","id":37271680100,"full_name":"See-Kiong Ng","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"]}},{"affiliation":"Urban Redevelopment Authority, Singapore","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085733259","id":37085733259,"full_name":"Zhongwen Huang","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Urban Redevelopment Authority, Singapore"]}},{"affiliation":"Urban Redevelopment Authority, Singapore","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085732289","id":37085732289,"full_name":"Anushiya Arunan","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Urban Redevelopment Authority, Singapore"]}},{"affiliation":"Urban Redevelopment Authority, Singapore","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085727765","id":37085727765,"full_name":"Hui Min Watt","author_order":9,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Urban Redevelopment Authority, Singapore"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Using transport smart card transaction data to understand the homework dynamics of a city for urban planning is emerging as an alternative to traditional surveys which may be conducted every few years are no longer effective and efficient for the rapidly transforming modern cities.

Due to its high input dimensionality, time requirements, and resource constraints, simulating over the entire parameter space is unfeasible. One solution is to take a granular sampling of the input space and use simpler predictive models (emulators) in between. The quality of the implemented emulator depends on many factors: robustness, sophistication, configuration, and suitability to the input data. Visual analytics can be leveraged to provide guidance and understanding of these things to the user. In this paper, we have implemented a novel interface and workflow for emulator building and use. We introduce a workflow to build emulators, make predictions, and then analyze the results. Our prediction process first predicts temporal time series, and uses these to derive predicted spatial densities. Integrated into the EpiSimS framework, we target users who are non-experts at statistical modeling. This approach allows for a high level of analysis into the state of the built emulators and their resultant predictions. We present our workflow, models, the associated system, and evaluate the overall utility with feedback from EpiSimS scientists.","article_number":"7347626","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347626","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347626/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347626/","publication_title":"2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Chicago, IL","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2015","publication_number":7337653,"is_number":7347613,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2015","start_page":"17","end_page":"24","citing_paper_count":14,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":618,"insert_date":"20151207","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Predictive models","Robustness","Information systems","Visual analytics","Yttrium"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Predictive Modeling","Visual Analytics","Epidemic Visualization","Spatial-Temporal Systems"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Prediction Analysis","Prediction Model","Time Series","Parameter Space","Visual Analysis","Entire Parameter Space","Non-parametric","Non-parametric Test","Disease Transmission","Disease Spread","Akaike Information Criterion","Akaike Criterion","Akaike Information Criteria","Input Parameters","Bayesian Information Criterion","Bayesian Information Criteria","Bar Charts","Individual Locations","Red Bars","Time Series Prediction","Time-series Forecasting","Mean Square Error Values","Spatial Prediction","Statistical Metrics","Line Chart","Radar Plot","Main Panel","Spatial Panel","Time Series Plots","Temporal Prediction","Temporal Anticipation","Parallel Coordinates","Map View","Chikungunya","Mean Square Error","Mean Square Deviation","Stepwise Selection"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9783-4","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2015.7347635","title":"Interactive visual steering of hierarchical simulation ensembles","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-9783-4","rank":59,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center in Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085338700","id":37085338700,"full_name":"Rainer Splechtna","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VRVis Research Center in Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center in Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37947312900","id":37947312900,"full_name":"Krešimir Matković","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VRVis Research Center in Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37323697500","id":37323697500,"full_name":"Denis Gračanin","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"AVL-AST, Zagreb, Croatia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085338297","id":37085338297,"full_name":"Mario Jelović","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["AVL-AST, Zagreb, Croatia"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Bergen, Norway","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274158800","id":37274158800,"full_name":"Helwig Hauser","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bergen, Norway"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Multi-level simulation models, i.e., models where different components are simulated using sub-models of varying levels of complexity, belong to the current state-of-the-art in simulation. The existing analysis practice for multi-level simulation results is to manually compare results from different levels of complexity, amounting to a very tedious and error-prone, trial-and-error exploration process. In this paper, we introduce hierarchical visual steering, a new approach to the exploration and design of complex systems. Hierarchical visual steering makes it possible to explore and analyze hierarchical simulation ensembles at different levels of complexity. At each level, we deal with a dynamic simulation ensemble - the ensemble grows during the exploration process. There is at least one such ensemble per simulation level, resulting in a collection of dynamic ensembles, analyzed simultaneously. The key challenge is to map the multi-dimensional parameter space of one ensemble to the multi-dimensional parameter space of another ensemble (from another level). In order to support the interactive visual analysis of such complex data we propose a novel approach to interactive and semi-automatic parameter space segmentation and comparison. The approach combines a novel interaction technique and automatic, computational methods - clustering, concave hull computation, and concave polygon overlapping - to support the analysts in the cross-ensemble parameter space mapping. In addition to the novel parameter space segmentation we also deploy coordinated multiple views with standard plots. We describe the abstract analysis tasks, identified during a case study, i.e., the design of a variable valve actuation system of a car engine. The study is conducted in cooperation with experts from the automotive industry. Very positive feedback indicates the usefulness and efficiency of the newly proposed approach.","article_number":"7347635","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347635","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347635/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347635/","publication_title":"2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Chicago, IL, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2015","publication_number":7337653,"is_number":7347613,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2015","start_page":"89","end_page":"96","citing_paper_count":12,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":439,"insert_date":"20151207","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Analytical models","Computational modeling","Aerospace electronics","Visualization","Engines","Complex systems","Valves"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Interactive Visual Analysis","Simulation-Ensemble Steering","Multi-resolution simulation"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Interactive Visualization","Ensemble Simulations","Simulation Results","Complex Systems","Simulation Model","Positive Feedback","Self-reinforcing","Interaction Analysis","Dimensional Space","Multidimensional Space","Level Of Complexity","Parameter Space","Visual Analysis","Analysis Tasks","Internal Combustion Engine","Automotive Engineering","Different Levels Of Complexity","Semi-automatic Segmentation","Dynamic Ensemble","Interactive Segmentation","Time Series","Pairwise Comparisons","Root Mean Square Error","Root-mean-square Deviation","RMSD","RMSE","Control Parameters","Simulation Run","Coarse Model","Output Value","Yield Values","Domain Experts","Initial Ensemble","Scalar Output","Points In Region","Parallel Coordinates","Valve Position"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9783-4","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2015.7347631","title":"DemographicVis: Analyzing demographic information based on user generated content","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-9783-4","rank":60,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"UNC Charlotte","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606064200","id":37606064200,"full_name":"Wenwen Dou","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UNC Charlotte"]}},{"affiliation":"UNC Charlotte","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38236879300","id":38236879300,"full_name":"Isaac Cho","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UNC Charlotte"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Northern Colorado, Greeley, CO, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086711244","id":37086711244,"full_name":"Omar ElTayeby","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Northern Colorado, Greeley, CO, US"]}},{"affiliation":"Korea University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37602784600","id":37602784600,"full_name":"Jaegul Choo","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Korea University"]}},{"affiliation":"Taste Analytics","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601069300","id":37601069300,"full_name":"Xiaoyu Wang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Taste Analytics"]}},{"affiliation":"UNC Charlotte","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300425000","id":37300425000,"full_name":"William Ribarsky","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UNC Charlotte"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"The wide-spread of social media provides unprecedented sources of written language that can be used to model and infer online demographics.

Such features are then analyzed and ranked based on their ability to predict the users' demographic information. To enable interactive demographic analysis, we introduce a web-based visual interface that presents the relationship of the demographic groups, their topic interests, as well as the predictive power of various features.

To handle different scenarios, the underlying automated algorithms are configured using multiple input parameters. However, the influence and interplay of these parameters is often not clear, making exhaustive evaluations necessary. On this account, we propose a visual analytics approach to supporting users in understanding the complex relationships among parameters, recognized activities, and associated accuracies. First, representative parameter settings are determined. Then, the respective output is computed and statistically analyzed to assess parameters' influence in general. Finally, visualizing the parameter settings along with the activities provides overview and allows to investigate the computed results in detail. Coordinated interaction helps to explore dependencies, compare different settings, and examine individual activities. By integrating automated, visual, and interactive means users can select parameter values that meet desired quality criteria. We demonstrate the application of our solution in a use case with realistic complexity, involving a study of human protagonists in daily living with respect to hundreds of parameter settings.","article_number":"7347629","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347629","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347629/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347629/","publication_title":"2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Chicago, IL, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2015","publication_number":7337653,"is_number":7347613,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2015","start_page":"41","end_page":"48","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":424,"insert_date":"20151207","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Time series analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Statistical analysis","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Prediction algorithms"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["I.3.6 [Computing Methodologies]: Computer Graphics—Methodology and Techniques","H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: User Interfaces—Theory and methods"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Action Recognition","Interactive","Visual Approach","Time Series","Time Step","Local Patterns","Influence Of Parameters","Operation Mode","Combination Of Parameters","Global Patterns","Domain Experts","Recognition Performance","Segmentation Results","Categorical Values","Configuration Parameters","Aspects Of The Data","Self-organizing Map","Kohonen","Visual Design","Algorithm Running","Visual Encoding","Interaction Techniques","Stacked Bar","Time Series Segments","Parameter Space","Statistical Analysis Methods","Multivariate Time Series","Univariate Time Series","Horizontal View","Sensor Model","Mode Filter"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9783-4","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2015.7347627","title":"Collaborative visual analysis with RCloud","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-9783-4","rank":63,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Infovisible","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37372818600","id":37372818600,"full_name":"Stephen North","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Infovisible"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Arizona","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550809300","id":37550809300,"full_name":"Carlos Scheidegger","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Arizona"]}},{"affiliation":"AT&T Labs","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37703730700","id":37703730700,"full_name":"Simon Urbanek","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["AT&T Labs"]}},{"affiliation":"AT&T Labs","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085734124","id":37085734124,"full_name":"Gordon Woodhull","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["AT&T Labs"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Consider the emerging role of data science teams embedded in larger organizations. Individual analysts work on loosely related problems, and must share their findings with each other and the organization at large, moving results from exploratory data analyses (EDA) into automated visualizations, diagnostics and reports deployed for wider consumption. There are two problems with the current practice. First, there are gaps in this workflow: EDA is performed with one set of tools, and automated reports and deployments with another. Second, these environments often assume a single-developer perspective, while data scientist teams could get much benefit from easier sharing of scripts and data feeds, experiments, annotations, and automated recommendations, which are well beyond what traditional version control systems provide. We contribute and justify the following three requirements for systems built to support current data science teams and users: discoverability, technology transfer, and coexistence. In addition, we contribute the design and implementation of RCloud, a system that supports the requirements of collaborative data analysis, visualization and web deployment. About 100 people used RCloud for two years. We report on interviews with some of these users, and discuss design decisions, tradeoffs and limitations in comparison to other approaches.","article_number":"7347627","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347627","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347627/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347627/","publication_title":"2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Chicago, IL, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2015","publication_number":7337653,"is_number":7347613,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2015","start_page":"25","end_page":"32","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":381,"insert_date":"20151207","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Data analysis","Visual analytics","Production","Collaboration","Organizations","Electronic mail"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["visual analytics process","provenance","collaboration","visualization","computer-supported cooperative work"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Exploratory Analysis","Exploratory Data Analysis","Data Visualization","Technology Transfer","Version Control System","Source Code","Data Compression","RStudio","Development Environment","Notebook","Design Considerations","Command Line","Topic Modeling","Web Browser","Interactive Visualization","External Processes","Latent Dirichlet Allocation","Shared Environment","Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory Protein","StAR","JavaScript","Function Calls","Web Development","Code Snippets","IPython"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9783-4","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2015.7347632","title":"EgoNetCloud: Event-based egocentric dynamic network visualization","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-9783-4","rank":64,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"SKLCS, Chinese Academy of Sciences","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088074632","id":37088074632,"full_name":"Qingsong Liu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SKLCS, Chinese Academy of Sciences"]}},{"affiliation":"Yahoo Labs, New York","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403239700","id":37403239700,"full_name":"Yifan Hu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Yahoo Labs, New York"]}},{"affiliation":"SKLCS, Chinese Academy of Sciences","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085394737","id":37085394737,"full_name":"Lei Shi","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SKLCS, Chinese Academy of Sciences"]}},{"affiliation":"Academy of Art and Design, Tsinghua University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088078074","id":37088078074,"full_name":"Xinzhu Mu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Academy of Art and Design, Tsinghua University"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085682188","id":37085682188,"full_name":"Yutao Zhang","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37290459900","id":37290459900,"full_name":"Jie Tang","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Event-based egocentric dynamic networks are an important class of networks widely seen in many domains.

In particular, an integrated data processing pipeline is proposed to prune, compress and filter the networks into smaller but salient abstractions. To accommodate the simplified network into the visual design, we introduce a constrained graph layout algorithm on the dynamic network. Through a real-life case study as well as conversations with the domain expert, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the EgoNetCloud design and system in completing analysis tasks on event-based dynamic networks. The user study comparing EgoNetCloud with a working system on academic search confirms the effectiveness and convenience of our visual analytics based approach.","article_number":"7347632","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347632","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347632/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347632/","publication_title":"2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Chicago, IL, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2015","publication_number":7337653,"is_number":7347613,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2015","start_page":"65","end_page":"72","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":533,"insert_date":"20151207","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Layout","Heuristic algorithms","Data visualization","Collaboration","Stress","Clutter"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Dynamic Network","Visual Network","Network Diagram","Dynamic Visualization","Egocentric Network","User Study","Analysis Tasks","Simple Network","Academic Search","Visual Design","Layout Algorithm","Force-directed Layout","Force-directed Algorithm","Graph Layout","Graph Drawing","Temporal Information","Edge Weights","Node Size","Task Accuracy","Weak Connections","Connectivity Graph","Group Of Nodes","Visual Complexity","Spanning Tree","Discrete Time Points","Ordinary Users","Original Message","Sina Weibo","Visual Clutter","Visual Pollution","Street Clutter","Academic Networks","Bird Flu","Trend Graph","Visual Metaphors","Advanced Users","Key People"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9783-4","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2015.7347638","title":"VAST Challenge 2015: Mayhem at dinofun world","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-9783-4","rank":65,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37357067600","id":37357067600,"full_name":"Mark Whiting","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085505404","id":37085505404,"full_name":"Kristin Cook","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Massachusetts Lowell","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37360588500","id":37360588500,"full_name":"Georges Grinstein","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Massachusetts Lowell"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Massachusetts Lowell","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085522319","id":37085522319,"full_name":"John Fallon","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Massachusetts Lowell"]}},{"affiliation":"Air Force Research Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085508309","id":37085508309,"full_name":"Kristen Liggett","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Air Force Research Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"MIT Lincoln Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085713208","id":37085713208,"full_name":"Diane Staheli","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["MIT Lincoln Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"Smith College","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085718680","id":37085718680,"full_name":"Jordan Crouser","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Smith College"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"A fictitious amusement park and a larger-than-life hometown football hero provided participants in the VAST Challenge 2015 with an engaging yet complex storyline and setting in which to analyze movement and communication patterns.

The simplicity of the format belied a complex wealth of features contained in the data that needed to be discovered and understood to solve the tasks and questions that were posed. Two Mini-Challenges and a Grand Challenge compose the 2015 competition. Mini-Challenge 1 contained structured location and date-time data for park visitors, against which participants were to discern groups and their activities. Mini-Challenge 2 contained structured communication data consisting of metadata about time-stamped text messages sent between park visitors. The Grand Challenge required participants to use both movement and communication data to hypothesize when a crime was committed and identify the most likely suspects from all the park visitors. The VAST Challenge 2015 received 71 submissions, and the datasets were downloaded, at least partially, from 26 countries.","article_number":"7347638","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347638","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347638/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347638/","publication_title":"2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Chicago, IL, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2015","publication_number":7337653,"is_number":7347613,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2015","start_page":"113","end_page":"118","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":325,"insert_date":"20151207","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Games","Electronic mail","Visual analytics","Software","Engineering profession","Layout","Videos"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analytics","Human Information Interaction","Sense Making","Movement Analysis","Evaluation","Contest"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Vast Challenges","Submission","Movement Patterns","Communication Patterns","Grand Challenge","Amusement Park","Park Visitors","Science And Technology","Visual Analysis","Visualization Tool","Unusual Patterns","Activity In Parks"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9783-4","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2015.7347633","title":"FPSSeer: Visual analysis of game frame rate data","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-9783-4","rank":66,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"NetEase Games, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087937025","id":37087937025,"full_name":"Quan Li","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["NetEase Games, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"NetEase Games NetEase, Inc.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087183582","id":37087183582,"full_name":"Peng Xu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["NetEase Games NetEase, Inc."]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087588411","id":37087588411,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"The rate at which frames are rendered in a computer game directly influences both game playability and enjoyability. Players frequently have to deal with the trade-off between high frame rates and good resolution. Analyzing patterns in frame rate data and their correlation with the overall game performance is important in designing games (e.g., graphic card/display setting suggestion and game performance measurement). However, this task is challenging because game frame rates vary both temporally and spatially. In addition, players may adjust their display settings based on their gaming experience and hardware conditions, which further contributes to the unpredictability of frame rates. In this paper, we present a comprehensive visual analytics system FPSSeer, to help game designers gain insight into frame rate data. Our system consists of four major views: 1) a frame rate view to show the overall distribution in a geographic scale, 2) a grid view to show the frame rate distribution and grid element clusters based on their similarity, 3) a FootRiver view to reveal the temporal patterns in game condition changes and potential spatiotemporal correlations, and 4) a comparison view to evaluate game performance discrepancy under different game tests. The real-world case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our system. The system has been applied to an online commercial game to monitor its performance and to provide feedbacks to designers and developers.","article_number":"7347633","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347633","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347633/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347633/","publication_title":"2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","conference_location":"Chicago, IL, USA","conference_dates":"25-30 Oct. 2015","publication_number":7337653,"is_number":7347613,"publication_year":2015,"publication_date":"25-30 Oct. 2015","start_page":"73","end_page":"80","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":618,"insert_date":"20151207","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Games","Data visualization","Hardware","Visual analytics","Computers","Correlation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["frame rate data","game performance evaluation","visual analytics"]},"dynamic_index_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Frame Rate","High-resolution","Visual System","Video Games","Computer Games","Game Design","Game Experience","High Frame Rate","Game Performance","Game Conditions","Game State","Grid Elements","Interactive","Time And Space","Spacetime","High-dimensional","High-dimensional Space","Quantitative Measures","Scatter Plot","Human-computer Interaction","User Interaction","Objective Data","Gameplay","Game Development","Game Scenario","Visual Design","Flow Map","Visualization Techniques","Analysis Tasks","Minkowski Distance","Map Design","Cartographic Design","Network Latency","Quantitative Performance Measures"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9783-4","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2015.7347623","title":"VIS capstone address","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4673-9783-4","rank":67,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Carnegie Mellon, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088747825","id":37088747825,"full_name":"Molly Wright Steenson","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Carnegie Mellon, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"How do computer architectures and physical architectures inform each other?
