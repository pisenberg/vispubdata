This paper proposes an alternative method for color compositing. In order to present understandable color blending to the general public, several techniques are proposed. First, a paint-inspired RYB color space is used. In addition, noise patterns are employed to produce subregions of pure color within an overlapped region. We show examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique for visualization.","article_number":"1382898","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1382898","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382898/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382898/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-12 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9496,"is_number":30135,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-12 Oct. 2004","start_page":"113","end_page":"118","citing_paper_count":21,"citing_patent_count":3,"download_count":665,"insert_date":"20050124","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Paints","Colored noise","Computer graphics","Color","Data visualization","Computer displays","Cities and towns","Printers","Art","Wheels"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["RYB","Color Mixing","Perception"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8779-3","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.2004.37","title":"IN-SPIRE InfoVis 2004 Contest Entry","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8779-3","issn":"1522-404X","rank":2,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086987754","id":37086987754,"full_name":"Pak Chung Wong","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"]}},{"affiliation":"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37374614800","id":37374614800,"full_name":"B.

Email interfaces, on the other hand, have gone through very few transformations since their inception, and as the growing volumes of email data accumulate in users' email boxes, these interfaces fail to provide effective message handling and browsing support. Saved email messages provide not only a vast record of one's electronic past, but also a potential source of valuable insights into the structure and dynamics of one's social network. In this paper, we present faMailiar, a novel email visualization that draws upon email's inherently personal character by using intimacy as a key visualization parameter. The program presents a visualization of email use over time. faMailiar facilitates navigation through large email collections, enabling the user to discover communication rhythms and patterns.","article_number":"1382925","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1382925","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382925/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382925/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-12 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9496,"is_number":30135,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-12 Oct. 2004","start_page":"p14","end_page":"p14","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":137,"insert_date":"20050124","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Electronic mail","Pervasive computing","Navigation","Graphical user interfaces","Humans","Information retrieval","Environmental factors","Software libraries","Computer science"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["information visualization","electronic mail"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8779-3","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.2004.45","title":"Major Information Visualization Authors, Papers and Topics in the ACM Library","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8779-3","issn":"1522-404X","rank":6,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Library and Information Science Indiana University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087705936","id":37087705936,"full_name":"Weimao Ke","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Library and Information Science Indiana University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Library and Information Science Indiana University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283464100","id":37283464100,"full_name":"K.

We investigated the use of digital lensing applied to imagery analysis.

Although no lens offset mode was significantly better than another, most participants preferred the adjacent mode for the locate and compare tasks, and the docked mode for the follow tasks.

Lookmarks are pointers to views of specific parts of a dataset. They were so named because lookmarks are to a visualization tool and dataset as bookmarks are to a browser and the World Wide Web. A lookmark can be saved and organized among other lookmarks within the context of ParaView. Then at a later time, either in the same ParaView session or in a different one, it can be regenerated, displaying the exact view of the data that had previously been saved. This allows the user to pick up where they left off, to continue to adjust the view or otherwise manipulate the data. Lookmarks facilitate collaboration between users who wish to share views of a dataset. They enable more effective data comparison because they can be applied to other datasets. They also serve as a way of organizing a user’s data. Ultimately, a lookmark is a time-saving tool that automates the recreation of a complex view of the data.","article_number":"1382930","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1382930","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382930/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382930/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-12 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9496,"is_number":30135,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-12 Oct. 2004","start_page":"p19","end_page":"p19","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":82,"insert_date":"20050124","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Filters","Data visualization","Pipelines","Laboratories","Web sites","Collaboration","Organizing","User interfaces","XML","Computer aided software engineering"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8779-3","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.2004.39","title":"InfoVisExplorer","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8779-3","issn":"1522-404X","rank":26,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"College of Computing/GVU Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087536867","id":37087536867,"full_name":"J.

IRVDX employs three kinds of visualizations: one provides a reduced representation of the data sets, which we call Dataset Icons. These icons show the important statistical characteristics of data sets and help to identify relevant data sets from distributed repositories. Another one is called the Remote Dataset Visual Browser that provides visualizations to browse remote data without downloading the complete data set to identify its content. The final one provides visualizations to show the degree of similarity between two data sets and to visually determine whether a join of two remote data sets will be meaningful.","article_number":"1382923","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1382923","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382923/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382923/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-12 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9496,"is_number":30135,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-12 Oct. 2004","start_page":"p12","end_page":"p12","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":100,"insert_date":"20050124","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data mining","Data visualization","Law","Distributed databases","Visual databases","Statistical distributions","Chromium","Information processing","Information retrieval","Data analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["visual data mining","information visualization","visual data exploration","distributed data"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8779-3","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.2004.20","title":"EventScope: Bringing Remote Experience of Mars to the Public through Telepresence","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8779-3","issn":"1522-404X","rank":30,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Platform Digital Limited Liability Company","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087440941","id":37087440941,"full_name":"E.

One problem often encountered in the process is occlusion: the ambiguity that occurs when records from different data sets are mapped to the same display location. For example, because of occlusion summarizing 1000 graphs by simply stacking them one over another is pointless. We solve this problem by adapting the solution to a similar problem in the Information Murals system [2]: mapping the number of data elements at a location to display luminance. Inspired by histograms, which map data frequency to space, we call our solution histographs. By treating a histograph as a digital image, we can blur and highlight edges to emphasize data features. We also support interactive clustering of the data with data zooming and shape-based selection. We are currently investigating alternative occlusion blending schemes.","article_number":"1382928","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1382928","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382928/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382928/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-12 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9496,"is_number":30135,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-12 Oct. 2004","start_page":"p17","end_page":"p17","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":113,"insert_date":"20050124","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Displays","Frequency","Digital images","Histograms","Image edge detection","Stacking","Chromium","User interfaces","Computer graphics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["information visualization","visualizing large data sets","data occlusion","digital image processing"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8779-3","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.2004.17","title":"Distortion-Based Visualization for Long-Term Continuous Acoustic Monitoring","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8779-3","issn":"1522-404X","rank":36,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Central Research Institute, Electric Power Industry, Japan","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37265724400","id":37265724400,"full_name":"F.

In this paper, we define visual clutter as any aspect of the visualization that interferes with the viewer’s understanding of the data, and present the concept of clutter-based dimension reordering. Dimension order is an attribute that can significantly affect a visualization’s expressiveness. By varying the dimension order in a display, it is possible to reduce clutter without reducing information content or modifying the data in any way. Clutter reduction is a display-dependent task. In this paper, we follow a three-step procedure for four different visualization techniques. For each display technique, first, we determine what constitutes clutter in terms of display properties; then we design a metric to measure visual clutter in this display; finally we search for an order that minimizes the clutter in a display.","article_number":"1382895","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1382895","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382895/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382895/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-12 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9496,"is_number":30135,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-12 Oct. 2004","start_page":"89","end_page":"96","citing_paper_count":134,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":2015,"insert_date":"20050124","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Displays","Scattering","Computer science","Chromium","User interfaces","Pattern recognition","Gain measurement","Multidimensional systems","Polarization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Multidimensional visualization","dimension order","visual clutter","visual structure"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8779-3","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.2004.64","title":"The InfoVis Toolkit","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8779-3","issn":"1522-404X","rank":40,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"INRIA Futurs/LRI, Université Paris Sud, Orsay, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407972900","id":37407972900,"full_name":"J.-D.

The InfoVis toolkit provides specific data structures to achieve a fast action/feedback loop required by dynamic queries. It comes with a large set of components such as range sliders and tailored control panels required to control and configure the visualizations. These components are integrated into a coherent framework that simplifies the management of rich data structures and the design and extension of visualizations. Supported data structures currently include tables, trees and graphs. Supported visualizations include scatter plots, time series, parallel coordinates, treemaps, icicle trees, node-link diagrams for trees and graphs and adjacency matrices for graphs.

We tackle this problem here with a strategy that computes frequency or density information from the data set, and uses such information in parallel coordinates visualizations to filter out the information to be presented to the user, thus reducing visual clutter and allowing the analyst to observe relevant patterns in the data. The algorithms to construct such visualizations, and the interaction mechanisms supported, inspired by traditional image processing techniques such as grayscale manipulation and thresholding are also presented.

We present MDSteer, a steerable MDS computation engine and visualization tool that progressively computes an MDS layout and handles datasets of over one million points. Our technique employs hierarchical data structures and progressive layouts to allow the user to steer the computation of the algorithm to the interesting areas of the dataset. The algorithm iteratively alternates between a layout stage in which a sub-selection of points are added to the set of active points affected by the MDS iteration, and a binning stage which increases the depth of the bin hierarchy and organizes the currently unplaced points into separate spatial regions. This binning strategy allows the user to select onscreen regions of the layout to focus the MDS computation into the areas of the dataset that are assigned to the selected bins. We show both real and common synthetic benchmark datasets with dimensionalities ranging from 3 to 300 and cardinalities of over one million points.","article_number":"1382891","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1382891","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382891/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382891/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-12 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9496,"is_number":30135,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-12 Oct. 2004","start_page":"57","end_page":"64","citing_paper_count":57,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":517,"insert_date":"20050124","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Multidimensional systems","Costs","Data structures","Iterative algorithms","Psychology","Large-scale systems","Springs","Engines","Data visualization","Chromium"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["dimensionality reduction","multidimensional scaling"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8779-3","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.2004.18","title":"Dynamic Drawing of Clustered Graphs","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8779-3","issn":"1522-404X","rank":48,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Israel","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37646534300","id":37646534300,"full_name":"Y.

Visual and computational identification of these \"clusters\" becomes useful when domain experts desire to determine those factors of major influence in the formation of access and communication clusters or in the detection and contention of disease spread. With the current increases in graphic hardware capabilities and RAM sizes, it is more useful to relate graph sizes to the available screen real estate S and the amount of available RAM M, instead of the number of edges or nodes in the graph. We offer a visual interface that is parameterized by M and S and is particularly suited for navigation tasks that require the identification of subgraphs whose edge density is above certain threshold. This is achieved by providing a zoomable matrix view of the underlying data. This view is strongly coupled to a hierarchical view of the essential information elements present in the data domain.

In response, a wide variety of visualization tools have been created to facilitate data analysis. Biologists often face a dilemma in choosing the best tool for their situation. The tool that works best for one biologist may not work well for another due to differences in the type of insight they seek from their data. A primary purpose of a visualization tool is to provide domain-relevant insight into the data. Ideally, any user wants maximum information in the least possible time. In this paper we identify several distinct characteristics of insight that enable us to recognize and quantify it. Based on this, we empirically evaluate five popular microarray visualization tools.

A rule-based behavior system continuously controls and updates the dynamic actions of individual, three-dimensional elements that represent the changing data values of reoccurring data objects. As a result, different distinguishable motion types emerge that are driven by local interactions between the spatial elements as well as the evolution of time-varying data values. Notably, this representation technique focuses on the representation of dynamic data alteration characteristics, or how reoccurring data objects change over time, instead of depicting the exact data values themselves. In addition, it demonstrates the potential of motion as a useful information visualization cue. The original information flocking approach is extended to incorporate time-varying datasets, live database querying, continuous data streaming, real-time data similarity evaluation, automatic shape generation and more stable flocking algorithms. Different experiments prove that information flocking is capable of representing short-term events as well as long-term temporal data evolutions of both individual and groups of time-dependent data objects. An historical stock market quote price dataset is used to demonstrate the algorithms and principles of time-varying information flocking.","article_number":"1382896","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1382896","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382896/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382896/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-12 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9496,"is_number":30135,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-12 Oct. 2004","start_page":"97","end_page":"104","citing_paper_count":40,"citing_patent_count":11,"download_count":1492,"insert_date":"20050124","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Computational modeling","Time varying systems","Artificial intelligence","Computer simulation","Marine animals","Cognition","Control systems","Visual databases","Shape"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["time-varying information visualization","artificial life","3D information visualization","motion","boids"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8779-3","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.2004.3","title":"A Rank-by-Feature Framework for Unsupervised Multidimensional Data Exploration Using Low Dimensional Projections","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8779-3","issn":"1522-404X","rank":53,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science & Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory, Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087587877","id":37087587877,"full_name":"Jinwook Seo","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory, Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science & Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory, Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283016400","id":37283016400,"full_name":"B.

We implement these principles in a novel conceptual framework called the rank-by-feature framework. In the framework, users can choose a ranking criterion interesting to them and sort 1D or 2D axis-parallel projections according to the criterion. We introduce the rank-by-feature prism that is a color-coded lower-triangular matrix that guides users to desired features. Statistical graphs (histogram, boxplot, and scatterplot) and information visualization techniques (overview, coordination, and dynamic query) are combined to help users effectively traverse 1D and 2D axis-parallel projections, and finally to help them interactively find interesting features.","article_number":"1382892","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1382892","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382892/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382892/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-12 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9496,"is_number":30135,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-12 Oct. 2004","start_page":"65","end_page":"72","citing_paper_count":39,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":775,"insert_date":"20050124","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Multidimensional systems","Data analysis","Data visualization","Data mining","Computer vision","Principal component analysis","Computer science","Laboratories","Educational institutions","Displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["information visualization","exploratory data analysis","dynamic query","feature detection/selection","statistical graphics"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8779-3","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.2004.2","title":"A History Mechanism for Visual Data Mining","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8779-3","issn":"1522-404X","rank":54,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"SD Industries GmbH, Gundelfingen, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37938665500","id":37938665500,"full_name":"M.

Nowadays, different kinds of maps are used to emphasize the spatial distribution of one or more geo-spatial attributes. The nature of geo-spatial statistical data is the highly non-uniform distribution in the real world data sets. This has several impacts on the resulting map visualizations. Classical area maps tend to highlight patterns in large areas, which may, however, be of low importance. Cartographers and geographers used cartograms or value-by-area maps to address this problem long before computers were available. Although many automatic techniques have been developed, most of the value-by-area cartograms are generated manually via human interaction. In this paper, we propose a novel visualization technique for geo-spatial data sets called RecMap. Our technique approximates a rectangular partition of the (rectangular) display area into a number of map regions preserving important geo-spatial constraints. It is a fully automatic technique with explicit user control over all exploration constraints within the exploration process. Experiments show that our technique produces visualizations of geo-spatial data sets, which enhance the discovery of global and local correlations, and demonstrate its performance in a variety of applications.","article_number":"1382888","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1382888","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382888/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382888/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-12 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9496,"is_number":30135,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-12 Oct. 2004","start_page":"33","end_page":"40","citing_paper_count":36,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":527,"insert_date":"20050124","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Shape","Humans","Transaction databases","Data analysis","Information analysis","Topology","Computer displays","Automatic control","Visual databases"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Geographic Visualization","Information Visualization","Database and Data Mining Visualization"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8779-3","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.2004.71","title":"Value and Relation Display for Interactive Exploration of High Dimensional Datasets","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8779-3","issn":"1522-404X","rank":56,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087513015","id":37087513015,"full_name":"Jing Yang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089140012","id":37089140012,"full_name":"A.

By explicitly conveying the relationships among the dimensions of a high dimensional dataset, the VaR display helps users grasp the associations among dimensions. By using pixel-oriented techniques to present values of the data items in a condensed manner, the VaR display reveals data patterns in the dataset using as little screen space as possible. The navigation and selection tools enable users to interactively reduce clutter, navigate within the dimension space, and examine data value details within context effectively and efficiently. The VaR display scales well to datasets with large numbers of data items by employing sampling and texture mapping.

For graphs of up to hundreds of nodes and edges, there are many effective techniques available. At greater scale, data density and occlusion problems often negate its effectiveness. Conventional pan-and-zoom, and multiscale and geometric fisheye views are not fully satisfactory solutions to this problem. As an alternative, we describe a topological zooming method. It is based on the precomputation of a hierarchy of coarsened graphs, which are combined on the fly into renderings with the level of detail dependent on the distance from one or more foci.

However, explicit expansion of nodes can be tedious. Expand-ahead is a space-filling strategy by which some nodes are automatically expanded to fill available screen space, without expanding so far that nodes are shown at a reduced size or outside the viewport. This often allows a user exploring the tree to see further down the tree without the effort required in a traditional browser. It also means the user can sometimes drill-down a path faster, by skipping over levels of the tree that are automatically expanded for them. Expand-ahead differs from many detail-in-context techniques in that there is no scaling or distortion involved. We present 1D and 2D prototype implementations of expand-ahead, and identify various design issues and possible enhancements to our designs. Our prototypes support smooth, animated transitions between different views of a tree. We also present the results of a controlled experiment which show that, under certain conditions, users are able to drill-down faster with expand-ahead than without.","article_number":"1382899","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1382899","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382899/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1382899/","publication_title":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-12 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9496,"is_number":30135,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-12 Oct. 2004","start_page":"119","end_page":"126","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":2,"download_count":131,"insert_date":"20050124","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Navigation","Computer science","Automatic control","Prototypes","Tree graphs","Space exploration","Laboratories","Animation","Chromium","Computer graphics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["tree browsing and navigation","focus+context","expandahead","automatic expansion","space filling","adaptive user interfaces"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8779-3","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.2004.47","title":"Metric-Based Network Exploration and Multiscale Scatterplot","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8779-3","issn":"1522-404X","rank":61,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Université du Quàbec à Chicoutimi, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282997400","id":37282997400,"full_name":"Y.
