These new isosurfaces have the same separating properties as the MC surfaces but they are comprised of quad patches that tend to eliminate the common negative aspect of poorly shaped triangles of the MC isosurfaces. Based upon the concept of this new dual operator, we describe a simple, but rather effective iterative scheme for producing smooth separating surfaces for binary, enumerated volumes which are often produced by segmentation algorithms. Both the dual surface algorithm and the iterative smoothing scheme are easily implemented.","article_number":"1372234","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1372234","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372234/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372234/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization 2004","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-15 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9449,"is_number":29999,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-15 Oct. 2004","start_page":"489","end_page":"496","citing_paper_count":47,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":711,"insert_date":"20050228","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Isosurfaces","Iterative algorithms","Lattices","Smoothing methods","Chromium","Computer graphics","Computational geometry","Solid modeling","USA Councils","Visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Marching Cubes","isosurfaces","triangular mesh","dual graph","segmented data","smoothing"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8788-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.2004.7","title":"Augmented reality with tangible auto-fabricated models for molecular biology applications","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8788-0","rank":2,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Scripps Research Institute, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282625300","id":37282625300,"full_name":"A.

A CVT is a special Voronoi tessellation for which the generators of the Voronoi regions in the tessellation are also the centers of mass (or means) with respect to a prescribed density. A distance function in both the spatial and vector spaces is introduced to measure the similarity of the spatially distributed vector fields. Based on such a distance, vector fields are naturally clustered and their simplified representations are obtained. Our method combines simple geometric intuitions with the rigorously established optimality properties of the CVTs. It is simple to describe, easy to understand and implement.

This allows to perform anisotropic geometrical operations (e.g., scaling the thickness). However, flattening of a curved structure implies a distortion of its surface. The distortion problem is alleviated through a focus-and-context minimization approach. Distortion is smallest close to a focal point which can be interactively selected by the user.","article_number":"1372238","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1372238","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372238/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372238/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization 2004","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-15 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9449,"is_number":29999,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-15 Oct. 2004","start_page":"521","end_page":"527","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":79,"insert_date":"20050228","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Surface reconstruction","Data visualization","Medical diagnostic imaging","Osteoarthritis","Biomedical imaging","Magnetic resonance imaging","Bones","Thickness measurement","Image reconstruction","Inspection"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["visualization in medicine","applications of visualization"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8788-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.2004.72","title":"Non-linear model fitting to parameterize diseased blood vessels","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8788-0","rank":7,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Technology, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089655607","id":37089655607,"full_name":"A.

The objective of this research is to estimate the dimensions of lower extremity arteries, imaged by computed tomography (CT). These parameters are required to get a good quality visualization of healthy as well as diseased arteries using a visualization technique such as curved planar reformation (CPR). The vessel is modeled using an elliptical or cylindrical structure with specific dimensions, orientation and blood vessel mean density. The model separates two homogeneous regions: its inner side represents a region of density for vessels, and its outer side a region for background. Taking into account the point spread function (PSF) of a CT scanner, a function is modeled with a Gaussian kernel, in order to smooth the vessel boundary in the model. A new strategy for vessel parameter estimation is presented. It stems from vessel model and model parameter optimization by a nonlinear optimization procedure, i.e., the Levenberg-Marquardt technique. The method provides center location, diameter and orientation of the vessel as well as blood and background mean density values. The method is tested on synthetic data and real patient data with encouraging results.","article_number":"1372222","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1372222","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372222/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372222/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization 2004","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-15 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9449,"is_number":29999,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-15 Oct. 2004","start_page":"393","end_page":"400","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":131,"insert_date":"20050228","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Blood vessels","Computed tomography","Biomedical imaging","Visualization","Arteries","Diseases","Image edge detection","Atherosclerosis","Attenuation","Parameter estimation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Segmentation","Blood Vessel Detection"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8788-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.2004.10","title":"Building an Ontology of Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8788-0","rank":8,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Computing, University of Leeds, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282576200","id":37282576200,"full_name":"D.J.

We propose a method for denoising 2-D vector fields that are corrupted by additive noise. The method is based on the vector wavelet transform and wavelet coefficient thresholding. We compare our wavelet-based denoising method with Gaussian filtering, and test the effect of these methods on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the vector fields before and after denoising. We also study the effect on relevant details for visualization, such as vortex measures. The results show that for low SNR, Gaussian filtering with large kernels has a somewhat higher performance than the wavelet-based method in terms of SNR. For larger SNR, the wavelet-based method outperforms Gaussian filtering. This is mostly due to the fact that Gaussian filtering tends to remove small details, which are preserved by the wavelet-based method.","article_number":"1372274","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1372274","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372274/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372274/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization 2004","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-15 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9449,"is_number":29999,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-15 Oct. 2004","start_page":"25p","end_page":"25p","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":80,"insert_date":"20050228","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Noise reduction","Filtering","Visualization","Signal to noise ratio","Feature extraction","Additive noise","Wavelet transforms","Wavelet coefficients","Testing","Kernel"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["denoising","flow visualization","wavelets"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8788-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.2004.12","title":"Self-illustrating phenomena","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8788-0","rank":17,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Stanford University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349803800","id":37349803800,"full_name":"P.

However in visualization systems, this link between features in the data and the meaning of those features is often missing or implicit. It is assumed that the user, through looking at the output, will close the loop between representation and insight. An alternative is to view visualization tools as interfaces between data and insight, and to enrich this interface with capabilities linked to users’ conceptual models of the data. Preliminary work has been carried out to develop such an interface as a modular component that can be installed in a pipelined architecture.

The underlying approach is to maximize the use of current graphics hardware by using 3D texture mapping. This approach commonly suffers from an expensive voxelization of each time-step as well as from large size of the voxel array approximating each step. Hence, in our scheme, instead of explicitly voxelizing each scalar field, we directly store each time-step as a three dimensional texture in its native form. We create the function that warps a voxel grid into the given structured grid. At rendering time, we reconstruct the function at each pixel using hardware-based trilinear interpolation. The resulting coordinates allow us to compute the scalar value at this pixel using a second texture lookup. For fixed grids, the function remains constant across time-steps and only the scalar field table needs to be re-loaded as a texture. Our new approach achieves excellent performance with relatively low texture memory requirements and low approximation error.","article_number":"1372266","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1372266","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372266/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372266/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization 2004","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-15 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9449,"is_number":29999,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-15 Oct. 2004","start_page":"17p","end_page":"17p","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":61,"insert_date":"20050228","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Grid computing","Extrapolation","Mesh generation","Interpolation","Lattices","Data visualization","Approximation algorithms","Sampling methods","Error analysis","Root mean square"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8788-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.2004.127","title":"Volume refinement fairing isosurfaces","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8788-0","rank":29,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Technical University of Kaiserslautern, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282067000","id":37282067000,"full_name":"M.

The task for interactively visualizing such a massive terrain is to render a triangulated mesh using a view-dependent error tolerance, thus intelligently and perceptually managing the scene’s geometric complexity. At any particular instance in time (i.e. displayed frame), this level-of-detail (LOD) terrain surface consists of a mesh composed of hundreds of thousands of dynamically selected triangles. The triangles are selected using the current time-step’s view parameters and the view-dependent error tolerance. Massive terrain data easily exceeds main memory storage capacity such that out-of-core rendering must be performed. This further complicates the triangle selection and terrain rendering owing to tertiary storage’s relatively poor performance.","article_number":"1372261","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1372261","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372261/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372261/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization 2004","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-15 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9449,"is_number":29999,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-15 Oct. 2004","start_page":"12p","end_page":"12p","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":46,"insert_date":"20050228","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Costs","Computational intelligence","Sorting","Data structures","Testing","Performance evaluation","Spatial resolution"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8788-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.2004.53","title":"Interactive Poster: Grid-Enabled Collaborative Scientific Visualization Environment","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8788-0","rank":34,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Northern Arizona University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088238863","id":37088238863,"full_name":"E.C.

The human visual system is the result of evolution by natural selection and hence its design must incorporate detailed knowledge of the physical properties of the natural environment.

Although it is well known that CHD mainly occurs due to blocked arteries, there are contradictory results from studies designed to identify basic causes for this common disease is. To find out more about the true reason for CHD, virtual models can be employed to better understand the way the heart functions. With such a model, scientists and surgeons are able to analyze the effects of different treatment options, and ultimately find more suited ways to prevent coronary heart diseases. To investigate a given model, appropriate navigation methods are required, including suitable input devices. For the visualization, graphics cards originally designed for gaming applications are used; so, it is a just natural transition to adapt gaming input devices to a visualization system for controlling of the navigation. These devices are usually well designed with respect to ergonomics and durability, yielding more degrees of freedom in steering than two-dimensional input devices, such as desktop mice. This poster describes a visualization system that provides the user with advanced control devices for navigation enabling interactive exploration of the model. Force-feedback and sound effects provide additional cues.","article_number":"1372281","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1372281","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372281/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372281/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization 2004","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-15 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9449,"is_number":29999,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-15 Oct. 2004","start_page":"32p","end_page":"32p","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":68,"insert_date":"20050228","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Navigation","Visualization","Cardiac disease","Arteries","Cardiovascular diseases","Heart","Surgery","Graphics","Control systems","Ergonomics"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8788-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.2004.11","title":"Capillary Histology Imagery Visualization and Exploration","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8788-0","rank":39,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282585700","id":37282585700,"full_name":"M.

Our technique is a generalization of cut-away views, which - depending on the viewpoint - remove or suppress less important parts of a scene to reveal more important underlying information. We automatize and apply this idea to volumetric data. Each part of the volumetric data is assigned an object importance, which encodes visibility priority. This property determines which structures should be readily discernible and which structures are less important. In those image regions, where an object occludes more important structures it is displayed more sparsely than in those areas where no occlusion occurs. Thus the objects of interest are clearly visible. For each object several representations, i.e., levels of sparseness, are specified. The display of an individual object may incorporate different levels of sparseness. The goal is to emphasize important structures and to maximize the information content in the final image. This work also discusses several possible schemes for level of sparseness specification and different ways how object importance can be composited to determine the final appearance of a particular object.","article_number":"1372190","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1372190","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372190/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372190/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization 2004","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-15 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9449,"is_number":29999,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-15 Oct. 2004","start_page":"139","end_page":"145","citing_paper_count":67,"citing_patent_count":2,"download_count":476,"insert_date":"20050228","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Liver neoplasms","Computer graphics","Focusing","Lesions","Image generation","Data visualization","Medical services","Biomedical equipment","Shape"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8788-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.2004.75","title":"Optimal global conformal surface parameterization","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8788-0","rank":47,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, SUNY at Stony Brook, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279448300","id":37279448300,"full_name":"M.

Riemann surface structure is a fundamental structure and governs many natural physical phenomena, such as heat diffusion and electro-magnetic fields on the surface. A good parameterization is crucial for simulation and visualization. This paper provides an explicit method for finding optimal global conformal parameterizations of arbitrary surfaces. It relies on certain holomorphic differential forms and conformal mappings from differential geometry and Riemann surface theories. Algorithms are developed to modify topology, locate zero points, and determine cohomology types of differential forms. The implementation is based on a finite dimensional optimization method. The optimal parameterization is intrinsic to the geometry, preserves angular structure, and can play an important role in various applications including texture mapping, remeshing, morphing and simulation. The method is demonstrated by visualizing the Riemann surface structure of real surfaces represented as triangle meshes.","article_number":"1372206","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1372206","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372206/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372206/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization 2004","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-15 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9449,"is_number":29999,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-15 Oct. 2004","start_page":"267","end_page":"274","citing_paper_count":52,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":446,"insert_date":"20050228","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Surface texture","Visualization","Optimization methods","Surface structures","Solid modeling","Computer science","Topology","Computational geometry","Conformal mapping","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Computational geometry and object modeling","Curve","surface","solid","and object representations","Surface parameterization"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8788-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.2004.107","title":"Tracking of vector field singularities in unstructured 3D time-dependent datasets","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8788-0","rank":48,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of Kaiserslautern, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282573700","id":37282573700,"full_name":"C.

The concept of singularity index is discussed and extended from the well-understood planar case to the more intricate three-dimensional setting. Assuming a tetrahedral grid with linear interpolation in space and time, vector field singularities obey rules imposed by fundamental invariants (Poincare index), which we use as a basis for an efficient tracking algorithm.

Our system allows spectators to visualize global features such as large-scale behaviors and team strategies, as opposed to the limited, local view that traditional spectating modes provide. We also add overlay visualizations of semantic information related to the action that might be important to a spectator in order to reduce the information overload that plagues traditional overview visualizations. These overlays can visualize information about abstract concepts such as player distribution over time and areas of intense combat activity, and also highlight important features like player paths, fire coverage, etc. This added information allows spectators to identify important game events more easily and reveals large-scale player behaviors that might otherwise be overlooked.","article_number":"1372193","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1372193","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372193/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372193/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization 2004","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-15 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9449,"is_number":29999,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-15 Oct. 2004","start_page":"163","end_page":"170","citing_paper_count":42,"citing_patent_count":4,"download_count":330,"insert_date":"20050228","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Games","Large-scale systems","Computational modeling","Cameras","Data mining","Displays","Bridges","Virtual environment","Pattern analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Games","Spectating"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8788-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.2004.112","title":"Visualization in grid computing environments","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8788-0","rank":50,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Computing, University of Leeds, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271754900","id":37271754900,"full_name":"K.

In this research, we evolve the dataflow concept to allow parts of the visualization process to be executed remotely in a secure and seamless manner.

We develop an XML application capable of describing visualization at the three levels. To complement this, we have implemented an extension to a popular visualization system, IRIS Explorer, which allows modules in a dataflow pipeline to run on a set of grid resources. For computational steering applications, we have developed a library that allows a visualization system front-end to connect to a simulation running remotely on a grid resource.

The technique uses a lighting transfer function that takes into account the distribution of values along a material boundary and features a novel interface for visualizing and specifying these transfer functions.

However, constructing effective multiperspective images is something of an art. We describe an interactive system for creating multiperspective images composed of serially blended cross-slits images. Beginning with a sideways-looking video of the scene as might be captured from a moving vehicle, we allow the user to interactively specify a set of cross-slits cameras, possibly with gaps between them. In each camera, one of the slits is defined to be the camera path, which is typically horizontal, and the user is left to choose the second slit, which is typically vertical. The system then generates intermediate views between these cameras using a novel interpolation scheme, thereby producing a multiperspective image with no seams. The user can also choose the picture surface in space onto which viewing rays are projected, thereby establishing a parameterization for the image. We show how the choice of this surface can be used to create interesting visual effects. We demonstrate our system by constructing multiperspective images that summarize city blocks, including corners, blocks with deep plazas and other challenging urban situations.","article_number":"1372240","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1372240","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372240/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372240/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization 2004","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-15 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9449,"is_number":29999,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-15 Oct. 2004","start_page":"537","end_page":"544","citing_paper_count":37,"citing_patent_count":7,"download_count":240,"insert_date":"20050228","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Cameras","Computer graphics","Cities and towns","Image generation","Layout","Fabrics","Art","Application software","Optical distortion"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["cross-slits image","multi-perspective image","city block"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8788-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.2004.101","title":"Surface reconstruction of noisy and defective data sets","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8788-0","rank":53,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, State University of New York at Stony Brook, NY","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37554814900","id":37554814900,"full_name":"H.

The inside/outside orientation of each group is determined through a robust voting algorithm. We locally fit an implicit quadric surface in each octree cell. The locally fitted implicit surfaces are then blended to produce a signed distance field using the modified Shepard's method.

While features in 2D tensors can be identified as either wedge or trisector points, in 3D, the corresponding stable features are lines, not just points. These topological feature lines provide a compact representation of the 3D tensor field and are essential in helping scientists and engineers understand their complex nature.

Because of the inherent intricacy of these features, standard flow visualization techniques typically yield cluttered depictions. The paper addresses the challenges raised by the visual exploration and validation of two CFD simulations involving vortex breakdown. To permit accurate and insightful visualization we propose a new approach that unfolds the geometry of the breakdown region by letting a plane travel through the structure along a curve. We track the continuous evolution of the associated projected vector field using the theoretical framework of parametric topology. To improve the understanding of the spatial relationship between the resulting curves and lines we use direct volume rendering and multidimensional transfer functions for the display of flow-derived scalar quantities. This enriches the visualization and provides an intuitive context for the extracted topological information. Our results offer clear, synthetic depictions that permit new insight into the structural properties of vortex breakdowns.","article_number":"1372196","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1372196","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372196/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372196/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization 2004","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-15 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9449,"is_number":29999,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-15 Oct. 2004","start_page":"187","end_page":"194","citing_paper_count":31,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":324,"insert_date":"20050228","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Electric breakdown","Aircraft","Computational fluid dynamics","Geometry","Topology","Multidimensional systems","Transfer functions","Displays","Data mining"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["flow visualization","vortex analysis","parametric topology","cutting planes","volume rendering"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8788-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.2004.88","title":"Real-time motion estimation and visualization on graphics cards","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8788-0","rank":58,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Caesar Research Center, Bonn, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282542600","id":37282542600,"full_name":"R.

The motion is estimated through an eigenvector analysis of the spatio-temporal structure tensor at every pixel location. This approach is computationally demanding but allows reliable velocity estimates as well as quality indicators for the obtained results. We use a 2D color map and a region of interest selector for the visualization of the velocities. On the selected velocities we apply a hierarchical smoothing scheme which allows the choice of the desired scale of the motion field. We demonstrate several examples of test sequences in which some persons are moving with different velocities than others. These persons are visually marked in the real-time display of the image sequence. The tool is also applied to angiography sequences to emphasize the blood flow and its distribution. An efficient processing of the data streams is achieved by mapping the operations onto the stream architecture of standard graphics cards. The card receives the images and performs both the motion estimation and visualization, taking advantage of the parallelism in the graphics processor and the superior memory bandwidth. The integration of data processing and visualization also saves on unnecessary data transfers and thus allows the real-time analysis of 320/spl times/240 images. We expect that on the newest generation of graphics hardware our tool could run in real time for the standard VGA format.","article_number":"1372241","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1372241","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372241/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372241/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization 2004","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-15 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9449,"is_number":29999,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-15 Oct. 2004","start_page":"545","end_page":"552","citing_paper_count":29,"citing_patent_count":6,"download_count":210,"insert_date":"20050228","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Motion estimation","Graphics","Image sequences","Streaming media","Data visualization","Motion analysis","Image motion analysis","Tensile stress","Smoothing methods","Testing"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["motion estimation","motion visualization","structure tensor","eigenvector analysis","real-time processing","graphics hardware"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8788-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.2004.37","title":"Haptic display of interaction between textured models","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8788-0","rank":59,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282557800","id":37282557800,"full_name":"M.A. Otaduy","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089139658","id":37089139658,"full_name":"N.

As a contribution to stream line oriented topology we introduce new methods to detect global bifurcations like saddle connections and cyclic fold bifurcations.

The proposed techniques combine direct volume rendering (DVR) and curved planar reformation (CPR) within a single image. The VesselGlyph consists of several regions where different rendering methods are used. The region type, the used visualization method and the region parameters depend on the distance from the vessel centerline and on viewing parameters as well. By selecting proper rendering techniques for different regions, vessels are depicted in a naturally looking and undistorted anatomic context. This may facilitate the diagnosis and treatment planning of patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease.

We describe how the particle computation can be performed using a PC cluster, how the algorithm can be adapted to work with a multiblock curvilinear mesh, how scalars can be extracted and used to color the particles, and how the out-of-core visualization can be scaled to 293 billion particles while still achieving interactive performance on PC hardware. Compared to the earlier work, our data set size and total number of particles are an order of magnitude larger. We also describe a new compression technique that losslessly reduces the amount of particle storage by 41% and speeds the particle retrieval by about 20%.","article_number":"1372217","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1372217","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372217/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372217/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization 2004","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-15 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9449,"is_number":29999,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-15 Oct. 2004","start_page":"353","end_page":"360","citing_paper_count":22,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":163,"insert_date":"20050228","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Computational fluid dynamics","NASA","Geometry","Hardware","Electronic mail","Technology management","Space technology","Clustering algorithms","Data mining"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["visualization","particle tracing","large data","out-of-core","PC hardware","clusters","computational fluid dynamics"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8788-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.2004.62","title":"Light Collages: lighting design for effective visualization","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8788-0","rank":66,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and UMIACS, University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087680927","id":37087680927,"full_name":"C.H.

By incorporating a biochemically sensitive level-of-detail hierarchy into our molecular representation, we communicate appropriate volume occupancy and shape while dramatically reducing the visual clutter that normally inhibits higher-level spatial comprehension. Our hierarchical, image based rendering also allows dynamically computed physical properties data (e.g. electrostatics potential) to be mapped onto the molecular surface, tying molecular structure to molecular function. Finally, we present another approach to interactive molecular exploration using volumetric and structural rendering in tandem to discover molecular properties that neither rendering mode alone could reveal.

With GPU-based volume rendering driving a nonlinear optimization, we estimate the nebula's local emission density as a function of its radial and axial coordinates, and we recover the orientation of the nebula relative to Earth. The optimization refines the nebula model and its orientation by minimizing the differences between the rendered image and the original astronomical image. The resulting model enables realistic 3D visualizations of planetary nebulae, e.g. for educational purposes in planetarium shows.

In this paper we introduce the use of a reaction-diffusion model, already well known for its ability to form irregular spatio-temporal patters, to control the size, density, and placement of the vector field representation. We demonstrate that it is possible to encode vector field information (orientation and magnitude) into the parameters governing a reaction-diffusion model to form a spot pattern with the correct orientation, size, and density, creating an effective visualization. To encode direction we texture the spots using a light to dark fading texture. We also show that it is possible to use the reaction-diffusion model to visualize an additional scalar value, such as the uncertainty in the orientation of the vector field. An additional benefit of the reaction-diffusion visualization technique arises from its automatic density distribution. This benefit suggests using the technique to augment other vector visualization techniques. We demonstrate this utility by augmenting a LIC visualization with a reaction-diffusion visualization. Finally, the reaction-diffusion visualization method provides a technique that can be used for streamline and glyph placement.","article_number":"1372187","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1372187","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372187/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372187/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization 2004","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-15 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9449,"is_number":29999,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-15 Oct. 2004","start_page":"115","end_page":"122","citing_paper_count":18,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":240,"insert_date":"20050228","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Displays","Visualization","Uncertainty","Size control","Scientific computing","Shape control","Fading","Computer applications","Fluid dynamics","Bioelectric phenomena"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Vector Field Visualization","Flow Visualization","Reaction-Diffusion","Vector Fields"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8788-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.2004.128","title":"Vorticity based flow analysis and visualization for Pelton turbine design optimization","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8788-0","rank":74,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"ETH Zürich, Switzerland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282541900","id":37282541900,"full_name":"F.

It is present not only in vortices but also in shear flow. Especially in ducted flows, most of the overall vorticity is usually contained in the boundary layer. When a vortex develops from the boundary layer, this can be described by transport of vorticity. For a better understanding of a flow it is therefore of interest to examine vorticity in all of its different roles. The goal of this application study was not primarily the visualization of vortices but of vorticity distribution and its role in vortex phenomena. The underlying industrial case is a design optimization for a Pelton turbine. An important industrial objective is to improve the quality of the water jets driving the runner. Jet quality is affected mostly by vortices originating in the distributor ring. For a better understanding of this interrelation, it is crucial to not only visualize these vortices but also to analyze the mechanisms of their creation. We used various techniques for the visualization of vorticity, including field lines and modified isosurfaces. For field line based visualization, we extended the image-guided streamline placement algorithm of Turk and Banks to data-guided field line placement on three-dimensional unstructured grids.","article_number":"1372195","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1372195","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372195/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372195/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization 2004","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-15 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9449,"is_number":29999,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-15 Oct. 2004","start_page":"179","end_page":"186","citing_paper_count":18,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":485,"insert_date":"20050228","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Design optimization","Hydraulic turbines","Shape","Application software","Isosurfaces","Streaming media","Chromium","Computer graphics","Image processing"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["flow visualization","feature extraction","line placement"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8788-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.2004.5","title":"Anisotropic volume rendering for extremely dense, thin line data","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8788-0","rank":75,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283639900","id":37283639900,"full_name":"G.

Further, very dense or intertwined lines, rendered with traditional visualization techniques, can produce unintelligible results with unclear depth relationships between the lines and no sense of global structure. Our approach is to apply a lighting model to the lines and sample them into an anisotropic voxel representation based on spherical harmonics as a preprocessing step. Then we evaluate and render these voxels for a given view using traditional volume rendering. For extremely large line based datasets, conversion to anisotropic voxels reduces the overall storage and rendering for O(n) lines to O(1) with a large constant that is still small enough to allow meaningful visualization of the entire dataset at nearly interactive rates on a single commodity PC.","article_number":"1372186","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1372186","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372186/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372186/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization 2004","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-15 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9449,"is_number":29999,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-15 Oct. 2004","start_page":"107","end_page":"114","citing_paper_count":17,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":224,"insert_date":"20050228","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Data visualization","Computer graphics","Surface reconstruction","Linear accelerators","Vectors","Fluid flow","Image storage","Rendering (computer graphics)","Magnetic fields"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["anisotropic lighting","line data","scientific visualization","vector field","volume rendering"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8788-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.2004.52","title":"Interactive point-based isosurface extraction","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8788-0","rank":76,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282553200","id":37282553200,"full_name":"Y.

Combining DTI data with the computational methods of MR tractography, neuroscientists can estimate the locations and sizes of nerve bundles (white matter pathways) that course through the human brain. Neuroscientists have used visualization techniques to better understand tractography data, but they often struggle with the abundance and complexity of the pathways. We describe a novel set of interaction techniques that make it easier to explore and interpret such pathways. Specifically, our application allows neuroscientists to place and interactively manipulate box-shaped regions (or volumes of interest) to selectively display pathways that pass through specific anatomical areas. A simple and flexible query language allows for arbitrary combinations of these queries using Boolean logic operators. Queries can be further restricted by numerical path properties such as length, mean fractional anisotropy, and mean curvature. By precomputing the pathways and their statistical properties, we obtain the speed necessary for interactive question-and-answer sessions with brain researchers. We survey some questions that researchers have been asking about tractography data and show how our system can be used to answer these questions efficiently.","article_number":"1372220","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1372220","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372220/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372220/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization 2004","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-15 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9449,"is_number":29999,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-15 Oct. 2004","start_page":"377","end_page":"384","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":112,"insert_date":"20050228","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Diffusion tensor imaging","Data visualization","Nerve fibers","Magnetic resonance imaging","Humans","Neurons","Computer graphics","Algorithm design and analysis","Corona","Neural pathways"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","DTI","MR Tractography"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8788-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.2004.98","title":"STEPS - an application for simulation of transsphenoidal endonasal pituitary surgery","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8788-0","rank":79,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Research Center, VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088064606","id":37088064606,"full_name":"A.

The system is broadly applicable and currently used by medical scientists conducting an osteoporosis research project. Human vertebral bodies are scanned using a high resolution microCT scanner producing scans of roughly 8 GB size each. All participating research groups require access to the centrally stored data. Due to the rich internal bone structure, scientists need to interactively explore the full dataset at coarse levels, as well as visualize subvolumes of interest at the highest resolution. Our solution is based on HDF5 and GridFTP. When accessing data remotely, the HDF5 data processing pipeline is modified to support efficient retrieval of subvolumes. We reduce the overall latency and optimize throughput by executing high-level operations on the remote side. The GridFTP protocol is used to pass the HDF5 requests to a customized server. The approach takes full advantage of local graphics hardware for rendering.

Essentially, we find that the methods of defect (feature) detection are at least as robust as those based on the exploration of electron density for Si systems.","article_number":"1372231","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1372231","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372231/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372231/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization 2004","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-15 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9449,"is_number":29999,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-15 Oct. 2004","start_page":"465","end_page":"472","citing_paper_count":12,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":149,"insert_date":"20050228","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Data analysis","Data engineering","Lattices","Computer science","Electrons","Silicon","Fluid dynamics","Computational modeling","Physics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Feature Extraction","Scientific Data Visualization","Data Mining","Iso-surface","Transfer Functions","Molecular Dynamics"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8788-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.2004.4","title":"Adaptive 4-8 texture hierarchies","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8788-0","rank":82,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087181431","id":37087181431,"full_name":"L.M.

A novel texture hierarchy is introduced based on 4-8 refinements of raster tiles, in which the texture grids in effect rotate 45 degrees for each level of refinement. This hierarchy provides twice as many levels of detail as conventional quadtree-style refinement schemes such as mipmaps, and thus provides per-pixel view-dependent filtering that is twice as close to the ideal cutoff frequency for an average pixel. Because of this more gradual change in low-pass filtering, and due to the more precise emulation of the ideal cutoff frequency, we find in practice that the transitions between texture levels of detail are not perceptible. This allows rendering systems to avoid the complexity and performance costs of per-pixel blending between texture levels of detail. The 4-8 texturing scheme is integrated into a variant of the real-time optimally adapting meshes (ROAM) algorithm for view-dependent multiresolution mesh generation. Improvements to ROAM included here are: the diamond data structure as a streamlined replacement for the triangle bintree elements, the use of low-pass-filtered geometry patches in place of individual triangles, integration of 4-8 textures, and a simple out-of-core data access mechanism for texture and geometry tiles.","article_number":"1372200","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1372200","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372200/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372200/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization 2004","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-15 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9449,"is_number":29999,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-15 Oct. 2004","start_page":"219","end_page":"226","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":123,"insert_date":"20050228","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Tiles","Low pass filters","Filtering","Cutoff frequency","Geometry","Surface texture","Emulation","Costs","Mesh generation","Data structures"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Large Data Set Visualization","Level-of-Detail Techniques","View-Dependent Visualization","Adaptive Textures","Out-of-Core Algorithms"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8788-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.2004.73","title":"On the role of color in the perception of motion in animated visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8788-0","rank":83,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Institute of Visualization and Interactive Systems, University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268045000","id":37268045000,"full_name":"D.

It occurs whenever images or volumes are magnified, rotated, translated, or warped. Resampling is also an integral procedure in the registration of multimodal datasets, such as CT, PET, and MRI, in the correction of motion artifacts in MRI, and in the alignment of temporal volume sequences in fMRI. It is well known that the quality of the resampling result depends heavily on the quality of the interpolation filter used. However, high-quality filters are rarely employed in practice due to their large spatial extents. We explore a new resampling technique that operates in the frequency-domain where high-quality filtering is feasible. Further, unlike previous methods of this kind, our technique is not limited to integer-ratio scaling factors, but can resample image and volume datasets at any rate. This would usually require the application of slow discrete Fourier transforms (DFT) to return the data to the spatial domain. We studied two methods that successfully avoid these delays: the chirp-z transform and the FFTW package. We also outline techniques to avoid the ringing artifacts that may occur with frequency-domain filtering. Thus, our method can achieve high-quality interpolation at speeds that are usually associated with spatial filters of far lower quality.","article_number":"1372173","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1372173","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372173/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372173/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization 2004","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-15 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9449,"is_number":29999,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-15 Oct. 2004","start_page":"3","end_page":"10","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":4,"download_count":551,"insert_date":"20050228","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Frequency domain analysis","Magnetic resonance imaging","Interpolation","Filters","Filtering","Discrete Fourier transforms","Visualization","Biomedical imaging","Computed tomography","Positron emission tomography"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["resampling","filters","Fourier Transform"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8788-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.2004.24","title":"Dispersion simulation and visualization for urban security","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8788-0","rank":89,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Center for Visual Computing and Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087328122","id":37087328122,"full_name":"Feng Qiu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Center for Visual Computing and Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Center for Visual Computing and Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087910725","id":37087910725,"full_name":"Ye Zhao","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Center for Visual Computing and Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Center for Visual Computing and Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087780775","id":37087780775,"full_name":"Zhe Fan","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Center for Visual Computing and Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Center for Visual Computing and Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087304504","id":37087304504,"full_name":"Xiaoming Wei","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Center for Visual Computing and Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Center for Visual Computing and Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088324759","id":37088324759,"full_name":"H.

Being an image-space technique, it is independent of the complexity of the data being rendered. It can be used to accelerate both time-coherent and noncoherent animation sequences.","article_number":"1372175","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1372175","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372175/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372175/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization 2004","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-15 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9449,"is_number":29999,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-15 Oct. 2004","start_page":"19","end_page":"26","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":110,"insert_date":"20050228","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Acceleration","Data structures","Casting","Rendering (computer graphics)","Transfer functions","Computer graphics","Image generation","Coherence","Runtime","Computer science"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Direct Volume Rendering","Space Leaping","Empty Space Skipping","Ray Coherence","Volume Rendering Acceleration"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8788-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.2004.3","title":"A graphics hardware-based vortex detection and visualization system","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8788-0","rank":91,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Institute of Visualization and Interactive Systems, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267809900","id":37267809900,"full_name":"S.

The result of this simulation method is a simplicial tessellation of spacetime with per-element polynomial solutions for physical quantities such as strain, stress, and velocity. To provide accurate visualizations of the resulting solutions, we have developed a method for per-pixel evaluation of solution data on the GPU. We demonstrate the importance of per-pixel rendering versus simple linear interpolation for producing high quality visualizations.

Second, we ensure the triangulation is homeomorphic to the original surface. Third, we improve the efficiency of constructing the restricted Delaunay triangulation (RDT) of smooth surfaces. We achieve this by constructing the RDT using the advancing front method without computing the Delaunay tetrahedrization of the sample points on the surfaces. The difficulty of handling the front collision problem is tackled by employing the Morse theory. In particular, we construct the Morse-Smale complex to simplify the topological changes of the front.

The geometry is updated interactively and then rendered using an unstructured volume rendering technique. Unless a detailed refinement of the flow volume is specified for the interior, information inside the underlying flow volume is lost in the linear interpolation. These disadvantages can be avoided and/or alleviated using an implicit flow model. An implicit flow is a scalar field constructed such that any point in the field is associated with a termination surface using an advection operator on the flow. We present two techniques, a slice-based three-dimensional texture mapping and an interval volume segmentation coupled with a tetrahedron projection-based renderer, to render implicit stream flows. In the first method, the implicit flow representation is loaded as a 3D texture and manipulated using a dynamic texture operation that allows the flow to be investigated interactively. In our second method, a geometric flow volume is extracted from the implicit flow using a high dimensional isocontouring or interval volume routine. This provides a very detailed flow volume or set of flow volumes that can easily change topology, while retaining accurate characteristics within the flow volume. The advantages and disadvantages of these two techniques are compared with traditional explicit flow volumes.","article_number":"1372185","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1372185","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372185/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372185/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization 2004","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-15 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9449,"is_number":29999,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-15 Oct. 2004","start_page":"99","end_page":"106","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":162,"insert_date":"20050228","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Rendering (computer graphics)","Computer graphics","Surface texture","Geometry","Aerodynamics","Computer science","Vectors","Interpolation","Manipulator dynamics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["interval volume rendering","implicit stream flow","flow visualization","graphics hardware"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8788-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.2004.102","title":"TetSplat: real-time rendering and volume clipping of large unstructured tetrahedral meshes","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8788-0","rank":97,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Linköping Institute of Technology, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284192900","id":37284192900,"full_name":"K.

Our point-based rendering algorithm, which is inspired by QSplat, employs a simple but highly efficient splatting technique that guarantees interactive frame-rates regardless of the size of the input mesh and the available rendering hardware. It furthermore allows for real-time probing of the volumetric data-set through constructive solid geometry operations as well as interactive editing of color transfer functions for an arbitrary number of field values.

Part of this process is the simulation of structural and functional properties, which is in many cases based on finite element analysis (FEA). One prominent example from the automotive industry is the safety improvement resulting from crash worthiness simulations. A simulation model for this purpose usually consists of up to one million finite elements and is assembled from many parts, which are individually meshed out of their CAD representation. In order to accelerate the development cycle, simulation engineers want to be able to modify their FE models without going back to the CAD department. Furthermore, valid CAD models might even not be available in preliminary design stages. However, in contrast to CAD, there is a lack of tools that offer the possibility of modification and processing of finite element components while maintaining the properties relevant to the simulation. In this application paper we present interactive algorithms for intuitive and fast editing of FE models and appropriate visualization techniques to support engineers in understating these models. This includes new kinds of manipulators, feedback mechanisms and facilities for virtual reality and immersion at the workplace, e.g. autostereoscopic displays and haptic devices.","article_number":"1372218","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1372218","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372218/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372218/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization 2004","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-15 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9449,"is_number":29999,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-15 Oct. 2004","start_page":"361","end_page":"368","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":111,"insert_date":"20050228","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Finite element methods","Design automation","Automotive engineering","Virtual prototyping","Product development","Analytical models","Safety","Vehicle crash testing","Assembly","Acceleration"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["finite element modeling","interaction","manipulators","autostereoscopy"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8788-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.2004.106","title":"Topology visualization of the optical power flow through a novel C-shaped nano-aperture","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8788-0","rank":100,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Dept. of Phys., Stanford Univ., CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088265406","id":37088265406,"full_name":"L.

The global view of the vector field structure is deduced by locating singularities (critical points) within the field and augmenting these points with nearby streamlines. We have used for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, three-dimensional topology to analyze the topological differences between a resonant C-shaped nano-aperture and various nonresonant conventional apertures. The topological differences between these apertures are related to the superiority in power throughput of the C-aperture versus conventional round and square sub-wavelength apertures. We demonstrate how topological visualization techniques provide significant insight into the energy enhancement mechanism of the C aperture, and also shed light on critical issues related to the interaction between multiple apertures located in close proximity to each other, which gives rise to cross-talk, for example as a function of distance. Topological techniques allow us to develop design rules for the geometry of these apertures and their desired spot sizes and brightness. The performance of various sub-wavelength apertures can also be compared quantitatively based on their topology. Since topological methods are generically applicable to tensor and vector fields, our approach can be readily extended to provide insight into the broader category of finite-difference-time-domain nano-photonics and nano-science problems.","article_number":"1372215","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1372215","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372215/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372215/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization 2004","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-15 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9449,"is_number":29999,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-15 Oct. 2004","start_page":"337","end_page":"344","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":6,"download_count":129,"insert_date":"20050228","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Topology","Visualization","Load flow","Apertures","Optical crosstalk","Resonance","Throughput","Geometry","Brightness","Tensile stress"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["energy flow topology","Finite-Difference-Time-Domain (fdtd)","C-aperture","vector field visualization"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8788-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.2004.35","title":"Generating sub-resolution detail in images and volumes using constrained texture synthesis","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8788-0","rank":101,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Center for Visual Computing, Computer Science, Stony Brook University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088027547","id":37088027547,"full_name":"Lujin Wang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Center for Visual Computing, Computer Science, Stony Brook University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Center for Visual Computing, Computer Science, Stony Brook University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273119700","id":37273119700,"full_name":"K.

Yet traditional visibility culling algorithms were mainly designed for static data, without consideration of such potential temporal coherency. We explore the use of temporal occlusion coherence (TOC) to accelerate visibility culling for time-varying volume rendering. In our algorithm, the opacity of volume blocks is encoded by means of plenoptic opacity functions (POFs). A coherence-based block fusion technique is employed to coalesce time-coherent data blocks over a span of time steps into a single, representative block. Then POFs need only be computed for these representative blocks. To quickly determine the subvolumes that do not require updates in their visibility status for each subsequent time step, a hierarchical \"TOC tree\" data structure is constructed to store the spans of coherent time steps. To achieve maximal culling potential, while remaining conservative, we have extended our previous POP into an optimized POP (OPOP) encoding scheme for this specific scenario. To test our general TOC and OPOF approach, we have designed a parallel time-varying volume rendering algorithm accelerated by visibility culling. Results from experimental runs on a 32-processor cluster confirm both the effectiveness and scalability of our approach.","article_number":"1372191","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1372191","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372191/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372191/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization 2004","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-15 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9449,"is_number":29999,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-15 Oct. 2004","start_page":"147","end_page":"154","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":3,"download_count":120,"insert_date":"20050228","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Computational modeling","Computer graphics","Algorithm design and analysis","Acceleration","Rendering (computer graphics)","Clustering algorithms","Large-scale systems","Laboratories","Iterative algorithms"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["visibility culling","time-varying data visualization","volume rendering","plenoptic opacity function","large data visualization"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8788-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.2004.69","title":"LoD volume rendering of FEA data","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8788-0","rank":106,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, Taiwan","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087492746","id":37087492746,"full_name":"Shyh-Kuang Ueng","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, Taiwan"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, Taiwan","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088244010","id":37088244010,"full_name":"Yan-Jen Su","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, Taiwan"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, Taiwan","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088248150","id":37088248150,"full_name":"Chi-Tang Chang","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, Taiwan"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"A new multiple resolution volume rendering method for finite element analysis (FEA) data is presented. Our method is composed of three stages: in the first stage, the Gauss points of the FEA cells are calculated. The function values, gradients, diffusions, and influence scopes of the Gauss points are computed. By representing the Gauss points as graph vertices and connecting adjacent Gauss points with edges, an adjacency graph is created. The adjacency graph is used to represent the FEA data in the subsequent computation. In the second stage, a hierarchical structure is established upon the adjacency graph. Any two neighboring vertices with similar function values are merged into a new vertex. The similarity is measured by using a user-defined threshold. Consequently, a new adjacency graph is constructed. Then the threshold is increased, and the graph reduction is triggered again to generate another adjacency graph. By repeating the processing, multiple adjacency graphs are computed, and a level of detail (LoD) representation of the FEA data is established. In the third stage, the LoD structure is rendered by using a splatting method. At first, a level of adjacency graph is selected by users. The graph vertices arc sorted based on their visibility orders and projected onto the image plane in back-to-front order. Billboards are used to render the vertices in the projection. The function values, gradients, and influence scopes of the vertices are utilized to decide the colors, opacities, orientations, and shapes of the billboards.

Although level-set-based methods are advantageous because they can handle complicated topologies and noisy data, most tend to smooth the inherent roughness of the original data. Our objective is to enhance the quality of a reconstructed surface by preserving certain roughness-related characteristics of the original dataset. Our formulation employs the total variation of the surface as a roughness measure. The algorithm consists of two steps: a roughness-capturing flow and a roughness-preserving flow. The roughness capturing step attempts to construct a surface for which the original roughness is captured - distance flow is well suited for roughness capturing. Surface reconstruction is enhanced by using a total variation preserving (TVP) scheme for the roughness-preserving flow. The shock filter formulation of Osher and Rudin is exploited to achieve this goal. In practice, we have found that better results arc obtained by balancing the TVP term with a smoothing term based on curvature. The algorithm is applied to both fractal surface growth simulations and scanned data sets to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.","article_number":"1372204","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1372204","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372204/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372204/","publication_title":"IEEE

After our presentations, we encourage interaction with the audience to see if we can further formulate and perhaps finalize our list of top unresolved problems in visualization.","article_number":"1372243","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1372243","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372243/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization 2004","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-15 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9449,"is_number":29999,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-15 Oct. 2004","start_page":"563","end_page":"566","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":188,"insert_date":"20050228","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Assembly","Collaborative work","Art","Conferences","Space technology","Computer graphics","Chaos","Hardware","Design methodology"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["visualization","top unresolved problems"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8788-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.2004.78","title":"Panel 3: The Future Visualization Platform","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8788-0","rank":125,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Texas, Austin, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37269399700","id":37269399700,"full_name":"G.

For example, programmable graphics processors are redefining the traditional visualization cycle. In some cases it is now possible to run the computational simulation and associated visualization side-by-side on the same chip. Moreover, global illumination and non-photorealistic effects promise to deliver imagery which enables greater insight into high resolution, multivariate, and higher-dimensional data. The panelists will offer distinct viewpoints on the direction of future graphics hardware and its potential impact on visualization, and on the nature of advanced visualizationrelated tools and techniques. Presentation of these viewpoints will be followed by audience participation in the form of a question and answer period moderated by the panel organizer.","article_number":"1372245","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1372245","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372245/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization 2004","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-15 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9449,"is_number":29999,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-15 Oct. 2004","start_page":"569","end_page":"571","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":67,"insert_date":"20050228","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Graphics","Lighting","Hardware","Rendering (computer graphics)","Atmospheric modeling","Computational modeling","Light scattering","Particle scattering","Kirk field collapse effect"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["future","visualization","hardware","techniques"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8788-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.2004.79","title":"Panel 4: What Should We Teach in a Scientific Visualization Class?","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8788-0","rank":126,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Alaska Fairbanks","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/924470452585284","id":924470452585284,"full_name":"J.D.

So the question becomes \"how do we teach SciVis to this generation of students?\" Some examples of current courses are: A graduate Computer Science (CS) course that prepares the next generation of SciVis researchers. An undergraduate CS course that prepares the future software architects/developers of packages such as vtk, vis5D and AVS. A class that teaches students how to do SciVis with existing software packages and how to deal with the lack of interoperability between those packages (via either a CS service course or a supercomputing center training course). An inter-disciplinary course designed to prepare computer scientists to work with the \"real\" scientists (via either a CS or Computational Science course). In this panel, we will discuss these types of courses and the advantages and disadvantages of each. We will also talk about some issues that you have probably encountered at your university: How do we keep the graphics/vis-oriented students from going to industry? How does SciVis fit in with evolving Computational Science programs? Is SciVis destined to be a service course at most universities? How do we deal with the diverse backgrounds of students that need SciVis?","article_number":"1372246","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1372246","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372246/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization 2004","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-15 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9449,"is_number":29999,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-15 Oct. 2004","start_page":"573","end_page":"575","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":107,"insert_date":"20050228","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Software packages","Packaging","Graphics","Computer science","Libraries","Layout","Analytical models","Algorithm design and analysis","Geometry"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8788-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.2004.77","title":"Panel 2: In the Eye of the Beholder: The Role of Perception in Scientific Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-7803-8788-0","rank":127,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Texas at Austin","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282571800","id":37282571800,"full_name":"K.

This growth has given rise to advances in scientific and engineering simulations that have put a high demand on tools for high-performance large-scale data exploration and analysis. These simulations have the potential to generate large amounts of data. Humans, however are relatively poor at gaining insight from raw numerical data, and as a result, have used visualization as a tool for understanding, interpreting and exploring data of all types and sizes. Allowing for efficient visual explorations of data, however, requires that the ratio of knowledge gained versus the cost of the visualization be maximized. This, in turn, mandates the integration of principles from human perception. Understanding perception as it relates to visualization requires that we understand not only the biology of the human visual system, but principles from vision theory, and perceptual psychology as well. This panel is the result of bringing together practioners and researchers from a broad spectrum of interests relating to the ability to maximize the amount of information that is effectively perceived from a given visualization. Position statements will be given by researchers interested in perceptual psychology and the perception of natural images, integrating art and design principles, non-photorealistic rendering techniques, and the use of global illumination methods to provide benefical perceptual cues.","article_number":"1372244","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1372244","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372244/","publication_title":"IEEE Visualization 2004","conference_location":"Austin, TX, USA","conference_dates":"10-15 Oct. 2004","publication_number":9449,"is_number":29999,"publication_year":2004,"publication_date":"10-15 Oct. 2004","start_page":"567","end_page":"568","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":106,"insert_date":"20050228","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Humans","Computational modeling","Psychology","Evolution (biology)","Problem-solving","Data engineering","Analytical models","Large-scale systems","Data analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["perception","visualization","human visual system"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8788-0","isbnType":"Historical"}]}}]}
