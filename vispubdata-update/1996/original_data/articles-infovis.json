Effective visualizations make important features of the data immediately recognizable and enable the user to discover interesting and useful results by highlighting patterns. A key element of such systems is the ability to interact with displays of data by selecting a subset for further investigation. This operation is needed for use in linked-views systems and in drill-down analysis. It is a common manipulation in many other systems. It is as ubiquitous as selecting icons in a desktop GUI. It is therefore surprising to note that little research has been done on how selection can be implemented. This paper addresses this omission, presenting a taxonomy for selection mechanisms and discussing the interactions between branches of the taxonomy. Our suggestion of 524,288 possible systems [2/sup 16/ operation systems/spl times/2 (memory/memoryless)/spl times/2 (data-dependent/independent)/spl times/2 (brush/lasso)] is more in fun than serious, as within the taxonomy there are many different choices that can be made.

The system is built around two separate neural network methodologies: context vectors and self-organizing maps.

Self-organizing maps (SOMs) are capable of transforming an input, high dimensional signal space into a much lower (usually two or three) dimensional output space useful for visualization. Neither process requires human intervention, nor an external knowledge base. Together, these neural network techniques can be utilized to automatically identify the relevant information themes present in a corpus, and present those themes to the user in a intuitive visual form.","article_number":"559228","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=559228","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/559228/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/559228/","publication_title":"Proceedings IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization '96","conference_location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","conference_dates":"28-29 Oct. 1996","publication_number":4136,"is_number":12180,"publication_year":1996,"publication_date":"28-29 Oct. 1996","start_page":"100","end_page":"107","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":2,"download_count":101,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Image retrieval","Routing","Neural networks","Space technology","Organizing","Geometry","Algorithm design and analysis","Statistics","Information retrieval"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7668-X","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.1996.559220","title":"Minimally-immersive interactive volumetric information visualization","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-7668-X","partnum":"96TB100083","rank":7,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"CSEE Department, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282598900","id":37282598900,"full_name":"D.S.

In particular the Harmony Information Landscape visualises the hierarchical structure of Hyper-G spaces upon a plane in three-dimensional space. The Harmony Information Landscape has now been extended to display a combined structure and link map by selectively superimposing hyperlink relationships in the vertical dimension above and below the hierarchy map. In addition, documents returned by search queries may be selectively \"plotted\" in the landscape, indicating their whereabouts in a broader context, and several sets of 3D icons are available for representing the various document types.","article_number":"559218","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=559218","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/559218/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/559218/","publication_title":"Proceedings IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization '96","conference_location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","conference_dates":"28-29 Oct. 1996","publication_number":4136,"is_number":12180,"publication_year":1996,"publication_date":"28-29 Oct. 1996","start_page":"62","end_page":"63","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":8,"download_count":101,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Space technology","Data visualization","Displays","File systems","Information processing","Information management","Navigation","Web server","Indexing","Cities and towns"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7668-X","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.1996.559225","title":"Geospatial metadata querying and visualization on the WWW using Java/sup TM/ applets","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-7668-X","partnum":"96TB100083","rank":11,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Naval Research Laboratory, Mar, Inc., Monterrey, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349545700","id":37349545700,"full_name":"N.

The MBone, like the Internet itself grew exponentially with no central authority. The resulting suboptimal topology is of growing concern to network providers and the multicast research community. We create a geographic representation of the tunnel structure as arcs on a globe by resolving the latitude and longitude of MBone routers. The interactive 3D maps permit an immediate understanding of the global structure unavailable from the data in its original form as lines of text with only hostnames and IP addresses. Data visualization techniques such as grouping and thresholding allow further analysis of specific aspects of the MBone topology.
