The search for a transfer function is treated as a parameter optimization problem and addressed with stochastic search techniques. Starting from an initial population of (random or pre-defined) transfer functions, the evolution of the stochastic algorithms is controlled by either direct user selection of intermediate images or automatic fitness evaluation using user-specified objective functions. This approach essentially shields the user from the complex and tedious \"trial and error\" approach, and demonstrates effective and convenient generation of transfer functions.","article_number":"568113","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568113","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568113/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568113/","publication_title":"Proceedings of Seventh Annual IEEE Visualization '96","conference_location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","conference_dates":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","publication_number":4271,"is_number":12277,"publication_year":1996,"publication_date":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","start_page":"227","end_page":"234","citing_paper_count":32,"citing_patent_count":6,"download_count":189,"insert_date":"20140811","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Transfer functions","Stochastic processes","Data visualization","Rendering (computer graphics)","Computer science","Automatic control","Medical simulation","Biomedical engineering","Data engineering"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-89791-864-9","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1996.568123","title":"Volume thinning for automatic isosurface propagation","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-89791-864-9","partnum":"96CB36006","rank":2,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Res.

We previously proposed an extrema graph method (T. Itoh and K. Koyamada, 1995), which generates a graph connecting extremum points. The isosurface propagation starts from some of the intersected cells that are found both by visiting the cells through which arcs of the graph pass and by visiting the cells on the boundary of a volume. We propose an efficient method of searching for cells intersected by an isosurface. This method generates a volumetric skeleton. consisting of cells, like an extrema graph, by applying a thinning algorithm used in the image recognition area. Since it preserves the topological features of the volume and the connectivity of the extremum points, it necessarily intersects every isosurface. The method is more efficient than the extrema graph method, since it does not require that cells on the boundary be visited.","article_number":"568123","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568123","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568123/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568123/","publication_title":"Proceedings of Seventh Annual IEEE Visualization '96","conference_location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","conference_dates":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","publication_number":4271,"is_number":12277,"publication_year":1996,"publication_date":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","start_page":"303","end_page":"310","citing_paper_count":22,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":27,"insert_date":"20180322","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Isosurfaces","Skeleton","Image recognition","Laboratories","Art","Joining processes","Numerical simulation","Visualization","Displays","Silver"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-89791-864-9","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1996.568138","title":"Wavelets applied to lossless compression and progressive transmission of floating point data in 3-D curvilinear grids","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-89791-864-9","partnum":"96CB36006","rank":3,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"NSF Engineering Research Center for CFS, Mississippi State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37851592800","id":37851592800,"full_name":"A.

In this method a potential field is formed around a tangled rope that causes it to self-repel. By allowing the rope to evolve in this field in search of an energy minimizing configuration we can determine the knot type of the initial configuration. In particular, it is natural to conjecture that if such a \"charged rope\" was not initially knotted, it will reach its minimal potential in a circular configuration, given a suitable energy functional. Because situations potentially arise in which the functional may not be strictly unimodal, we suggest it to be advantageous to use a robust stochastic optimization technique (simulated annealing), rather than a deterministic hill climber common in physically based approaches, to make sure that the evolving rope does not settle in a suboptimal configuration. The same method is applicable to simplifying arbitrary knots and links and for establishing knot equivalence. Aside from its theoretical appeal, the method promises to solve practical problems common in genetic research and polymer design.","article_number":"568120","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568120","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568120/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568120/","publication_title":"Proceedings of Seventh Annual IEEE Visualization '96","conference_location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","conference_dates":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","publication_number":4271,"is_number":12277,"publication_year":1996,"publication_date":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","start_page":"279","end_page":"286","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":24,"insert_date":"20180322","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Stochastic processes","Visualization","Polynomials","Laboratories","Mathematics","Radiology","Optimization methods","Simulated annealing","Robustness","Genetics"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-89791-864-9","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1996.568150","title":"Interactive exploration and modeling of large data sets: a case study with Venus light scattering data","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-89791-864-9","partnum":"96CB36006","rank":5,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Netherlands Energy Res.

In this way high rendering performance with interactive frame rates can be achieved. We apply the technique to render large numbers of integral curves in a vector field.

Several algorithms were developed to reduce the number of triangles required to approximate such objects. Algorithms that measure the deviation between the approximated object and the original object are only available for special cases. We use the Hausdorff distance between the original and the simplified mesh as a geometrically meaningful error value which can be applied to arbitrary triangle meshes. We present a new algorithm to reduce the number of triangles of a mesh without exceeding a user defined Hausdorff distance between the original and simplified mesh. As this distance is parameterization independent, its use as error measure is superior to the use of the L/sup /spl infin//-Norm between parameterized surfaces. Furthermore the Hausdorff distance is always less than the distance induced by the L/sup /spl infin//-Norm. This results in higher reduction rates. Excellent results were achieved by the new decimation algorithm for triangle meshes that has been used in different application areas such as volume rendering, terrain modeling and the approximations of parameterized surfaces. The key advantages of the new algorithm are: it guarantees a user defined position dependent approximation error; it allows one to generate a hierarchical geometric representation in a canonical way; it automatically preserves sharp edges.","article_number":"568124","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568124","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568124/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568124/","publication_title":"Proceedings of Seventh Annual IEEE Visualization '96","conference_location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","conference_dates":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","publication_number":4271,"is_number":12277,"publication_year":1996,"publication_date":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","start_page":"311","end_page":"318","citing_paper_count":64,"citing_patent_count":7,"download_count":284,"insert_date":"20090304","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Error correction","Solid modeling","Rendering (computer graphics)","Computer graphics","Approximation algorithms","Approximation error","Hardware","Merging","Mesh generation","Chromium"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-89791-864-9","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1996.568121","title":"Isosurfacing in span space with utmost efficiency (ISSUE)","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-89791-864-9","partnum":"96CB36006","rank":11,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Dept. of Comput.

In the absence of integrated presentation of data and its associated uncertainty, the analysis of the visualization is incomplete at best and may lead to inaccurate or incorrect conclusions. The article presents UFLOW-a system for visualizing uncertainty in fluid flow. Although there are several sources of uncertainties in fluid flow data, in this work, we focus on uncertainty arising from the use of different numerical algorithms for computing particle traces in a fluid flow. The techniques that we have employed to visualize uncertainty in fluid flow include uncertainty glyphs, flow envelopes, animations, priority sequences, twirling batons of trace viewpoints, and rakes. These techniques are effective in making the users aware of the effects of different integration methods and their sensitivity, especially near critical points in the flow field.","article_number":"568116","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568116","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568116/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568116/","publication_title":"Proceedings of Seventh Annual IEEE Visualization '96","conference_location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","conference_dates":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","publication_number":4271,"is_number":12277,"publication_year":1996,"publication_date":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","start_page":"249","end_page":"254","citing_paper_count":44,"citing_patent_count":3,"download_count":348,"insert_date":"20090304","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty","Fluid flow","Data visualization","Animation","Computer science","Computer errors","Data flow computing","Pipelines","Computer displays","Humans"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-89791-864-9","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1996.567807","title":"Volume tracking","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-89791-864-9","partnum":"96CB36006","rank":13,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and CAIP, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274132700","id":37274132700,"full_name":"D.

Rendering is done in software, eliminating the need for special graphics hardware, as well as any artifacts associated with graphics hardware. Images of volumes with about 1,000,000 cells can be produced in one to several minutes on a workstation with a 150-MHz processor. A significant advantage of this method for applications such as computational fluid dynamics is that it can process multiple intersecting grids. Such grids present problems for most current volume rendering techniques. Also, the wide range of cell sizes does not present difficulties, as it does for many techniques. A spatial hierarchical organization makes it possible to access data from a restricted region efficiently. The tree has greater depth in regions of greater detail, determined by the number of cells in the region. It also makes it possible to render useful \"preview\" images very quickly by displaying each region associated with a tree node as one cell. Previews show enough detail to navigate effectively in very large data sets. The algorithmic techniques include use of a k-d tree, with prefix-order partitioning of triangles, to reduce the number of primitives that must be processed for one rendering, coarse-grain parallelism for a shared-memory MIMD architecture, a new perspective transformation that achieves greater numerical accuracy, and a scanline algorithm with depth sorting and a new clipping technique.","article_number":"567606","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=567606","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567606/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567606/","publication_title":"Proceedings of Seventh Annual IEEE Visualization '96","conference_location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","conference_dates":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","publication_number":4271,"is_number":12277,"publication_year":1996,"publication_date":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","start_page":"57","end_page":"63","citing_paper_count":33,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":75,"insert_date":"20090304","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Graphics","Hardware","Partitioning algorithms","Workstations","Application software","Computational fluid dynamics","Navigation","Parallel processing","Sorting"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-89791-864-9","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1996.567610","title":"Visualization over the World Wide Web and its application to environmental data","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-89791-864-9","partnum":"96CB36006","rank":16,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Leeds, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273103500","id":37273103500,"full_name":"J.

The picture is returned to the viewer as VRML, for exploration via a VRML viewer such as Webspace.

In aerial views, only the part of the scene that is close to the viewing point needs to be displayed with a high level of detail, while more distant parts can be displayed with a low level of detail. However, when a sequence of images is generated and displayed in real-time, the transition between different levels of detail causes noticeable temporal aliasing. In this paper, we propose a method, based on object blending, that visually softens the transition between two levels of Delaunay triangulation. We present an algorithm that establishes, in an off-line process, a correspondence between two given polygonal objects. The correspondence enables on-line blending between two representations of an object, so that one representation (level of detail) progressively evolves into the other.","article_number":"567600","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=567600","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567600/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567600/","publication_title":"Proceedings of Seventh Annual IEEE Visualization '96","conference_location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","conference_dates":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","publication_number":4271,"is_number":12277,"publication_year":1996,"publication_date":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","start_page":"37","end_page":"42","citing_paper_count":28,"citing_patent_count":4,"download_count":110,"insert_date":"20090304","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Layout","Rendering (computer graphics)","Aerospace simulation","Approximation algorithms","Image generation","Computer graphics","Application software","Computational modeling","Computer simulation","Tin"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-89791-864-9","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1996.567602","title":"BLaC-wavelets: a multiresolution analysis with non-nested spaces","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-89791-864-9","partnum":"96CB36006","rank":20,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Laboratoire LMC, CNRS, Grenoble, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37368609100","id":37368609100,"full_name":"G.-P.

Classical multiresolution analysis is based on the knowledge of a nested set of functional spaces in which the successive approximations of a given function converge to that function, and can be efficiently computed. This paper first proposes a theoretical framework which enables multiresolution analysis even if the functional spaces are not nested, as long as they still have the property that the successive approximations converge to the given function. Based on this concept, we finally introduce a new multiresolution analysis with exact reconstruction for large data sets defined on uniform grids. We construct a one-parameter family of multiresolution analyses which is a blending of Haar and linear multiresolution, using BLaC (Blending of Linear and Constant) wavelets.","article_number":"567602","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=567602","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567602/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567602/","publication_title":"Proceedings of Seventh Annual IEEE Visualization '96","conference_location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","conference_dates":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","publication_number":4271,"is_number":12277,"publication_year":1996,"publication_date":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","start_page":"43","end_page":"48","citing_paper_count":23,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":84,"insert_date":"20090304","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Multiresolution analysis","Wavelet analysis","Wavelet coefficients","Solid modeling","Image coding","Computer graphics","Lighting","Image reconstruction","Signal resolution","Continuous wavelet transforms"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-89791-864-9","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1996.568105","title":"LISTEN: sounding uncertainty visualization","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-89791-864-9","partnum":"96CB36006","rank":21,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37298532100","id":37298532100,"full_name":"S.K.

The method based on Distance Field Interpolation (DFI) gives a robust solution to this problem in its ability to deal with any topology in any dimension. Still this method may give undesired solutions to the problem if the changes from one cross-section to the next are significant relative to the size of the details in the cross-sections. We consider the problem of solid reconstruction from contours, which can also be considered as a contour blending or contour morphing problem, where the third dimension is time. The method presented is based on interpolation of the distance field, guided by a warp function which is controlled by a set of corresponding anchor points. Some rules for defining a smooth least-distorting warp function are given. To reduce the distortion of the intermediate shapes, the warp function is decomposed into a rigid rotational part and an elastic part. The distance field interpolation method is modified so that the interpolation is guided by the warp function. The advantage of the new approach is that it is capable of blending between contours having different topological genus, and no correspondence between the geometric primitives should be established. The desired general correspondence is defined by the user in terms of a relatively small number of anchor points.","article_number":"567812","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=567812","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567812/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567812/","publication_title":"Proceedings of Seventh Annual IEEE Visualization '96","conference_location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","conference_dates":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","publication_number":4271,"is_number":12277,"publication_year":1996,"publication_date":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","start_page":"165","end_page":"172","citing_paper_count":16,"citing_patent_count":3,"download_count":162,"insert_date":"20090304","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Interpolation","Image reconstruction","Shape","Topology","Animation","Pixel","Robustness","Solids","Biomedical imaging","Algorithm design and analysis"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-89791-864-9","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1996.568128","title":"Virtual Workbench-a non-immersive virtual environment for visualizing and interacting with 3D objects for scientific visualization","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-89791-864-9","partnum":"96CB36006","rank":25,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Naval Research Laboratory, Inc., WA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37378425700","id":37378425700,"full_name":"U.

Examples include tissue and tumor boundaries in medical imaging, molecular surfaces and force thresholds in chemical and pharmaceutical applications, and isosurfaces in a wide range of 3D domains. The 3D shape of such surfaces can be particularly difficult to interpret because of the unfamiliar, irregular shapes, the potential concavities and bulges, and the lack of parallel lines and right angles to provide perspective depth cues. Attempts to display multiple irregular surfaces by making some or all of them transparent further complicates the problem. Texture can provide valuable cues to aid in the interpretation of irregular surfaces. Opacity-modulating textures offer a mechanism for the display of multiple surfaces without the extreme loss of clarity of multiple transparent surfaces.

Recognizing the importance of unifying these processes, we present a new approach to the direct rendering of deformable volumes without explicitly constructing the intermediate deformed volumes. The volume deformation is done by a radial basis function that is piecewise linearly approximated by an adaptive subdivision of the octree encoded target volume. The octree blocks in the target volume are then projected, reverse morphed and texture mapped, using the SGI 3D texture mapping hardware, in a back-to-front order. A template-based Z-plane/block intersection method is used to expedite the block projection computation.","article_number":"567609","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=567609","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567609/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567609/","publication_title":"Proceedings of Seventh Annual IEEE Visualization '96","conference_location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","conference_dates":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","publication_number":4271,"is_number":12277,"publication_year":1996,"publication_date":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","start_page":"73","end_page":"80","citing_paper_count":11,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":201,"insert_date":"20090304","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Encoding","Hardware","Rendering (computer graphics)","Visualization","Deformable models","Computational efficiency","Solid modeling","Interpolation","Software algorithms","Animation"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-89791-864-9","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1996.567796","title":"Flexible information visualization of multivariate data from biological sequence similarity searches","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-89791-864-9","partnum":"96CB36006","rank":30,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computational Biology Centers, Medical School, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087757864","id":37087757864,"full_name":"E.H.-H.

Previously, we presented a system for visualizing similarities between a single DNA sequence and a large database of other DNA sequences (E.H. Chi et al., 1995). Similarity algorithms generate similarity information in textual reports that can be hundreds or thousands of pages long. Our original system visualized the most important variables from these reports. However, the biologists we work with found this system so useful they requested visual representations of other variables. We present an enhanced system for interactive exploration of this multivariate data. We identify a larger set of useful variables in the information space. The new system involves more variables, so it focuses on exploring subsets of the data. We present an interactive system allowing mapping of different variables to different axes, incorporating animation using a time axis, and providing tools for viewing subsets of the data. Detail-on-demand is preserved by hyperlinks to the analysis reports. We present three case studies illustrating the use of these techniques. The combined technique of applying a time axis with a 3D scatter plot and query filters to visualization of biological sequence similarity data is both powerful and novel.","article_number":"567796","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=567796","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567796/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567796/","publication_title":"Proceedings of Seventh Annual IEEE Visualization '96","conference_location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","conference_dates":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","publication_number":4271,"is_number":12277,"publication_year":1996,"publication_date":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","start_page":"133","end_page":"140","citing_paper_count":11,"citing_patent_count":3,"download_count":116,"insert_date":"20090304","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Multidimensional systems","Visual databases","Computer science","Computational biology","DNA","Animation","Image analysis","Image sequence analysis","Biological system modeling"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-89791-864-9","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1996.568139","title":"Directional flow visualization of vector fields","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-89791-864-9","partnum":"96CB36006","rank":31,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37372278100","id":37372278100,"full_name":"E.

Varying the lighting conditions, by moving the light source and/or adding more lights, emphasizes different vector directions, set of directions, and vectors within a specified angle of a particular direction. The methods are straight forward, computationally inexpensive, and can be combined with other techniques that use glyph representation and other flow geometry such as streamlines for feature visualization.

Most applications rely on image level comparison such as experimental flow visualization versus computational flow imagery (CFI) which tries to simulate optical image acquisition in flow testing. When differences become difficult to distinguish or once a quantitative result is required, data level comparison provides powerful means to visualize data from multiple sources. Data level comparison and visualization turns out to be an essential tool in modern aircraft design projects.

Computational fluid dynamics data is in principle well suited for DVR. But efficient mappings of the directional information of vector fields are still to be found. We investigate how the raycasting technique can be used to directly render vector fields. Our approach is based on the perception that other flow visualization techniques use visualization objects that are locally tangential to the vector field together with directed light sources. From this, we developed the idea to shade streamlines at sampling points when raycasting a vector field. We extended this approach further to more abstract mappings where pseudo color is used. Combining opacity mapping, pseudo color mapping, and streamline shading we can express flow speed and flow direction together in one single image.","article_number":"567780","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=567780","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567780/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567780/","publication_title":"Proceedings of Seventh Annual IEEE Visualization '96","conference_location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","conference_dates":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","publication_number":4271,"is_number":12277,"publication_year":1996,"publication_date":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","start_page":"115","end_page":"120","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":107,"insert_date":"20090304","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Animation","Streaming media","Color","Rendering (computer graphics)","Shape","Computer graphics","World Wide Web","Spatial resolution","Merging"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-89791-864-9","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1996.568163","title":"Information Exploration Shootout or \"Benchmarks for Information Exploration\"","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-89791-864-9","partnum":"96CB36006","rank":44,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"MITRE Corporation, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37360588500","id":37360588500,"full_name":"G.

Stereo audio or spatial audio processing techniques are employed to enhance the perception of the representative sonification as emanating from the visual loci of the associated voxel.","article_number":"568129","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568129","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568129/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568129/","publication_title":"Proceedings of Seventh Annual IEEE Visualization '96","conference_location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","conference_dates":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","publication_number":4271,"is_number":12277,"publication_year":1996,"publication_date":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","start_page":"351","end_page":"354","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":2,"download_count":123,"insert_date":"20090304","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Feedback","Graphical user interfaces","Packaging","Image analysis","Information analysis","Speech recognition","Graphics","Control systems","Electronic mail"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-89791-864-9","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1996.568143","title":"A 3-D contextual shading method for visualization of diecasting defects","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-89791-864-9","partnum":"96CB36006","rank":48,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37858270000","id":37858270000,"full_name":"S.C.

We use a vector voting method to interpolate, from sparse data, three dense potential fields for surfaces, edges, and junctions. The global voting interpolants encode several human perceptual grouping principles such as cosurfacity, proximity, and constancy of curvature. The inferred potential fields are stored in three volumetric grids, giving each voxel the probability of being a surface point, an edge point, and a junction point. Then we use a new model called \"winged B snakes\", which are deformable triangular NURBS surfaces embedded with active curves, to fit the surfaces and align the edges and junctions. Finally, a smooth C/sup 1/ surface which preserves discontinuity edges and junctions is constructed. Fine tuning and surface fairing is done by adjusting the weights.","article_number":"568122","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568122","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568122/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568122/","publication_title":"Proceedings of Seventh Annual IEEE Visualization '96","conference_location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","conference_dates":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","publication_number":4271,"is_number":12277,"publication_year":1996,"publication_date":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","start_page":"295","end_page":"302","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":54,"insert_date":"20180322","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Spline","Surface topography","Surface reconstruction","Scattering","Intelligent robots","Robot kinematics","Intelligent systems","Data visualization","Polynomials","Equations"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-89791-864-9","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1996.568130","title":"Results in mathematics and music: visualization of roughness in musical consonance","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-89791-864-9","partnum":"96CB36006","rank":50,"authors":{"authors":[{"authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087663261","id":37087663261,"full_name":"F.

This behavior was exploited in generating the constrained fractal surfaces in the work of Szeliski and Terzopoulos (1989), which were generated by using a Gibbs sampler algorithm. The algorithm involves locally perturbing a constrained spline surface with white noise until the spline surface reaches an equilibrium state. In this paper, we introduce a very fast generalized Gibbs sampler that combines two novel techniques, namely a preconditioning technique in a wavelet basis for constraining the splines and a perturbation scheme in which, unlike the traditional Gibbs sampler, all sites (surface nodes) that do not share a common neighbor are updated simultaneously. In addition, we demonstrate the capability to generate arbitrary-order fractal surfaces without resorting to blending techniques. Using this fast Gibbs sampler algorithm, we demonstrate the synthesis of realistic terrain models from sparse elevation data.","article_number":"567598","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=567598","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567598/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567598/","publication_title":"Proceedings of Seventh Annual IEEE Visualization '96","conference_location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","conference_dates":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","publication_number":4271,"is_number":12277,"publication_year":1996,"publication_date":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","start_page":"29","end_page":"35","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":77,"insert_date":"20090304","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Fractals","Computer graphics","Shape control","Biomembranes","Numerical analysis","Application software","Frequency","White noise","Surface waves","Iterative algorithms"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-89791-864-9","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1996.568141","title":"A system for measuring surface facet orientation from atomic force microscope data","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-89791-864-9","partnum":"96CB36006","rank":56,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computing and Applied Mathematics Laboratory, National Institute for Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37392147700","id":37392147700,"full_name":"J.

This paper presents a decimation method to reduce the number of triangles generated. Decimation is carried out before creating a large number of triangles. Four major steps comprise the algorithm: surface tracking, merging, crack patching and triangulation. Surface tracking is an enhanced implementation of the MC algorithm. Starting from a seed point, the surface tracker visits only those cells likely to compose part of the desired isosurface. The cells making up the extracted surface are stored in an octree that is further processed. A bottom-up approach is taken in merging the cells containing a relatively flat approximating surface. The finer surface details are maintained. Cells are merged as long as the error due to such an operation is within a user-specified error parameter, or a cell acquires more than one connected surface component in it. A crack patching method is described that forces edges of smaller cells to lie along those of the larger neighboring cells. The overall saving in the number of triangles depends both on the specified error value and the nature of the data. Use of the hierarchical octree data structure also presents the potential of incremental representation of surfaces. We can generate a highly smoothed surface representation which can be progressively refined as the user-specified error value is decreased.","article_number":"568127","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568127","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568127/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568127/","publication_title":"Proceedings of Seventh Annual IEEE Visualization '96","conference_location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","conference_dates":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","publication_number":4271,"is_number":12277,"publication_year":1996,"publication_date":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","start_page":"335","end_page":"342","citing_paper_count":77,"citing_patent_count":9,"download_count":634,"insert_date":"20090304","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Surface cracks","Isosurfaces","Biomedical engineering","Biomedical computing","Information science","Merging","Data visualization","Frequency","Magnetic resonance imaging","Head"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-89791-864-9","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1996.568110","title":"Illustrating transparent surfaces with curvature-directed strokes","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-89791-864-9","partnum":"96CB36006","rank":62,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"ICASE, NASA-Langley Research Center, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282637800","id":37282637800,"full_name":"V.

However, in computer-generated pictures-as in photographs and in directly viewed actual objects-it can often be difficult to adequately perceive the three-dimensional shape of a layered transparent surface or its relative depth distance from underlying structures. Inspired by artists' use of line to show shape, we have explored methods for automatically defining a distributed set of opaque surface markings that intend to portray the three-dimensional shape and relative depth of a smoothly curving layered transparent surface in an intuitively meaningful (and minimally occluding) way. This paper describes the perceptual motivation, artistic inspiration and practical implementation of an algorithm for \"texturing\" a transparent surface with uniformly distributed opaque short strokes, locally oriented in the direction of greatest normal curvature, and of length proportional to the magnitude of the surface curvature in the stroke direction. The driving application for this work is the visualization of layered surfaces in radiation therapy treatment planning data, and the technique is illustrated on transparent isointensity surfaces of radiation dose.","article_number":"568110","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568110","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568110/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568110/","publication_title":"Proceedings of Seventh Annual IEEE Visualization '96","conference_location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","conference_dates":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","publication_number":4271,"is_number":12277,"publication_year":1996,"publication_date":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","start_page":"211","end_page":"218","citing_paper_count":26,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":88,"insert_date":"20090304","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Shape","Surface treatment","Data visualization","NASA","Biomedical applications of radiation","Displays","Biomedical imaging","Layout","Optical refraction","Psychology"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-89791-864-9","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1996.567608","title":"Fast perspective volume rendering with splatting by utilizing a ray-driven approach","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-89791-864-9","partnum":"96CB36006","rank":63,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Biomed.

In this technique, reconstruction is achieved by a convolution, which collects the contribution of multiple voxels to one sample point. Splatting, on the other hand, is based on projecting data points on to the screen, and reconstruction is implemented by an \"inverted convolution\", where the contribution of one data element is distributed to many sample points (i.e. pixels). Splatting produces images of a quality comparable to ray casting but at greater speeds. This is achieved by pre-computing the projection footprint that the interpolation kernel leaves on the image plane. However, while fast incremental schemes can be utilized for orthographic projection, the perspective projection complicates the mapping of the footprints and is therefore rather slow. In this paper, we merge the technique of splatting with the principles of ray casting to yield a ray-driven splatting approach. We imagine splats as being suspended in object space, a splat at every voxel. Rays are then spawned to traverse the space and intersect the splats. An efficient and accurate way of intersecting and addressing the splats is described. Not only is ray-driven splatting inherently insensitive to the complexity of the perspective viewing transform, it also offers acceleration methods such as early ray termination and bounding volumes, which are methods that traditional voxel-driven splatting cannot benefit from. This results in competitive or superior performance for parallel projection, and superior performance for perspective projection.","article_number":"567608","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=567608","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567608/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567608/","publication_title":"Proceedings of Seventh Annual IEEE Visualization '96","conference_location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","conference_dates":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","publication_number":4271,"is_number":12277,"publication_year":1996,"publication_date":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","start_page":"65","end_page":"72","citing_paper_count":25,"citing_patent_count":5,"download_count":101,"insert_date":"20180322","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Image reconstruction","Equations","Optical attenuators","Subspace constraints","Computed tomography","Displays","Angiography","Interpolation","Acceleration"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-89791-864-9","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1996.568103","title":"Complex-valued contour meshing","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-89791-864-9","partnum":"96CB36006","rank":64,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Mississippi State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282585600","id":37282585600,"full_name":"C.

Visualizing and interacting with these hierarchies become daunting tasks. The problem is exacerbated if the visualization is to be done on mass-market personal computers, with limited processing power and visual resolution. Many of the current visualization techniques work effectively for hierarchies of 1000 nodes, but as the number of nodes increases toward 5000, these techniques tend to break down. Hierarchies above 5000 nodes usually require special modifications such as clustering, which can affect visual stability. This paper introduces Cheops, a novel approach to the representation, browsing and exploration of huge, complex information hierarchies such as the Dewey Decimal Classification system, which can contain between a million and a billion nodes. The Cheops approach maintains context within a huge hierarchy, while simultaneously providing easy access to details. This paper presents some preliminary results from usability tests performed on an 8-wide-by-9-deep classification hierarchy, which if fully populated would contain over 19 million nodes.","article_number":"567745","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=567745","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567745/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/567745/","publication_title":"Proceedings of Seventh Annual IEEE Visualization '96","conference_location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","conference_dates":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","publication_number":4271,"is_number":12277,"publication_year":1996,"publication_date":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","start_page":"87","end_page":"92","citing_paper_count":21,"citing_patent_count":10,"download_count":195,"insert_date":"20090304","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Humans","Microcomputers","Usability","Computer vision","Space technology","Computer displays","Consumer electronics","Stability","Testing"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-89791-864-9","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1996.568117","title":"Time management, simultaneity and time-critical computation in interactive unsteady visualization environments","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-89791-864-9","partnum":"96CB36006","rank":66,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"NASA Ames Research Center, MRJ, Inc., USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37388808200","id":37388808200,"full_name":"S.

We use binary space partition (BSP) tree data structures to provide non-intersecting, visibility-ordered primitives for accurate opacity accumulation images. New in our system is a method of using parallel, time-shifted BSP trees to efficiently manage the continuously captured ultrasound data and to decrease the variability in image generation time between output frames. This technique is employed in a functioning real-time augmented reality system that a physician has used to examine human patients prior to breast biopsy procedures. We expect the technique can be used for real-time visualization of any 2D data being collected from a tracked sensor moving along an arbitrary path.","article_number":"568114","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=568114","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568114/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568114/","publication_title":"Proceedings of Seventh Annual IEEE Visualization '96","conference_location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","conference_dates":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","publication_number":4271,"is_number":12277,"publication_year":1996,"publication_date":"27 Oct.-1 Nov. 1996","start_page":"235","end_page":"240","citing_paper_count":11,"citing_patent_count":72,"download_count":134,"insert_date":"20090304","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Ultrasonic imaging","Data visualization","Rendering (computer graphics)","Surface texture","Tree data structures","Image generation","Real time systems","Augmented reality","Humans","Breast biopsy"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-89791-864-9","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1996.568109","title":"Two-handed interactive stereoscopic visualization","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-89791-864-9","partnum":"96CB36006","rank":68,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Science and Electrical Engineering Department, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282598900","id":37282598900,"full_name":"D.S.
