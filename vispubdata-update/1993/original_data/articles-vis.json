The rationale behind this is to exploit the sensitivity of the human visual system to texture in order to overcome the limitations inherent in the display of multidimensional data. A fundamental issue that must be addressed is what textural features are important in texture perception, and how they are used. We designed an experiment to help identify the relevant higher order features of texture perceived by humans. We used twenty subjects, who were asked to rate 56 pictures from Brodatz's album on 12 nine-point Likert scales. We applied the techniques of hierarchical cluster analysis, non-parametric multidimensional scaling (MDS), classification and regression tree analysis (CART), discriminant analysis, and principal component analysis to data gathered from the subjects. Based on these techniques, we identified three orthogonal dimensions for texture to be repetitive vs. non-repetitive; high-contrast and non-directional vs. low-contrast and directional; granular, coarse and low-complexity vs. non-granular, fine and high-complexity.<>","article_number":"398872","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=398872","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/398872/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/398872/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '93","conference_location":"San Jose, CA, USA","conference_dates":"25-29 Oct. 1993","publication_number":3180,"is_number":9012,"publication_year":1993,"publication_date":"25-29 Oct. 1993","start_page":"220","end_page":"227","citing_paper_count":46,"citing_patent_count":3,"download_count":174,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Multidimensional systems","Humans","Data visualization","Shape","Visual system","Displays","Regression tree analysis","Principal component analysis","Heart","Psychology"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-3940-7","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1993.398868","title":"Geometric optimization","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-3940-7","partnum":"93CH3354-8","rank":5,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Advanced Computing Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37378526500","id":37378526500,"full_name":"P.

Reducing polygon count without a corresponding reduction in object detail is important for: achieving interactive frame rates in scientific visualization, reducing mass storage requirements, and facilitating the transmission of large, multi-timestep geometric data sets. This paper shows how coplanar and nearly coplanar polygons can be merged into larger complex polygons and re-triangulated into fewer simple polygons than originally required. The notable contributions of this paper are: (1) a method for quickly grouping polygons into nearly coplanar sets, (2) a fast approach for merging coplanar polygon sets and, (3) a simple, robust triangulation method for polygons created by 1 and 2. The central idea of the algorithm is the notion of treating polygonal data as a collection of segments and removing redundant segments to quickly form polygon hulls which represent the merged coplanar sets.<>","article_number":"398868","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=398868","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/398868/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/398868/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '93","conference_location":"San Jose, CA, USA","conference_dates":"25-29 Oct. 1993","publication_number":3180,"is_number":9012,"publication_year":1993,"publication_date":"25-29 Oct. 1993","start_page":"189","end_page":"195","citing_paper_count":41,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":194,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Laboratories","Optimization methods","Medical simulation","Hydrodynamics","Magnetic resonance imaging","Geometry","Solid modeling","Merging","Robustness","Computer graphics"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-3940-7","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1993.398846","title":"Flow volumes for interactive vector field visualization","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-3940-7","partnum":"93CH3354-8","rank":6,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livemore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267387800","id":37267387800,"full_name":"N.

The technique band-limits the continuous object before sampling it at the desired 3-D raster resolution. By precomputing tables of filter values for different types and sizes of geometric objects, the algorithm is very efficient and has a complexity that is linear with the number of voxels generated. The algorithm not only creates voxel models which are free from object space aliasing, but it also incorporates the image space antialiasing information as part of the view independent voxel model. The resulting alias-free voxel models have been used to model synthetic scenes, for discrete ray tracing applications. The discrete ray-traced image is superior in quality to the image generated with a conventional surface-based ray tracer, since silhouettes of objects, shadows, and reflections appear smooth (jaggy-less). In addition, the alias-free models are also suitable for intermixing with sampled datasets, since they can be treated uniformly as one common data representation.<>","article_number":"398854","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=398854","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/398854/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/398854/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '93","conference_location":"San Jose, CA, USA","conference_dates":"25-29 Oct. 1993","publication_number":3180,"is_number":9012,"publication_year":1993,"publication_date":"25-29 Oct. 1993","start_page":"78","end_page":"84","citing_paper_count":36,"citing_patent_count":3,"download_count":340,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Graphics","Solid modeling","Sampling methods","Layout","Ray tracing","Rendering (computer graphics)","Space technology","Medical simulation","Computer science","Nonlinear filters"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-3940-7","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1993.398902","title":"Enhancing reality in the operating room","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-3940-7","partnum":"93CH3354-8","rank":8,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Corporate Research and Development, General Electric Company Limited, Schenectady, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37378427200","id":37378427200,"full_name":"W.

The system can process many time frames of flow fields without requiring that all the data be in memory simultaneously, and it also handles flow fields with moving grids. We have used the system to visualize streaklines from several large 3-D time-dependent flow fields with moving grids. The system was able to provide useful insights to the physical phenomena in the flow fields.<>","article_number":"398848","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=398848","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/398848/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/398848/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '93","conference_location":"San Jose, CA, USA","conference_dates":"25-29 Oct. 1993","publication_number":3180,"is_number":9012,"publication_year":1993,"publication_date":"25-29 Oct. 1993","start_page":"32","end_page":"38","citing_paper_count":22,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":115,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Aerodynamics","NASA","Data flow computing","Fluid dynamics","Computational fluid dynamics","Isosurfaces","Computational modeling","Numerical models"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-3940-7","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1993.398863","title":"InfoCrystal: A visual tool for information retrieval","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-3940-7","partnum":"93CH3354-8","rank":12,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Center for Educational Computing Initiatives, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283017700","id":37283017700,"full_name":"A.

The method is based on Reynolds decomposition of a turbulent flow field into a convective and a turbulent motion. At each step of particle path generation a stochastic perturbation is added, resulting in random-walk motions of particles. A physical relation is established between the perturbations and the eddy-diffusivity, which is calculated in a turbulent flow simulation. The flow data used is a mean velocity field, and an eddy-diffusivity field. The erratic particle motions are more than just a visual effect, but represent a real physical phenomenon. An implementation of the method is described, and an example of a turbulent channel flow is given, which clearly shows the random particle motions in their context of general fluid motion patterns.<>","article_number":"398850","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=398850","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/398850/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/398850/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '93","conference_location":"San Jose, CA, USA","conference_dates":"25-29 Oct. 1993","publication_number":3180,"is_number":9012,"publication_year":1993,"publication_date":"25-29 Oct. 1993","start_page":"46","end_page":"52","citing_paper_count":19,"citing_patent_count":2,"download_count":187,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Fluid dynamics","Data visualization","Aerodynamics","Clouds","Temperature","Rendering (computer graphics)","Animation","Mathematics","Informatics","Stochastic processes"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-3940-7","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1993.398883","title":"Computer visualization of long genomic sequences","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-3940-7","partnum":"93CH3354-8","rank":14,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087924509","id":37087924509,"full_name":"D.

This method allows a computational fluid dynamics user to visualize the basic physical process of dispersion and mixing rather than just the vector and scalar values computed by the simulation. It is based on transforming the vector field from a traditionally Eulerian reference frame into a Lagrangian reference frame. Fluid elements are traced through the vector field for the mean path as well as the statistical dispersion of the fluid elements about the mean position by using added scalar information about the root mean square value of the vector field and its Lagrangian time scale. In this way, clouds of fluid elements are traced not just mean paths.

This paper investigates the suitability of various techniques of visualizing this space. With a good technique the natural distance between orientations will be represented fairly accurately, and distortion to the \"shape\" of a collection of orientations induced by the change of reference orientation will be minor. The traditional Euler-angle parameterization fails on both counts. Less well-known techniques exploit the fact that there is a rotation that takes the reference orientation to a given one. The given orientation is represented as a point along the axis of this rotation. The distance of this point from the origin is determined by some scaling function of the magnitude of that rotation. Free natural scaling functions are studied. None is perfect, but several are satisfactory.<>","article_number":"398867","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=398867","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/398867/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/398867/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '93","conference_location":"San Jose, CA, USA","conference_dates":"25-29 Oct. 1993","publication_number":3180,"is_number":9012,"publication_year":1993,"publication_date":"25-29 Oct. 1993","start_page":"183","end_page":"188","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":95,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Earth","Crystals","Lakes","Cameras","Animation","Watches","Topology","Strips"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-3940-7","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1993.398904","title":"The virtual restoration of the Visir tomb","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-3940-7","partnum":"93CH3354-8","rank":24,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"CNUCE CNR, Pisa, Italy","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38230282100","id":38230282100,"full_name":"P.

The necessity to pre-interpret application data in order to classify object surface voxels prior to rendering has prevented many visualization methods from becoming practical. We propose the concept of vision by visualization which integrates computer vision methods into the visualization process. Based on this, we present the vision camera, a new tool allowing for interactive object recognition during volume data walkthroughs. This camera model is characterized by a flexible front-plane which, under the control of user-specified parameters and image features elastically matches to object surfaces, while shifted through a data volume. Thus, objects are interactively carved out and can be visualized by standard volume visualization methods. Implementation and application of the model are described. Our results suggest that by the integration of human and machine vision new perspectives for data exploration are opened up.<>","article_number":"398847","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=398847","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/398847/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/398847/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '93","conference_location":"San Jose, CA, USA","conference_dates":"25-29 Oct. 1993","publication_number":3180,"is_number":9012,"publication_year":1993,"publication_date":"25-29 Oct. 1993","start_page":"25","end_page":"30","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":59,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Cameras","Navigation","Data visualization","Object recognition","Surface reconstruction","Application software","Computer vision","Machine vision","Rendering (computer graphics)","Humans"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-3940-7","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1993.398866","title":"Performance visualization of parallel programs","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-3940-7","partnum":"93CH3354-8","rank":26,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Electrical Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37356141500","id":37356141500,"full_name":"A.

Three dimensional data of radial structure are best displayed in the 3D V-Plot, which has optimal track separation and presents all relevant information in a clear way.<>","article_number":"398898","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=398898","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/398898/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/398898/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '93","conference_location":"San Jose, CA, USA","conference_dates":"25-29 Oct. 1993","publication_number":3180,"is_number":9012,"publication_year":1993,"publication_date":"25-29 Oct. 1993","start_page":"386","end_page":"390","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":63,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Detectors","Event detection","Software tools","Particle tracking","Shape","Engine cylinders","Software performance","Trajectory","Magnetic fields"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-3940-7","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1993.398871","title":"Dichromatic color representations for complex display systems","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-3940-7","partnum":"93CH3354-8","rank":33,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Applied Physics, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087373837","id":37087373837,"full_name":"M.S.

Complex display systems with two primaries can be produced with significantly less work than is required for the traditional three primaries.

It exploits coherency between consecutive images to shorten the path rays take through the volume. Rays are provided with the information needed to leap over the empty space and commence volume traversal at the vicinity of meaningful data. The algorithm starts by projecting the volume onto a C-buffer (coordinates-buffer) which stores the object-space coordinates of the first non-empty voxel visible from a pixel. Following a change in the viewing parameters, the C-buffer is transformed accordingly. Next, coordinates that possibly became hidden are discarded. The remaining values serve as an estimate of the point where the new rays should start their volume traversal. This method does not require 3-D preprocessing and does not suffer from any image degradation. It can be combined with existing acceleration techniques and can support any ray traversal algorithm and material modeling scheme.<>","article_number":"398852","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=398852","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/398852/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/398852/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '93","conference_location":"San Jose, CA, USA","conference_dates":"25-29 Oct. 1993","publication_number":3180,"is_number":9012,"publication_year":1993,"publication_date":"25-29 Oct. 1993","start_page":"62","end_page":"69","citing_paper_count":53,"citing_patent_count":12,"download_count":156,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Acceleration","Animation","Casting","Sampling methods","Interpolation","Ray tracing","Information science","Degradation","Data visualization","Image converters"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-3940-7","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1993.398875","title":"Implicit stream surfaces","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-3940-7","partnum":"93CH3354-8","rank":36,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Netherlands Energy Research Foundation (ECN), Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267249200","id":37267249200,"full_name":"J.J. van Wijk","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Netherlands Energy Research Foundation (ECN), Netherlands"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Streamlines and stream surfaces are well known techniques for the visualization of fluid flow. For steady velocity fields, a streamline is the trace of a particle, and a stream surface is the trace of a curve. Here a new method is presented for the construction of stream surfaces. The central concept is the representation of a stream surface as an implicit surface f (x) = C. After the initial calculation of f a family of stream surfaces can be generated efficiently by varying C. The shapes of the originating curves are defined by the value of f at the boundary. Two techniques are presented for the calculation of f: one based on solving the convection equation, the other on backward tracing of the trajectories of grid points. The flow around objects is discussed separately. With this method irregular topologies of the originating curves and of the stream surfaces can be handled easily. Further, it can also be used for other visualization techniques, such as time surfaces and stream volumes. Finally, an effective method for the automatic placement of originating curves is presented.<>","article_number":"398875","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=398875","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/398875/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/398875/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '93","conference_location":"San Jose, CA, USA","conference_dates":"25-29 Oct. 1993","publication_number":3180,"is_number":9012,"publication_year":1993,"publication_date":"25-29 Oct. 1993","start_page":"245","end_page":"252","citing_paper_count":51,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":237,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Streaming media","Shape","Equations","Topology","Fluid flow","Image converters","Sampling methods","Cities and towns"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-3940-7","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1993.398870","title":"Navigating large networks with hierarchies","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-3940-7","partnum":"93CH3354-8","rank":37,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"AT and T Bell Laboratories, Inc., USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282570100","id":37282570100,"full_name":"S.G.

In this paper we propose a fine-grain dataflow model that takes advantage of data locality properties of many visualization algorithms. A fine-grain module works on small chunks of data one at a time by keeping a dynamically adjusted moving window on the input data stream. It is more memory efficient and has the potential of handling very large data sets without taking up all the memory resources. Two popular visualization algorithms, an iso-surface extraction algorithm and a volume rendering algorithm, are implemented using the fine-grain model. The performance measurements showed faster speed, reduced memory usage, and improved CPU utilization over a typical coarse-grain system.<>","article_number":"398860","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=398860","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/398860/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/398860/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '93","conference_location":"San Jose, CA, USA","conference_dates":"25-29 Oct. 1993","publication_number":3180,"is_number":9012,"publication_year":1993,"publication_date":"25-29 Oct. 1993","start_page":"126","end_page":"133","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":67,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Pipelines","Software systems","Central Processing Unit","Data processing","Computer science","Computer architecture","Data mining","Velocity measurement","Data engineering"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-3940-7","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1993.398880","title":"Spray rendering: Visualization using smart particles","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-3940-7","partnum":"93CH3354-8","rank":44,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Board of Studies in Computer and Information Sciences, University of California, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267352000","id":37267352000,"full_name":"A.

The goal of our system is to support the query specification process by using each pixel of the display to represent one data item of the database. By arranging and coloring the pixels according to their relevance for the query, the user gets a visual impression of the resulting data set. Using sliders for each condition of the query, the user may change the query dynamically and receives immediate feedback by the visual representation of the resulting data set. By using multiple windows for different parts of a complex query, the user gets visual feedback for each part of the query and, therefore, will easier understand the overall result. The system may be used to query any database that contains tens of thousands to millions of data items, but it is especially helpful to explore large data sets with an unknown distribution of values and to find the interesting hot spots in huge amounts of data. The direct feedback allows to visually display the influence of incremental query refinements and, therefore, allows a better, easier and faster query specification.<>","article_number":"398864","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=398864","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/398864/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/398864/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '93","conference_location":"San Jose, CA, USA","conference_dates":"25-29 Oct. 1993","publication_number":3180,"is_number":9012,"publication_year":1993,"publication_date":"25-29 Oct. 1993","start_page":"158","end_page":"165","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":3,"download_count":67,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Feedback","Visual databases","Displays","Database systems","Cooperative systems","Computer science","Data engineering","Sensor systems","Computerized monitoring","Data models"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-3940-7","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1993.398855","title":"Tioga: A database-oriented visualization tool","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-3940-7","partnum":"93CH3354-8","rank":46,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Science Division, EECS Department, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38315553400","id":38315553400,"full_name":"M.

This methodology preserves the fidelity of the original data sets in a coordinate system suitable for three-dimensional, dynamic examination of upper atmospheric phenomena.<>","article_number":"398899","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=398899","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/398899/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/398899/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '93","conference_location":"San Jose, CA, USA","conference_dates":"25-29 Oct. 1993","publication_number":3180,"is_number":9012,"publication_year":1993,"publication_date":"25-29 Oct. 1993","start_page":"391","end_page":"396","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":81,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Interpolation","Data visualization","Geometry","Geoscience","Surface morphology","Information analysis","Space vehicles","Springs","Ear","Mesh generation"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-3940-7","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1993.398884","title":"Visualization of acoustic lens data","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-3940-7","partnum":"93CH3354-8","rank":53,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Applied Physics Laboratory, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087198533","id":37087198533,"full_name":"A.J.

For a particular class of asynchronous distributed algorithms that may be characterized by independent and concurrent entities that execute asynchronously on multiple processors and interact with one another through explicit messages, the following reasoning applies. Information about the flow of messages and the activity of the processors may contribute significantly towards the conceptual understanding of the algorithm's behavior and the functional correctness of the implementation. The computation and subsequent display of important parameters, based upon the execution of the algorithm, is an important objective of DIVIDE. For instance, the mean and standard deviation values for the propagation delay of ATM cells between any two given Broadband-ISDN (BISDN) nodes in a simulation of BISDN network under stochastic input stimulus, as a function of time, are important clues to the degree of congestion in the Broadband-ISDN network. Although the execution of the algorithm typically generates high resolution data, often, a coarse-level visual representation of the data may be useful in facilitating the conceptual understanding of the behavior of the algorithm. DIVIDE permits a user to specify a resolution less than that of the data from the execution of the algorithm, which is then utilized to coalesce the data appropriately. Given that this process requires significant computational power, for efficiency, DIVIDE distributes the overall task of visual display into a number of user specified workstations that are configured as a loosely-coupled parallel processor. DIVIDE has been implemented on a heterogeneous network of SUN sparc 1 + , sparc 2, and 3/60 workstations and performance measurements indicate significant improvement over that of a uniprocessor-based visual display.<>","article_number":"398865","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=398865","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/398865/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/398865/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '93","conference_location":"San Jose, CA, USA","conference_dates":"25-29 Oct. 1993","publication_number":3180,"is_number":9012,"publication_year":1993,"publication_date":"25-29 Oct. 1993","start_page":"166","end_page":"173","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":2,"download_count":70,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Distributed algorithms","Computer displays","Workstations","Condition monitoring","Visualization","Propagation delay","Asynchronous transfer mode","Computational modeling","Stochastic processes","Concurrent computing"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-3940-7","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1993.398873","title":"Applying observations of work activity in designing prototype data analysis tools","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-3940-7","partnum":"93CH3354-8","rank":55,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livemore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37378533700","id":37378533700,"full_name":"R.R.

Consequently, data analysts often find themselves using tools focused on graphics and programming concepts rather than concepts which reflect their own domain and the context of their work. Some user studies focus on usability tests late in development; others observe work activity, but fail to show how to apply that knowledge in design. This paper describes a methodology for applying observations of data analysis work activity in prototype tool design. The approach can be used both in designing improved data analysis tools, and customizing visualization environments to specific applications. We present an example of user-centered design for a prototype tool to cull large data sets. We revisit the typical graphical approach of animating a large data set from the point of view of an analyst who is culling data. Field evaluations using the prototype tool not only revealed valuable usability information, but initiated in-depth discussions about user's work, tools, technology, and requirements.<>","article_number":"398873","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=398873","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/398873/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/398873/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '93","conference_location":"San Jose, CA, USA","conference_dates":"25-29 Oct. 1993","publication_number":3180,"is_number":9012,"publication_year":1993,"publication_date":"25-29 Oct. 1993","start_page":"228","end_page":"235","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":66,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Prototypes","Data analysis","Usability","Software prototyping","Data visualization","Animation","Design methodology","Software design","Laboratories","Graphics"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-3940-7","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1993.398833","title":"Proceedings Visualization '93","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-3940-7","partnum":"93CH3354-8","rank":56,"authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Presents the front cover of the proceedings record.","article_number":"398833","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=398833","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/398833/","publication_title":"Proceedings Visualization '93","conference_location":"San Jose, CA, USA","conference_dates":"25-29 Oct. 1993","publication_number":3180,"is_number":9012,"publication_year":1993,"publication_date":"25-29 Oct. 1993","start_page":"0_1","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":101,"insert_date":"20020806","index_terms":{},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-3940-7","isbnType":"Historical"}]}}]}
