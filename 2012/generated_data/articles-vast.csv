"Recent research suggests that the personality trait Locus of Control (LOC) can be a reliable predictor of performance when learning a new visualization tool. While these results are compelling and have direct implications to visualization design, the relationship between a user's LOC measure and their performance is not well understood. We hypothesize that there is a dependent relationship between LOC and performance; specifically, a person's orientation on the LOC scale directly influences their performance when learning new visualizations. To test this hypothesis, we conduct an experiment with 300 subjects using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. We adapt techniques from personality psychology to manipulate a user's LOC so that users are either primed to be more internally or externally oriented on the LOC scale. Replicating previous studies investigating the effect of LOC on performance, we measure users' speed and accuracy as they use visualizations with varying visual metaphors. Our findings demonstrate that changing a user's LOC impacts their performance. We find that a change in users' LOC results in performance changes.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400535/","LOCKED","6400535","Tufts University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38513524100","1","Alvitta Ottley","38513524100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Tufts University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38229914800","2","R.

"This poster describes general concepts of integrating the statistical computation package R into a coordinated multiple views framework. The integration is based on a cyclic analysis workflow. In this model, interactive selections are a key aspect to trigger and control computations in R. Dynamic updates of data columns are a generic mechanism to transfer computational results back to the interactive visualization. Further aspects include the integration of the R console and an R object browser as views in our system. We illustrate our approach by means of an interactive modeling process.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400537/","LOCKED","6400537","VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546620000","1","Johannes Kehrer","37546620000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dept. of Statistics and Probability Theory, Vienna University of Technology, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086788302","2","Roland N.

"Cyber physical systems (CPS), such as smart buildings and data centers, are richly instrumented systems composed of tightly coupled computational and physical elements that generate large amounts of data. To explore CPS data and obtain actionable insights, we construct a Radial Pixel Visualization (RPV) system, which uses multiple concentric rings to show the data in a compact circular layout of small polygons (pixel cells), each of which represents an individual data value. RPV provides an effective visual representation of locality and periodicity of the high volume, multivariate data streams, and seamlessly combines them with the results of an automated analysis. In the outermost ring the results of correlation analysis and peak point detection are highlighted. Our explorations demonstrates how RPV can help administrators to identify periodic thermal hot spots, understand data center energy consumption, and optimize IT workload.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400541/","LOCKED","6400541","Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274264300","1","M.

"Mass and social media provide flows of images for real world events. It is sometimes difficult to represent realities and impressions of events using only text. However, even a single photo might remind us complex events. Along with events in the real world, there are representative images, such as design of products and commercial pictures. We can therefore recognize changes in trends of people's ideas, experiences, and interests through observing the flows of such representative images. This paper presents a novel 3D visualization system to explore temporal changes in trends using images associating with different topics, called Image Bricks. We show case studies using images extracted from our six-year blog archive. We first extract clusters of images as topics related to given keywords. We then visualize them on multiple timelines in a 3D space. Users can visually read stories of topics through exploring visualized images.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400539/","LOCKED","6400539","Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37534010200","1","Masahiko Itoh","37534010200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37328454400","2","Masashi Toyoda","37328454400","Rakuten, Inc.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086712950","3","Tetsuya Kamijo","37086712950","Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283954000","4","Masaru Kitsuregawa","37283954000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","0","14-19 Oct. 2012","Seattle, WA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2012.6400539","230","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400539/","","","","","","","","Visualization","Market research","Blogs","Media","Timing","Histograms","Feature extraction","6400483","978-1-4673-4752-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4752-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4753-2","12EX7700","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400539","14-19 Oct. 2012","6381601","2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2012","IEEE","5","229","Visualizing flows of images in social media"
"We introduce translational science, a research discipline from medicine, and show how adapting it for visual analytics can improve the design and evaluation of visual analytics interfaces. Translational science “translates” knowledge from the lab to the real-world to “ground truth” by incorporating a 3 phase program of research. Phase 1 & 2 include protocols for research in the lab and field and Phase 3 focuses on dissemination and documentation. We discuss these phases and how they may be applied to visual analytics research.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400543/","LOCKED","6400543","School of Interactive Arts + Science, Simon Fraser University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403562900","1","Tera Marie Green","37403562900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","School of Interactive Arts + Science, Simon Fraser University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267458000","2","Brian Fisher","37267458000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","0","14-19 Oct. 2012","Seattle, WA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2012.6400543","222","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400543/","cognition","evaluation","experimental studies","","","","","Visual analytics","Laboratories","Cognition","Protocols","Best practices","Educational institutions","","6400483","978-1-4673-4752-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4752-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4753-2","12EX7700","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400543","14-19 Oct. 2012","6381601","2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2012","IEEE","6","221","Using translational science in visual analytics"

"We present an extended version of targeted projection pursuit, a high dimensional data exploration tool adapted for producing graph layouts using node-attributes. Attributes are generated based on detected events in the intrusion detection system and firewall logs and how often they occur for each IP address. Edges are the directed links between source and destination IPs. The layout is interactive and users can manipulate the points in order to find interesting layouts and then further analyse how these layouts are related to the events in the logs. Thus, they first allow the user to detect anomalies and then gives them a platform to investigate why they occur.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400510/","LOCKED","6400510","Northumbria University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37903948900","1","Helen Gibson","37903948900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Northumbria University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38197736500","2","Paul Vickers","38197736500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","1","14-19 Oct. 2012","Seattle, WA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2012.6400510","294","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400510/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6400483","978-1-4673-4752-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4752-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4753-2","12EX7700","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400510","14-19 Oct. 2012","6381601","2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2012","IEEE","8","293","Network infrastructure visualisation using high-dimensional node-attribute data"
"There is limited understanding of the relationship between neighbourhoods, demographic characteristics and domestic energy consumption habits. We report upon research that combines datasets relating to household energy use with geodemographics to enable better understanding of UK energy user types. A novel interactive interface is planned to evaluate the performance of specifically created energy-based data classifications. The research aims to help local governments and the energy industry in targeting households and populations for new energy saving schemes and in improving efforts to promote sustainable energy consumption. The new classifications may also stimulate consumption awareness amongst domestic users.

"Within the Visual Analytics research agenda there is an interest on studying the applicability of multimodal information representation and interaction techniques for the analytical reasoning process. The present study summarizes a pilot experiment conducted to understand the effects of augmenting visualizations of affectively-charged information using auditory graphs. We designed an audiovisual representation of social comments made to different news posted on a popular website, and their affective dimension using a sentiment analysis tool for short texts. Participants of the study were asked to create an assessment of the affective valence trend (positive or negative) of the news articles using for it, the visualizations and sonifications. The conditions were tested looking for speed/accuracy trade off comparing the visual representation with an audiovisual one. We discuss our preliminary findings regarding the design of augmented information-representation.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400547/","LOCKED","6400547","School of Interactive Arts and Technology Simon Fraser University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085643789","1","Nadya A.

"In recent years, the quantity of time series data generated in a wide variety of domains grown consistently. Thus, it is difficult for analysts to process and understand this overwhelming amount of data. In the specific case of time series data another problem arises: time series can be highly interrelated. This problem becomes even more challenging when a set of parameters influences the progression of a time series. However, while most visual analysis techniques support the analysis of short time periods, e.g. one day or one week, they fail to visualize large-scale time series, ranging over one year or more. In our approach we present a time series matrix visualization that tackles this problem. Its primary advantages are that it scales to a large number of time series with different start and end points and allows for the visual comparison / correlation analysis of a set of influencing factors. To evaluate our approach, we applied our technique to a real-world data set, showing the impact of local weather conditions on the efficiency of photovoltaic power plants.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400549/","LOCKED","6400549","Universität Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38551542600","1","Michael Behrisch","38551542600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Fraunhofer IGD","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37603822500","2","James Davey","37603822500","Universität Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282557600","3","Tobias Schreck","37282557600","Universität Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","4","Daniel Keim","37283138700","Fraunhofer IGD","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37449689200","5","Jörn Kohlhammer","37449689200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3","0","14-19 Oct. 2012","Seattle, WA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2012.6400549","210","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400549/","H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval Design Tools and Techniques]: Information filtering —","","","","","","","Time series analysis","Correlation","Temperature measurement","Meteorology","Substations","Visualization","Power generation","6400483","978-1-4673-4752-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4752-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4753-2","12EX7700","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400549","14-19 Oct. 2012","6381601","2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2012","IEEE","15","209","Matrix-based visual correlation analysis on large timeseries data"

"Visual analysis of time series data is an important, yet challenging task with many application examples in fields such as financial or news stream data analysis. Many visual time series analysis approaches consider a global perspective on the time series. Fewer approaches consider visual analysis of local patterns in time series, and often rely on interactive specification of the local area of interest. We present initial results of an approach that is based on automatic detection of local interest points. We follow an overview-first approach to find useful parameters for the interest point detection, and details-on-demand to relate the found patterns. We present initial results and detail possible extensions of the approach.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400534/","LOCKED","6400534","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282557600","1","Tobias Schreck","37282557600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085758296","2","Lyubka Sharalieva","37085758296","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086732811","3","Franz Wanner","37086732811","Fraunhofer IGD Darmstadt, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606179600","4","Jürgen Bernard","37606179600","Fraunhofer IGD Darmstadt, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593423500","5","Tobias Ruppert","37593423500","TU Darmstadt Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586276100","6","Tatiana von Landesberger","37586276100","Universidad de Chile Santiago de Chile","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138400","7","Benjamin Bustos","37283138400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2","2","14-19 Oct. 2012","Seattle, WA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2012.6400534","240","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400534/","","","","","","","","Time series analysis","Visualization","Data visualization","Detectors","Educational institutions","Shape","Sorting","6400483","978-1-4673-4752-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4752-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4753-2","12EX7700","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400534","14-19 Oct. 2012","6381601","2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2012","IEEE","20","239","Visual exploration of local interest points in sets of time series"
"Event data can hold valuable decision making information, yet detecting interesting patterns in this type of data is not an easy task because the data is usually rich and contains spatial, temporal as well as multivariate dimensions. Research into visual analytics tools to support the discovery of patterns in event data often focuses on the spatiotemporal or spatiomultivariate dimension of the data only. Few research efforts focus on all three dimensions in one framework. An integral view on all three dimensions is, however, required to unlock the full potential of event datasets. In this poster, we present an event visualization, transition, and interaction framework that enables an integral view on all dimensions of spatiotemporal multivariate event data. The framework is built around the notion that the event data space can be considered a spatiotemporal multivariate hypercube. Results of a case study we performed suggest that a visual analytics tool based on the proposed framework is indeed capable to support users in the discovery of multidimensional spatiotemporal multivariate patterns in event data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400536/","LOCKED","6400536","Intelligent Systems Lab Amsterdam, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086738183","1","Fred Olislagers","37086738183","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Intelligent Systems Lab Amsterdam, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267865600","2","Marcel Worring","37267865600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","0","14-19 Oct. 2012","Seattle, WA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2012.6400536","236","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400536/","Coordinated and multiple views","Visual knowledge discovery","Field studies","Multidimensional data","Visual analytics","","","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Data visualization","Visual analytics","Hypercubes","Intelligent systems","Educational institutions","Abstracts","6400483","978-1-4673-4752-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4752-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4753-2","12EX7700","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400536","14-19 Oct. 2012","6381601","2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2012","IEEE","21","235","The spatiotemporal multivariate hypercube for discovery of patterns in event data"
"Existing research suggests that individual personality differences can influence performance with visualizations. In addition to stable traits such as locus of control, research in psychology has found that temporary changes in affect (emotion) can significantly impact individual performance on cognitive tasks. We examine the relationship between fundamental visual judgement tasks and affect through a crowdsourced user study that combines affective-priming techniques from psychology with longstanding graphical perception experiments. Our results suggest that affective-priming can significantly influence accuracy in visual judgements, and that some chart types may be more affected than others.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400540/","LOCKED","6400540","UNC-Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546111900","1","Lane Harrison","37546111900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Tufts University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592409400","2","Remco Chang","37592409400","UNC-Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37545504600","3","Aidong Lu","37545504600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2","0","14-19 Oct. 2012","Seattle, WA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2012.6400540","228","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400540/","","","","","","","","Psychology","Visual analytics","Human factors","Accuracy","Humans","Atmospheric measurements","","6400483","978-1-4673-4752-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4752-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4753-2","12EX7700","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400540","14-19 Oct. 2012","6381601","2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2012","IEEE","22","227","Exploring the impact of emotion on visual judgement"

"Datasets that are collected for research often contain millions of records and may carry hidden pitfalls that are hard to detect. This work demonstrates how visual analytics can be used for identifying problems in the spatial distribution of crawled photographic data in different datasets: Picasa Web Albums, Panoramio, Flickr and Geograph, chosen to be potential data sources for ongoing doctoral research. This poster summary describes a number of problems found in the datasets using visual analytics and suggests that greater attention should be paid to assessing the quality of data gathered from user-generated photographic content. This work is the first part of a three-year PhD project aimed at producing a pedestrian-routing system that can suggest attractive pathways extracted from user-generated photographic content.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400538/","LOCKED","6400538","giCentre, City University London","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077799700","1","Alexander Kachkaev","37077799700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","giCentre, City University London","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399045100","2","Jo Wood","37399045100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","14-19 Oct. 2012","Seattle, WA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2012.6400538","232","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400538/","","","","","","","","Visual analytics","Cities and towns","Educational institutions","User-generated content","Semantics","Electronic mail","USA Councils","6400483","978-1-4673-4752-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4752-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4753-2","12EX7700","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400538","14-19 Oct. 2012","6381601","2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2012","IEEE","24","231","Using visual analytics to detect problems in datasets collected from photo-sharing services"
"In this paper, we present a case study where we incorporate GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selectors) [2] task analysis into the design process of a visual analysis tool. We performed GOMS analysis on an Electroencephalography (EEG) analyst's current data analysis strategy to identify important user tasks and unnecessary user actions in his current workflow. We then designed an EEG data visual analysis tool based on the GOMS analysis result. Evaluation results show that the tool we have developed, EEGVis, allows the user to analyze EEG data with reduced subjective cognitive load, faster speed and increased confidence in the analysis quality. The positive evaluation results suggest that our design process demonstrates an effective application of GOMS analysis to discover opportunities for designing better tools to support the user's visual analysis process.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400542/","LOCKED","6400542","Department of Computer Science Brown University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489241200","1","Hua Guo","38489241200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Department of Computer Science Brown University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086743819","2","Diem Tran","37086743819","Department of Computer Science Brown University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275712600","3","David H.

"Despite the extensive work done in the scientific visualization community on the creation and optimization of spatial data structures, there has been little adaptation of these structures in visual analytics and information visualization. In this work we present how we modify a space-partioning time (SPT) tree - a structure normally used in direct-volume rendering - for geospatial-temporal visualizations. We also present optimization techniques to improve the traversal speed of our structure through locational codes and bitwise comparisons. Finally, we present the results of an experiment that quantitatively evaluates our modified SPT tree with and without our optimizations. Our results indicate that retrieval was nearly three times faster when using our optimizations, and are consistent across multiple trials. Our finding could have implications for performance in using our modified SPT tree in large-scale geospatial temporal visual analytics software.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400544/","LOCKED","6400544","Department of Computer Science Brown University & Tufts University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38488457200","1","Connor Gramazio","38488457200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Department of Computer Science, Tufts University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592409400","2","Remco Chang","37592409400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","14-19 Oct. 2012","Seattle, WA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2012.6400544","220","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400544/","","","","","","","","Optimization","Data visualization","Geospatial analysis","Visual analytics","Indexing","Communities","Octrees","6400483","978-1-4673-4752-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4752-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4753-2","12EX7700","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400544","14-19 Oct. 2012","6381601","2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2012","IEEE","27","219","Optimizing an SPT-tree for visual analytics"

"In this VAST challenge, log data coming from locations all over the Bank of Money facilities that contains close one million IP addresses. Since the geography of the data plays an important role for potential anomalies detection, we present a particular visualization solution based on Google Earth that can provide measure and deal with geo-spatial data. By mapping three important attributes, i.e., number of connections, policy status and activity flag, into 3D bars on top of physical locations (coordinates), anomaly distribution and trends can be efficiently visualized and analyzed. The general KML file generator can be extended for further analysis on other GIS systems.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400511/","LOCKED","6400511","Central Michigan University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37075025100","1","Tao Zhang","37075025100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Central Michigan University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37075401000","2","Qi Liao","37075401000","Chinese Academy of Sciences","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085394737","3","Lei Shi","37085394737","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","14-19 Oct. 2012","Seattle, WA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2012.6400511","292","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400511/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6400483","978-1-4673-4752-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4752-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4753-2","12EX7700","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400511","14-19 Oct. 2012","6381601","2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2012","IEEE","29","291","3D anomaly bar visualization for large-scale network: VAST 2012 Mini Challenge #1"
"Temporal awareness is pivotal to successful real-time dynamic decision making in a wide range of command and control situations; particularly in safety-critical environments. However, little explicit support for operators' temporal awareness is provided by decision support systems (DSS) for time-critical decisions. In the context of functional simulations of naval anti-air warfare and emergency response management, the present study compares operator support provided by two display formats. In both environments, we contrast a baseline condition to a condition in which a temporal display was integrated to the original interface to support operators' temporal awareness. We also wish to establish whether the implementation of time-based DSSs may also come with drawbacks on cognitive functioning and performance.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400546/","LOCKED","6400546","Université Laval","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086100792","1","Cindy Chamberland","37086100792","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Université Laval","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37424677100","2","François Vachon","37424677100","Université Laval","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38332215800","3","Jean-François Gagnon","38332215800","Looking Glass HF, Inc.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37061073800","4","Simon Banbury","37061073800","Université Laval","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295580300","5","Sébastien Tremblay","37295580300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","14-19 Oct. 2012","Seattle, WA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2012.6400546","216","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400546/","Temporal awareness","time management","decision support","human factors","","","","Decision support systems","Decision making","Electronic mail","Command and control systems","Fires","Real-time systems","Marine vehicles","6400483","978-1-4673-4752-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4752-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4753-2","12EX7700","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400546","14-19 Oct. 2012","6381601","2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2012","IEEE","30","215","Time-oriented visualization and anticipation"
"Existing research into cycling behaviours has either relied on detailed ethnographic studies or larger public attitude surveys [1] [9]. Instead, following recent contributions from information visualization [13] and data mining [5] [7], this design study uses visual analytics techniques to identify, describe and explain cycling behaviours within a large and attribute rich transactional dataset. Using data from London's bike share scheme1, customer level classifications will be created, which consider the regularity of scheme use, journey length and travel times. Monitoring customer usage over time, user classifications will attend to the dynamics of cycling behaviour, asking substantive questions about how behaviours change under varying conditions. The 3-year PhD project will contribute to academic and strategic discussions around sustainable travel policy. A programme of research is outlined, along with an early visual analytics prototype for rapidly querying customer journeys.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400550/","LOCKED","6400550","City University London","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085483305","1","Roger Beecham","37085483305","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","City University London","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399045100","2","Jo Wood","37399045100","Transport for London","","3","Audrey Bowerman","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","0","14-19 Oct. 2012","Seattle, WA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2012.6400550","208","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400550/","","","","","","","","Radio frequency","Visual analytics","Computer interfaces","Educational institutions","Cities and towns","Prototypes","Context","6400483","978-1-4673-4752-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4752-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4753-2","12EX7700","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400550","14-19 Oct. 2012","6381601","2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2012","IEEE","31","207","A visual analytics approach to understanding cycling behaviour"

"We present an analytics-based framework for simultaneous visualization of large surface data collections arising in clinical neuroimaging studies. Termed Informatics Visualization for Neuroimaging (INVIZIAN), this framework allows the visualization of both cortical surfaces characteristics and feature relatedness in unison. It also uses dimension reduction methods to derive new coordinate systems using a Jensen-Shannon divergence metric for positioning cortical surfaces in a metric space such that the proximity in location is proportional to neuroanatomical similarity. Feature data such as thickness and volume are colored on the cortical surfaces and used to display both subject-specific feature values and global trends within the population. Additionally, a query-based framework allows the neuroscience researcher to investigate probable correlations between neuroanatomical and subject patient attribute values such as age and diagnosis.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400548/","LOCKED","6400548","Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles 90095","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37603001800","1","Ian Bowman","37603001800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles 90095","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37288595800","2","Shantanu H.

"Data quality evaluation is one of the most critical steps during the data mining processes. Data with poor quality often leads to poor performance in data mining, low efficiency in data analysis, wrong decision which bring great economic loss to users and organizations further. Although many researches have been carried out from various aspects of the extracting, transforming, and loading processes in data mining, most researches pay more attention to analysis automation than to data quality evaluation. To address the data quality evaluation issues, we propose an approach to combine human beings' powerful cognitive abilities in data quality evaluation with the high efficiency ability of computer, and develop a visual analysis method for data quality evaluation based on visual morphology.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400531/","LOCKED","6400531","Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37553445200","1","Dongxing Teng","37553445200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37596723800","2","Haiyan Yang","37596723800","Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279749200","3","Cuixia Ma","37279749200","Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086716757","4","Hongan Wang","37086716757","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","14-19 Oct. 2012","Seattle, WA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2012.6400531","246","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400531/","Visual Analysis","Interactive Visualization","Database Quality","","","","","Visualization","Visual databases","Data visualization","Data mining","Morphology","Data analysis","","6400483","978-1-4673-4752-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4752-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4753-2","12EX7700","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400531","14-19 Oct. 2012","6381601","2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2012","IEEE","35","245","VDQAM: A toolkit for database quality evaluation based on visual morphology"

"We focus on visual analysis of space- and time-referenced categorical data, which describe possible states of spatial (geographical) objects or locations and their changes over time. The analysis of these data is difficult as there are only limited possibilities to analyze the three aspects (location, time and category) simultaneously. We present a new approach which interactively combines (a) visualization of categorical changes over time; (b) various spatial data displays; (c) computational techniques for task-oriented selection of time steps. They provide an expressive visualization with regard to either the overall evolution over time or unusual changes. We apply our approach on two use cases demonstrating its usefulness for a wide variety of tasks. We analyze data from movement tracking and meteorologic areas. Using our approach, expected events could be detected and new insights were gained.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400553/","LOCKED","6400553","TU Darmstadt Darmstadt, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586276100","1","T. von Landesberger","37586276100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TU Darmstadt Darmstadt, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586274500","2","Sebastian Bremm","37586274500","Fraunhofer IAIS Bonn, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047700","3","Natalia Andrienko","37283047700","Fraunhofer IAIS Bonn, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047100","4","Gennady Andrienko","37283047100","SHMU Bratislava, Slovakia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086762292","5","Mária Tekušová","37086762292","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","26","0","14-19 Oct. 2012","Seattle, WA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2012.6400553","192","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400553/","","","","","","","","Data visualization","Visualization","Algorithm design and analysis","Image color analysis","Time series analysis","Electronic mail","Data analysis","6400483","978-1-4673-4752-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4752-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4753-2","12EX7700","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400553","14-19 Oct. 2012","6381601","2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2012","IEEE","37","183","Visual analytics methods for categoric spatio-temporal data"

Of these, not each might be applicable to the data at hand or might reveal the desired result. Owing to this, innovations may be used inappropriately and users may become skeptical. In this paper we propose a knowledge-assisted interface for medical visualization, which reduces the necessary effort to use new visualization methods, by providing only the most relevant ones in a smart way. Consequently, we are able to expand such a system with innovations without the users to worry about when, where, and especially how they may or should use them.

"The world's corpora of data grow in size and complexity every day, making it increasingly difficult for experts to make sense out of their data. Although machine learning offers algorithms for finding patterns in data automatically, they often require algorithm-specific parameters, such as an appropriate distance function, which are outside the purview of a domain expert. We present a system that allows an expert to interact directly with a visual representation of the data to define an appropriate distance function, thus avoiding direct manipulation of obtuse model parameters. Adopting an iterative approach, our system first assumes a uniformly weighted Euclidean distance function and projects the data into a two-dimensional scatterplot view. The user can then move incorrectly-positioned data points to locations that reflect his or her understanding of the similarity of those data points relative to the other data points. Based on this input, the system performs an optimization to learn a new distance function and then re-projects the data to redraw the scatter-plot. We illustrate empirically that with only a few iterations of interaction and optimization, a user can achieve a scatterplot view and its corresponding distance function that reflect the user's knowledge of the data. In addition, we evaluate our system to assess scalability in data size and data dimension, and show that our system is computationally efficient and can provide an interactive or near-interactive user experience.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400486/","LOCKED","6400486","Department of Computer Science Tufts University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38237586900","1","Eli T.

"An essential element of exploratory data analysis is the use of revealing low-dimensional projections of high-dimensional data. Projection Pursuit has been an effective method for finding interesting low-dimensional projections of multidimensional spaces by optimizing a score function called a projection pursuit index. However, the technique is not scalable to high-dimensional spaces. Here, we introduce a novel method for discovering noteworthy views of high-dimensional data spaces by using binning and random projections. We define score functions, akin to projection pursuit indices, that characterize visual patterns of the low-dimensional projections that constitute feature subspaces. We also describe an analytic, multivariate visualization platform based on this algorithm that is scalable to extremely large problems.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400490/","LOCKED","6400490","Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Chicago","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37548165700","1","Anushka Anand","37548165700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Chicago","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37560536200","2","Leland Wilkinson","37560536200","Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Chicago","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606167900","3","Tuan Nhon Dang","37606167900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","16","0","14-19 Oct. 2012","Seattle, WA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2012.6400490","52","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400490/","Random Projections","High-dimensional Data","","","","","","Vectors","Data visualization","Data mining","Manifolds","Indexes","Visual analytics","","6400483","978-1-4673-4752-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4752-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4753-2","12EX7700","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400490","14-19 Oct. 2012","6381601","2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2012","IEEE","41","43","Visual pattern discovery using random projections"
"Recent advances in technology have enabled social media services to support space-time indexed data, and internet users from all over the world have created a large volume of time-stamped, geo-located data. Such spatiotemporal data has immense value for increasing situational awareness of local events, providing insights for investigations and understanding the extent of incidents, their severity, and consequences, as well as their time-evolving nature. In analyzing social media data, researchers have mainly focused on finding temporal trends according to volume-based importance. Hence, a relatively small volume of relevant messages may easily be obscured by a huge data set indicating normal situations. In this paper, we present a visual analytics approach that provides users with scalable and interactive social media data analysis and visualization including the exploration and examination of abnormal topics and events within various social media data sources, such as Twitter, Flickr and YouTube. In order to find and understand abnormal events, the analyst can first extract major topics from a set of selected messages and rank them probabilistically using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. He can then apply seasonal trend decomposition together with traditional control chart methods to find unusual peaks and outliers within topic time series. Our case studies show that situational awareness can be improved by incorporating the anomaly and trend examination techniques into a highly interactive visual analysis process.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400557/","LOCKED","6400557","Purdue University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086784736","1","Junghoon Chae","37086784736","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Stuttgart","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233559700","2","Dennis Thom","38233559700","University of Stuttgart","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37683989300","3","Harald Bosch","37683989300","Sejong University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37557344300","4","Yun Jang","37557344300","Arizona State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396008400","5","Ross Maciejewski","37396008400","Purdue University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282598900","6","David S.

"In explorative data analysis, the data under consideration often resides in a high-dimensional (HD) data space. Currently many methods are available to analyze this type of data. So far, proposed automatic approaches include dimensionality reduction and cluster analysis, whereby visual-interactive methods aim to provide effective visual mappings to show, relate, and navigate HD data. Furthermore, almost all of these methods conduct the analysis from a singular perspective, meaning that they consider the data in either the original HD data space, or a reduced version thereof. Additionally, HD data spaces often consist of combined features that measure different properties, in which case the particular relationships between the various properties may not be clear to the analysts a priori since it can only be revealed if appropriate feature combinations (subspaces) of the data are taken into consideration. Considering just a single subspace is, however, often not sufficient since different subspaces may show complementary, conjointly, or contradicting relations between data items. Useful information may consequently remain embedded in sets of subspaces of a given HD input data space. Relying on the notion of subspaces, we propose a novel method for the visual analysis of HD data in which we employ an interestingness-guided subspace search algorithm to detect a candidate set of subspaces. Based on appropriately defined subspace similarity functions, we visualize the subspaces and provide navigation facilities to interactively explore large sets of subspaces. Our approach allows users to effectively compare and relate subspaces with respect to involved dimensions and clusters of objects. We apply our approach to synthetic and real data sets. We thereby demonstrate its support for understanding HD data from different perspectives, effectively yielding a more complete view on HD data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400488/","LOCKED","6400488","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590724000","1","Andrada Tatu","37590724000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Konstanz, Germany","","2","Fabian Maaß","","RWTH Aachen University Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37992807400","3","Ines Färber","37992807400","University of Konstanz, Germany","","4","Enrico Bertini","","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282557600","5","Tobias Schreck","37282557600","RWTH Aachen University Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283129200","6","Thomas Seidl","37283129200","University of Konstanz Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","7","Daniel Keim","37283138700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","41","0","14-19 Oct. 2012","Seattle, WA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2012.6400488","72","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400488/","H.2.8 [Database Applications]: Data mining","H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: Selection process","I.3.3 [Picture/Image Generation]","Display algorithms","","","","High definition video","Algorithm design and analysis","Visualization","Clustering algorithms","Topology","Data visualization","Educational institutions","6400483","978-1-4673-4752-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4752-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4753-2","12EX7700","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400488","14-19 Oct. 2012","6381601","2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2012","IEEE","43","63","Subspace search and visualization to make sense of alternative clusterings in high-dimensional data"
"Learning of classifiers to be used as filters within the analytical reasoning process leads to new and aggravates existing challenges. Such classifiers are typically trained ad-hoc, with tight time constraints that affect the amount and the quality of annotation data and, thus, also the users' trust in the classifier trained. We approach the challenges of ad-hoc training by inter-active learning, which extends active learning by integrating human experts' background knowledge to greater extent. In contrast to active learning, not only does inter-active learning include the users' expertise by posing queries of data instances for labeling, but it also supports the users in comprehending the classifier model by visualization. Besides the annotation of manually or automatically selected data instances, users are empowered to directly adjust complex classifier models. Therefore, our model visualization facilitates the detection and correction of inconsistencies between the classifier model trained by examples and the user's mental model of the class definition. Visual feedback of the training process helps the users assess the performance of the classifier and, thus, build up trust in the filter created. We demonstrate the capabilities of inter-active learning in the domain of video visual analytics and compare its performance with the results of random sampling and uncertainty sampling of training sets.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400492/","LOCKED","6400492","Institute of Cognitive Science, University of Osnabrück","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37571601300","1","Benjamin Höferlin","37571601300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Visualization Research Center (VISUS), University of Stuttgart","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085504694","2","Rudolf Netzel","37085504694","Visualization Research Center (VISUS), University of Stuttgart","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37680797500","3","Markus Höferlin","37680797500","Visualization Research Center (VISUS), University of Stuttgart","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268045000","4","Daniel Weiskopf","37268045000","Institute of Cognitive Science, University of Osnabrück","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266102100","5","Gunther Heidemann","37266102100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","18","1","14-19 Oct. 2012","Seattle, WA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2012.6400492","32","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400492/","H.3.3 [Information Systems]: Information Storage and Retrieval — Information Search and Retrieval","I.2.6 [Computing Methodologies]: Artificial Intelligence — Learning","","","","","","Training","Data models","Visual analytics","Humans","Data visualization","Labeling","Analytical models","6400483","978-1-4673-4752-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4752-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4753-2","12EX7700","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400492","14-19 Oct. 2012","6381601","2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2012","IEEE","44","23","Inter-active learning of ad-hoc classifiers for video visual analytics"
"Distributed cognition and embodiment provide compelling models for how humans think and interact with the environment. Our examination of the use of large, high-resolution displays from an embodied perspective has lead directly to the development of a new sensemaking environment called Analyst's Workspace (AW). AW leverages the embodied resources made more accessible through the physical nature of the display to create a spatial workspace. By combining spatial layout of documents and other artifacts with an entity-centric, explorative investigative approach, AW aims to allow the analyst to externalize elements of the sensemaking process as a part of the investigation, integrated into the visual representations of the data itself. In this paper, we describe the various capabilities of AW and discuss the key principles and concepts underlying its design, emphasizing unique design principles for designing visual analytic tools for large, high-resolution displays.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400559/","LOCKED","6400559","Virginia Tech","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37587847300","1","Christopher Andrews","37587847300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Virginia Tech","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37419565900","2","Chris North","37419565900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","31","1","14-19 Oct. 2012","Seattle, WA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2012.6400559","131","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400559/","Embodiment","distributed cognition","large","highresolution display","sensemaking","space","","Cognition","Visualization","Humans","Navigation","Organizations","Monitoring","Keyboards","6400483","978-1-4673-4752-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4752-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4753-2","12EX7700","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400559","14-19 Oct. 2012","6381601","2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2012","IEEE","45","123","Analyst's Workspace: An embodied sensemaking environment for large, high-resolution displays"
"Web clickstream data are routinely collected to study how users browse the web or use a service. It is clear that the ability to recognize and summarize user behavior patterns from such data is valuable to e-commerce companies. In this paper, we introduce a visual analytics system to explore the various user behavior patterns reflected by distinct clickstream clusters. In a practical analysis scenario, the system first presents an overview of clickstream clusters using a Self-Organizing Map with Markov chain models. Then the analyst can interactively explore the clusters through an intuitive user interface. He can either obtain summarization of a selected group of data or further refine the clustering result. We evaluated our system using two different datasets from eBay. Analysts who were working on the same data have confirmed the system's effectiveness in extracting user behavior patterns from complex datasets and enhancing their ability to reason.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400494/","LOCKED","6400494","University of California, Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37404768800","1","Jishang Wei","37404768800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eBay Research Labs","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37852129700","2","Zeqian Shen","37852129700","eBay Research Labs","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37845570000","3","Neel Sundaresan","37845570000","University of California, Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275869400","4","Kwan-Liu Ma","37275869400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","39","2","14-19 Oct. 2012","Seattle, WA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2012.6400494","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400494/","","","","","","","","Data visualization","Visualization","Markov processes","Data models","Hidden Markov models","Prototypes","Layout","6400483","978-1-4673-4752-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4752-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4753-2","12EX7700","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400494","14-19 Oct. 2012","6381601","2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2012","IEEE","46","3","Visual cluster exploration of web clickstream data"
"Visualizations embody design choices about data access, data transformation, visual representation, and interaction. To interpret a static visualization, a person must identify the correspondences between the visual representation and the underlying data. These correspondences become moving targets when a visualization is dynamic. Dynamics may be introduced in a visualization at any point in the analysis and visualization process. For example, the data itself may be streaming, shifting subsets may be selected, visual representations may be animated, and interaction may modify presentation. In this paper, we focus on the impact of dynamic data. We present a taxonomy and conceptual framework for understanding how data changes influence the interpretability of visual representations. Visualization techniques are organized into categories at various levels of abstraction. The salient characteristics of each category and task suitability are discussed through examples from the scientific literature and popular practices. Examining the implications of dynamically updating visualizations warrants attention because it directly impacts the interpretability (and thus utility) of visualizations. The taxonomy presented provides a reference point for further exploration of dynamic data visualization techniques.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400552/","LOCKED","6400552","Indiana University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546825800","1","Joseph A.

"Visual analytics (VA) system development started in academic research institutions where novel visualization techniques and open source toolkits were developed. Simultaneously, small software companies, sometimes spin-offs from academic research institutions, built solutions for specific application domains. In recent years we observed the following trend: some small VA companies grew exponentially; at the same time some big software vendors such as IBM and SAP started to acquire successful VA companies and integrated the acquired VA components into their existing frameworks. Generally the application domains of VA systems have broadened substantially. This phenomenon is driven by the generation of more and more data of high volume and complexity, which leads to an increasing demand for VA solutions from many application domains. In this paper we survey a selection of state-of-the-art commercial VA frameworks, complementary to an existing survey on open source VA tools. From the survey results we identify several improvement opportunities as future research directions.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400554/","LOCKED","6400554","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406066900","1","Leishi Zhang","37406066900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592880100","2","Andreas Stoffel","37592880100","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38551542600","3","Michael Behrisch","38551542600","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38579710900","4","Sebastian Mittelstadt","38579710900","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282557600","5","Tobias Schreck","37282557600","Siemens AG","","6","René Pompl","","Siemens AG","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086725010","7","Stefan Weber","37086725010","Siemens AG","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086727068","8","Holger Last","37086727068","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","9","Daniel Keim","37283138700","","","","","","61","0","14-19 Oct. 2012","Seattle, WA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2012.6400554","182","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400554/","H.4 [Information Systems]: INFORMATION SYSTEMS APPLICATIONS","K.1 [Computing Milieux]","THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY — Markets","","","","","Data visualization","Bismuth","Data models","Software","Data handling","Analytical models","Visual analytics","6400483","978-1-4673-4752-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4752-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4753-2","12EX7700","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400554","14-19 Oct. 2012","6381601","2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2012","IEEE","48","173","Visual analytics for the big data era — A comparative review of state-of-the-art commercial systems"
"Text data such as online news and microblogs bear valuable insights regarding important events and responses to such events. Events are inherently temporal, evolving over time. Existing visual text analysis systems have provided temporal views of changes based on topical themes extracted from text data. But few have associated topical themes with events that cause the changes. In this paper, we propose an interactive visual analytics system, LeadLine, to automatically identify meaningful events in news and social media data and support exploration of the events. To characterize events, LeadLine integrates topic modeling, event detection, and named entity recognition techniques to automatically extract information regarding the investigative 4 Ws: who, what, when, and where for each event. To further support analysis of the text corpora through events, LeadLine allows users to interactively examine meaningful events using the 4 Ws to develop an understanding of how and why. Through representing large-scale text corpora in the form of meaningful events, LeadLine provides a concise summary of the corpora. LeadLine also supports the construction of simple narratives through the exploration of events. To demonstrate the efficacy of LeadLine in identifying events and supporting exploration, two case studies were conducted using news and social media data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400485/","LOCKED","6400485","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606064200","1","Wenwen Dou","37606064200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085714260","2","Xiaoyu Wang","37085714260","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086757018","3","Drew Skau","37086757018","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300425000","4","William Ribarsky","37300425000","IBM Almaden Research Center","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086755474","5","Michelle X.

"In the surveillance of road tunnels, video data plays an important role for a detailed inspection and as an input to systems for an automated detection of incidents. In disaster scenarios like major accidents, however, the increased amount of detected incidents may lead to situations where human operators lose a sense of the overall meaning of that data, a problem commonly known as a lack of situation awareness. The primary contribution of this paper is a design study of AlVis, a system designed to increase situation awareness in the surveillance of road tunnels. The design of AlVis is based on a simplified tunnel model which enables an overview of the spatiotemporal development of scenarios in real-time. The visualization explicitly represents the present state, the history, and predictions of potential future developments. Concepts for situation-sensitive prioritization of information ensure scalability from normal operation to major disaster scenarios. The visualization enables an intuitive access to live and historic video for any point in time and space. We illustrate AlVis by means of a scenario and report qualitative feedback by tunnel experts and operators. This feedback suggests that AlVis is suitable to save time in recognizing dangerous situations and helps to maintain an overview in complex disaster scenarios.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400556/","LOCKED","6400556","VRVis Research Center","","1","Harald Piringer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","VRVis Research Center","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233558900","2","Matthias Buchetics","38233558900","Kapsch TrafficCom AG","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086762702","3","Rudolf Benedik","37086762702","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","14","0","14-19 Oct. 2012","Seattle, WA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2012.6400556","162","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400556/","K.6.1 [Management of Computing and Information Systems]","Project and People Management—Life Cycle","","","","","","Surveillance","Cameras","Visualization","Roads","Context","Vehicles","Data visualization","6400483","978-1-4673-4752-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4752-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4753-2","12EX7700","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400556","14-19 Oct. 2012","6381601","2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2012","IEEE","50","153","AlVis: Situation awareness in the surveillance of road tunnels"
"Reconstruction of shredded documents remains a significant challenge. Creating a better document reconstruction system enables not just recovery of information accidentally lost but also understanding our limitations against adversaries' attempts to gain access to information. Existing approaches to reconstructing shredded documents adopt either a predominantly manual (e.g., crowd-sourcing) or a near automatic approach. We describe Deshredder, a visual analytic approach that scales well and effectively incorporates user input to direct the reconstruction process. Deshredder represents shredded pieces as time series and uses nearest neighbor matching techniques that enable matching both the contours of shredded pieces as well as the content of shreds themselves. More importantly, Deshred-der's interface support visual analytics through user interaction with similarity matrices as well as higher level assembly through more complex stitching functions. We identify a functional task taxonomy leading to design considerations for constructing deshredding solutions, and describe how Deshredder applies to problems from the DARPA Shredder Challenge through expert evaluations.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400560/","LOCKED","6400560","Department of Computer Science and Discovery Analytics Center, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38092016400","1","Patrick Butler","38092016400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Department of Computer Science and Discovery Analytics Center, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085644832","2","Prithwish Chakraborty","37085644832","Department of Computer Science and Discovery Analytics Center, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086711720","3","Naren Ramakrishan","37086711720","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","16","0","14-19 Oct. 2012","Seattle, WA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2012.6400560","122","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400560/","I.7.5 [Document and Text Processing]: Document Capture — Graphics recognition and interpretation","I.4.7 [Image Processing and Computer Vistion]: Feature Representation —","H.5 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: User Interfaces — Graphical","","","","","Time series analysis","Image reconstruction","Visual analytics","Assembly","Shape","Humans","","6400483","978-1-4673-4752-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4752-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4753-2","12EX7700","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400560","14-19 Oct. 2012","6381601","2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2012","IEEE","51","113","The Deshredder: A visual analytic approach to reconstructing shredded documents"
"We introduce the concept of just-in-time descriptive analytics as a novel application of computational and statistical techniques performed at interaction-time to help users easily understand the structure of data as seen in visualizations. Fundamental to just-intime descriptive analytics is (a) identifying visual features, such as clusters, outliers, and trends, user might observe in visualizations automatically, (b) determining the semantics of such features by performing statistical analysis as the user is interacting, and (c) enriching visualizations with annotations that not only describe semantics of visual features but also facilitate interaction to support high-level understanding of data. In this paper, we demonstrate just-in-time descriptive analytics applied to a point-based multi-dimensional visualization technique to identify and describe clusters, outliers, and trends. We argue that it provides a novel user experience of computational techniques working alongside of users allowing them to build faster qualitative mental models of data by demonstrating its application on a few use-cases. Techniques used to facilitate just-in-time descriptive analytics are described in detail along with their runtime performance characteristics. We believe this is just a starting point and much remains to be researched, as we discuss open issues and opportunities in improving accessibility and collaboration.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400487/","LOCKED","6400487","IBM Center for Advanced Visualization, IBM Research","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37269701600","1","Eser Kandogan","37269701600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","34","0","14-19 Oct. 2012","Seattle, WA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2012.6400487","82","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400487/","Just-in-time descriptive analytics","feature identification and characterization","point-based visualizations","","","","","Data visualization","Market research","Semantics","Feature extraction","Visualization","Clustering algorithms","Data mining","6400483","978-1-4673-4752-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4752-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4753-2","12EX7700","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400487","14-19 Oct. 2012","6381601","2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2012","IEEE","52","73","Just-in-time annotation of clusters, outliers, and trends in point-based data visualizations"

"Increasingly, social network datasets contain social attribute information about actors and their relationship. Analyzing such network with social attributes requires making sense of not only its structural features, but also the relationship between social features in attributes and network structures. Existing social network analysis tools are usually weak in supporting complex analytical tasks involving both structural and social features, and often overlook users' needs for sensemaking tools that help to gather, synthesize, and organize information of these features. To address these challenges, we propose a sensemaking framework of social-network visual analytics in this paper. This framework considers both bottom-up processes, which are about constructing new understandings based on collected information, and top-down processes, which concern using prior knowledge to guide information collection, in analyzing social networks from both social and structural perspectives. The framework also emphasizes the externalization of sensemaking processes through interactive visualization. Guided by the framework, we develop a system, SocialNetSense, to support the sensemaking in visual analytics of social networks with social attributes.

"Ever improving computing power and technological advances are greatly augmenting data collection and scientific observation. This has directly contributed to increased data complexity and dimensionality, motivating research of exploration techniques for multidimensional data. Consequently, a recent influx of work dedicated to techniques and tools that aid in understanding multidimensional datasets can be observed in many research fields, including biology, engineering, physics and scientific computing. While the effectiveness of existing techniques to analyze the structure and relationships of multidimensional data varies greatly, few techniques provide flexible mechanisms to simultaneously visualize and actively explore high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we present an inverse linear affine multidimensional projection, coined iLAMP, that enables a novel interactive exploration technique for multidimensional data. iLAMP operates in reverse to traditional projection methods by mapping low-dimensional information into a high-dimensional space. This allows users to extrapolate instances of a multidimensional dataset while exploring a projection of the data to the planar domain. We present experimental results that validate iLAMP, measuring the quality and coherence of the extrapolated data; as well as demonstrate the utility of iLAMP to hypothesize the unexplored regions of a high-dimensional space.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400489/","LOCKED","6400489","University of Calgary","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086772630","1","Elisa Portes dos Santos Amorim","37086772630","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Calgary","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37829425000","2","Emilio Vital Brazil","37829425000","NYU Polytechnic Institute","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37602531100","3","Joel Daniels","37602531100","University of Sao Paulo","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017343000","4","Paulo Joia","38017343000","University of Sao Paulo","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590974800","5","Luis Gustavo Nonato","37590974800","University of Calgary","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267488200","6","Mario Costa Sousa","37267488200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","9","0","14-19 Oct. 2012","Seattle, WA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2012.6400489","62","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400489/","","","","","","","","Data visualization","Visualization","Vectors","Space exploration","Optimization","Measurement","Robustness","6400483","978-1-4673-4752-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4752-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4753-2","12EX7700","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400489","14-19 Oct. 2012","6381601","2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2012","IEEE","55","53","iLAMP: Exploring high-dimensional spacing through backward multidimensional projection"
"For a user to perceive continuous interactive response time in a visualization tool, the rule of thumb is that it must process, deliver, and display rendered results for any given interaction in under 100 milliseconds. In many visualization systems, successive interactions trigger independent queries and caching of results. Consequently, computationally expensive queries like multidimensional clustering cannot keep up with rapid sequences of interactions, precluding visual benefits such as motion parallax. In this paper, we describe a heuristic prefetching technique to improve the interactive response time of KMeans clustering in dynamic query visualizations of multidimensional data. We address the tradeoff between high interaction and intense query computation by observing how related interactions on overlapping data subsets produce similar clustering results, and characterizing these similarities within a parameter space of interaction. We focus on the two-dimensional parameter space defined by the minimum and maximum values of a time range manipulated by dragging and stretching a one-dimensional filtering lens over a plot of time series data. Using calculation of nearest neighbors of interaction points in parameter space, we reuse partial query results from prior interaction sequences to calculate both an immediate best-effort clustering result and to schedule calculation of an exact result. The method adapts to user interaction patterns in the parameter space by reprioritizing the interaction neighbors of visited points in the parameter space. A performance study on Mesonet meteorological data demonstrates that the method is a significant improvement over the baseline scheme in which interaction triggers on-demand, exact-range clustering with LRU caching. We also present initial evidence that approximate, temporary clustering results are sufficiently accurate (compared to exact results) to convey useful cluster structure during rapid and protracted interaction.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400493/","LOCKED","6400493","School of Computer Science and Center for Spatial Analysis The University of Oklahoma","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086766962","1","Zafar Ahmed","37086766962","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","School of Computer Science and Center for Spatial Analysis The University of Oklahoma","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564883300","2","Chris Weaver","37564883300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5","0","14-19 Oct. 2012","Seattle, WA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2012.6400493","22","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400493/","D.2.2 [Software Engineering]: Design Tools and Techniques — [User Interfaces]","H.2.3 [Information Systems]: Database Management — [Languages]","H.5.2 [Information Systems]: Information Interfaces and Presentation — [User Interfaces]","","","","","Prefetching","Clustering algorithms","Lenses","Data visualization","Visualization","Algorithm design and analysis","Time series analysis","6400483","978-1-4673-4752-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4752-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4753-2","12EX7700","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400493","14-19 Oct. 2012","6381601","2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2012","IEEE","56","13","An adaptive parameter space-filling algorithm for highly interactive cluster exploration"
"The 2012 Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST) Challenge posed two challenge problems for participants to solve using a combination of visual analytics software and their own analytic reasoning abilities. Challenge 1 (C1) involved visualizing the network health of the fictitious Bank of Money to provide situation awareness and identify emerging trends that could signify network issues. Challenge 2 (C2) involved identifying the issues of concern within a region of the Bank of Money network experiencing operational difficulties utilizing the provided network logs. Participants were asked to analyze the data and provide solutions and explanations for both challenges. The data sets were downloaded by nearly 1100 people by the close of submissions. The VAST Challenge received 40 submissions with participants from 12 different countries, and 14 awards were given.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400529/","LOCKED","6400529","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085505404","1","Kristin Cook","37085505404","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Massachusetts Lowell","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37360588500","2","Georges Grinstein","37360588500","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37357067600","3","Mark Whiting","37357067600","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085518782","4","Michael Cooper","37085518782","Air Force Research Laboratory","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37318416900","5","Paul Havig","37318416900","Air Force Research Laboratory","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085508309","6","Kristen Liggett","37085508309","National Security Agency","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085459022","7","Bohdan Nebesh","37085459022","National Security Agency","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085470329","8","Celeste Lyn Paul","37085470329","","","","","","","","","","","12","3","14-19 Oct. 2012","Seattle, WA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2012.6400529","255","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400529/","Visual analytics","human information interaction","sense making","evaluation","metrics","contest","","","","","","","","","6400483","978-1-4673-4752-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4752-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4753-2","12EX7700","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400529","14-19 Oct. 2012","6381601","2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2012","IEEE","57","251","VAST Challenge 2012: Visual analytics for big data"
"The IEEE Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST) Conference continues to develop and grow. Each year brings new researchers to the field and produces important advances in the theory and practice of visual analytics. VAST is now in its seventh year, and it is the third year as an IEEE Conference. The presented work demonstrates significant growth and maturation of the visual analytics community. We received 104 submissions and were able to accept 30 papers into the program. The conference program reflects the breadth of research in the visual analytics community. Paper sessions cover such areas as foundations of the analysis process; tree, network and social network analysis; support for sensemaking and collaborative analysis; visual computational analysis of multivariate data; space and time; and many applications of visual analytics capabilities such as in the biomedical field, risk management, text and document analysis. To select this year's program, an international program committee of 35 experts carefully considered and reviewed the papers through a two-cycle review process instituted this year. Each paper was assigned to a primary and a secondary reviewer from this committee. The primary and secondary reviewers assigned one more tertiary reviewer to each paper so that at least four reviews were provided for all papers. Based on these reviews, the paper chairs selected the papers conditionally first. The primary reviewer had to evaluate the revised papers carefully in the second review cycle. Finally, the paper chairs accepted 30 papers and organized the program sessions. We are grateful to the International Program Committee and the reviewers for their contributions to a successful review process.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400499/","EPHEMERA","6400499","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","14-19 Oct. 2012","Seattle, WA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2012.6400499","1","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400499/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6400483","978-1-4673-4752-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4752-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4753-2","12EX7700","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400499","14-19 Oct. 2012","6381601","2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2012","IEEE","58","1","Preface: Message from the General and Paper Chairs"

"The VAST Challenge 2012 deals with large data network analysis. The challenge scenario is centered around the computer network of the fictitious Bank of Money (BoM). BoM operates 888,977 computers which are geographically distributed on a fictitious landmass. The provided data has a hierarchical structure grouping machines in business units, facilities, machine classes and machine types. For each machine, up to 192 status logs in a two day time period were provided. These logs report on three status attributes: policy, activity and number of connections. The main task of Mini-Challenge 1 was to highlight up to five anomalies in the massive data set. We address this challenge by presenting HIVEBEAT, a highly interactive visualization environment for broad-scale exploratory analysis and tracing. It offers eight interactive views which visualize different aspects of the data, support brushing and linking and are complemented with time-dependent and sequence-based filtering. Some of these components build on ideas from earlier works [2, 3, 4]. With HIVEBEAT, we were able to identify five anomalies and justify them with plausible hypotheses.","","EPHEMERA","6400518","Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems (VIS), Universität Stuttgart, Germany Visualization Research Center Universität Stuttgart (VISUS), Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077786200","1","Robert Krüger","37077786200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems (VIS), Universität Stuttgart, Germany Visualization Research Center Universität Stuttgart (VISUS), Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37683989300","2","Harald Bosch","37683989300","Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems (VIS), Universität Stuttgart, Germany Visualization Research Center Universität Stuttgart (VISUS), Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593029700","3","Steffen Koch","37593029700","Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems (VIS), Universität Stuttgart, Germany Visualization Research Center Universität Stuttgart (VISUS), Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37303115200","4","Christoph Müller","37303115200","Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems (VIS), Universität Stuttgart, Germany Visualization Research Center Universität Stuttgart (VISUS), Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37287276500","5","Guido Reina","37287276500","Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems (VIS), Universität Stuttgart, Germany Visualization Research Center Universität Stuttgart (VISUS), Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233559700","6","Dennis Thom","38233559700","Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems (VIS), Universität Stuttgart, Germany Visualization Research Center Universität Stuttgart (VISUS), Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268023800","7","Thomas Ertl","37268023800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","14-19 Oct. 2012","Seattle, WA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2012.6400518","278","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400518/","H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: User Interfaces — GUI","H.3.3 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Information Search and Retrieval — Search process","","","","","","","","","","","","","6400483","978-1-4673-4752-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4752-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4753-2","12EX7700","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400518","14-19 Oct. 2012","6381601","2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2012","IEEE","66","277","HIVEBEAT — A highly interactive visualization environment for broad-scale exploratory analysis and tracing: VAST 2012 Mini Challenge 1 award: Honorable mention for comprehensive visualization suite"
"The complex computer networks of large organisations contain many machines of many types, used in many geographic locations. Although system administrators should monitor the health of each machine, they need to do so within the context of the whole computer network. Our visualization presents the health of a fictitious financial institution's computer network at a snapshot in time and over a time range, and preserves the important aspects of each facility's administrative and geographic context.

"The Middlesex Spatial Interactive Visualisation Environment (M-Sieve) is a spatiotemporal visual analytics tool for exploring computer network activity. M-Sieve allows the user to filter and visualize data through facets to explore and find patterns. To help guide exploration, we developed a set of rules which are used to derive a variable we call the ‘Concern Level Assessment’ (CLA). The CLA is based on attributes of nodes on the network. The rules were developed by eliciting inferences from network security domain experts. The combination of M-Sieve and the CLA allowed us to address the problem presented by the VAST 2012 Competition — Mini Challenge 1.","","EPHEMERA","6400524","Middlesex University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086635381","1","S.

"VAST 2012 Challenge Award: Outstanding comprehensive submission, including multiple sizes. With the reliance of businesses, public institutions and individuals on large computer networks, maintaining their security becomes essential to ensure integrity. To achieve situational awareness, we developed Banksafe, which is a scalable, distributed and web-based visualization system to analyze health monitoring data and security datasets. To handle large amounts of data a cloud-based backend database is used to store and analyze the raw data. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach we use both VAST 2012 mini challenges. Our case studies successfully identify suspicious events, trends and patterns using multiple visualizations.","","EPHEMERA","6400528","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38242836400","1","Fabian Fischer","38242836400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38527541800","2","Johannes Fuchs","38527541800","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37392086200","3","Florian Mansmann","37392086200","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","4","Daniel A.

"In this paper, we introduce a GPU-accelerated visual analytics tool, AVIST. By adopting the in-situ visualization architecture on the GPUs, AVIST supports real-time data analysis and visualization of massive scale datasets, such as VAST 2012 Challenge dataset. The design objective of the tool is to identify temporal patterns from large and complex data. To achieve this goal, we introduce three unique features: automatic animation, disjunctive data filters, and time-synced visualization of multiple datasets.","","EPHEMERA","6400515","Virginia Tech","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37576808300","1","Yong Cao","37576808300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Virginia Tech","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085756735","2","Reese Moore","37085756735","Virginia Tech","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38581304300","3","Peng Mi","38581304300","Virginia Tech","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681759500","4","Alex Endert","37681759500","Virginia Tech","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37419565900","5","Chris North","37419565900","Virginia Tech","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37297982400","6","Randy Marchany","37297982400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","0","14-19 Oct. 2012","Seattle, WA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2012.6400515","284","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400515/","H.5.2 [Information Interfaces And Presentation]","User Interfaces—Interaction styles (e.g. commands","menus","forms","direct manipulation)","","","","","","","","","","6400483","978-1-4673-4752-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4752-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4753-2","12EX7700","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400515","14-19 Oct. 2012","6381601","2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2012","IEEE","72","283","Dynamic analysis of large datasets with animated and correlated views: VAST 2012 Mini Challenge # award: Honorable mention for good use of coordinated displays"

"The 2012 VAST Mini-Challenge 1 presented in excess of 158 million data points for analysis. The data consisted of network events from Bank of Money, a large organization whose branches spanned the entirety of fictional BankWorld, as well as the assets generating the events. Two network event datasets were used to analyze the network's state and determine what anomalies could be affecting it. The first dataset contained snapshot data of the network at 2 PM BankWorld Mean Time (BMT). The second contained all events from across the Bank of Money organization for the span of two days. Using the CoMotion® platform, analysts determined several different causes for concern within the data, such as compromised machine statuses, missing datacenter events and anomalous events encompassing entire Regions.","","EPHEMERA","6400519","General Dynamics C4 Systems","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086730344","1","Lya Laberge","37086730344","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","General Dynamics C4 Systems","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086735451","2","Sid Kaul","37086735451","General Dynamics C4 Systems","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086729898","3","Naomi Anderson","37086729898","General Dynamics C4 Systems","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086731094","4","Charles Agnew","37086731094","General Dynamics C4 Systems","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086733578","5","David Goldstein","37086733578","General Dynamics C4 Systems","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37560556500","6","Jake Kolojejchick","37560556500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","14-19 Oct. 2012","Seattle, WA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2012.6400519","276","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6400519/","CoMotion","visual analytics","cyber security","information security analysis","situation awareness","big data","interaction techniques","","","","","","","","6400483","978-1-4673-4752-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4752-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-4753-2","12EX7700","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6400519","14-19 Oct. 2012","6381601","2012 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2012","IEEE","75","275","Enhancing the “think loop process” with consistent interactions: VAST 2012 Mini Challenge 1 award: Honorable mention for good interaction techniques"
