"Multiresolution analysis is an important tool for exploring large-scale data sets. Such analysis provides facilities to visualize data at different levels of detail while providing the advantages of efficient data compression and transmission. In this work, an approach is presented to apply multiresolution analysis to digital Earth data where each resolution describes data at a specific level of detail. Geospatial data at a fine level is taken as the input and a hierarchy of approximation and detail coefficients is built by applying a hexagonal discrete wavelet transform. Multiresolution filters are designed for hexagonal cells based on the three directional linear box spline which is natively supported by modern GPUs.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429508/","LOCKED","7429508","University of Calgary","","1","Mohammad Imrul Jubair","","University of Calgary","","2","Usman Alim","","German Climate Computing Centre","","3","Niklas Roeber","","University Corporation for Atmospheric Research","","4","John Clyne","","University of Calgary","","5","Ali Mahdavi-Amiri","","University of Calgary","","6","Faramarz Samavati","","","","","","","","","","","","2","0","25-30 Oct. 2015","Chicago, IL, USA","Conferences","10.1109/SciVis.2015.7429508","152","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429508/","Multiresolution analysis","digital earth data","linear box-spline","hexagonal grid","","","Earth","Multiresolution analysis","Diamonds","Data visualization","Splines (mathematics)","Meteorology","Arrays","7429473","978-1-4673-9785-8","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-9785-8","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7429508","25-30 Oct. 2015","7411953","2015 IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference (SciVis)","2015","IEEE","1","151","Multiresolution visualization of digital earth data via hexagonal box-spline wavelets"
"PathlinesExplorer is a novel image-based tool, which has been designed to visualize large scale pathline fields on a single computer [7]. PathlinesExplorer integrates explorable images (EI) technique [4] with order-independent transparency (OIT) method [2]. What makes this method different is that it allows users to handle large data on a single workstation. Although it is a view-dependent method, PathlinesExplorer combines both exploration and modification of visual aspects without re-accessing the original huge data. Our approach is based on constructing a per-pixel linked list data structure in which each pixel contains a list of pathline segments. With this view-dependent method, it is possible to filter, color-code, and explore large-scale flow data in real-time. In addition, optimization techniques such as early-ray termination and deferred shading are applied, which further improves the performance and scalability of our approach.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429512/","LOCKED","7429512","KAUST","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085670914","1","Omniah H.

"To enable visualization research impacting other scientific domains, the availability of easy-to-use visualization frameworks is essential. Nevertheless, an easy-to-use system also has to be adapted to the capabilities of modern hardware architectures, as only this allows for realizing interactive visualizations. With this trade-off in mind, we have designed and realized the cross-platform Inviwo (Interactive Visualization Workshop) visualization framework, that supports both interactive visualization research as well as efficient visualization application development and deployment. In this poster we give an overview of the architecture behind Inviwo, and show how its design enables us and other researchers to realize their visualization ideas efficiently. Inviwo consists of a modern and lightweight, graphics independent core, which is extended by optional modules that encapsulate visualization algorithms, well-known utility libraries and commonly used parallel-processing APIs (such as OpenGL and OpenCL). The core enables a simplistic structure for creating bridges between the different modules regarding data transfer across architecture and devices with an easy-to-use screen graph and minimalistic programming. Making the base structures in a modern way while providing intuitive methods of extending the functionality and creating modules based on other modules, we hope that Inviwo can help the visualization community to perform research through a rapid-prototyping design and GUI, while at the same time allowing users to take advantage of the results implemented in the system in any way they desire later on. Inviwo is publicly available at www.inviwo.org, and can be used freely by anyone under a permissive free software license (Simplified BSD).","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429514/","LOCKED","7429514","Linkoping University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37063678500","1","Erik Sunden","37063678500","Linkoping University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085760977","2","Peter Steneteg","37085760977","Linkoping University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085409683","3","Sathish Kottravel","37085409683","Linkoping University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38228659100","4","Daniel Jonsson","38228659100","Linkoping University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085759366","5","Rickard Englund","37085759366","Linkoping University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37565763500","6","Martin Falk","37565763500","Ulm University","","7","Timo Ropinski","","","","","","","10","0","25-30 Oct. 2015","Chicago, IL, USA","Conferences","10.1109/SciVis.2015.7429514","164","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429514/","Inviwo","Interactive Visualization Workshop","Rapid Prototyping","Open Source Software","","","Data visualization","Computer architecture","Pipelines","Program processors","Licenses","Three-dimensional displays","","7429473","978-1-4673-9785-8","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-9785-8","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7429514","25-30 Oct. 2015","7411953","2015 IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference (SciVis)","2015","IEEE","3","163","Inviwo - An extensible, multi-purpose visualization framework"

"The study of physical phenomena and their dynamic evolution is supported by the analysis and visualization of time-enabled data. In many applications, available data are sparsely distributed in the space-time domain, which leads to incomprehensible visualizations. We present an interactive approach for the dynamic tracking and visualization of measured data particles through advection in a simulated flow. We introduce a fully GPU-based technique for efficient spatio-temporal interpolation, using a kd-tree forest for acceleration. As the user interacts with the system using a time slider, particle positions are reconstructed for the time selected by the user. Our results show that the proposed technique achieves highly accurate parallel tracking for thousands of particles. The rendering performance is mainly affected by the size of the query set.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429505/","LOCKED","7429505","Virginia Tech","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085641969","1","Mai Elshehaly","37085641969","Virginia Tech","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37323697500","2","Denis Gračanin","37323697500","Ain Shams University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085684904","3","Mohamed Gad","37085684904","Virginia Tech","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085578558","4","Junpeng Wang","37085578558","Alexandria University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38187835300","5","Hicham G.

"This project explores the representation of uncertainty in visualizations for archaeological research and provides insights obtained from user feedback. Our 3D models brought together information from standing architecture and excavated remains, surveyed plans, ground penetrating radar (GPR) data from the Carthusian monastery of Bourgfontaine in northern France. We also included information from comparative Carthusian sites and a bird's eye representation of the site in an early modern painting. Each source was assigned a certainty value which was then mapped to a color or texture for the model. Certainty values between one and zero were assigned by one subject matter expert and should be considered qualitative. Students and faculty from the fields of architectural history and archaeology at two institutions interacted with the models and answered a short survey with four questions about each. We discovered equal preference for color and transparency and a strong dislike for the texture model. Discoveries during model building also led to changes of the excavation plans for summer 2015.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429507/","LOCKED","7429507","Brown University","","1","Scott Houde","","Brown University","","2","Sheila Bonde","","Brown University","","3","David H.

A simple striped texture and shading were found to reduce judgement errors when used with a 3D tube glyph as compared to plain or shaded line glyphs.

"We present a novel model based on high-order access dependencies for high performance pathline computation in flow field. The high-order access dependencies are defined as transition probabilities from one data block to other blocks based on a few historical data accesses. Compared with existing methods which employed first-order access dependencies, our approach takes the advantages of high order access dependencies with higher accuracy and reliability in data access prediction. In our work, high-order access dependencies are calculated by tracing densely-seeded pathlines. The efficiency of our proposed approach is demonstrated through a parallel particle tracing framework with high-order data prefetching.

Our application enables users to interact with individual halos within these trees in order to perform a range of visual analysis tasks, including: identifying the substructure and superstructure of the halos; observing the movement of halos across a custom range of time steps; and comparing the branching attributes of multiple trees. Central to our application is the ability to navigate the halos by interactively ""jumping"" from tree to tree. By clearly marking halos that have ""tributaries"" — that is, that split off into multiple halos or merge with one or more halos — we make it easy for the user to traverse the complex structure of the universe. Our application is publicly available1 online and runs at interactive rates on the browser using hardware-accelerated graphics.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429495/","LOCKED","7429495","University of Illinois at Chicago","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085728341","1","Kyle R.

"We present the design and implementation of an immersive visual mining and analysis tool for cosmological data. The tool consists of an immersive linked multiview display which allows domain experts to interact with visual representations of spatial and nonspatial cosmology data. Nonspatial data is represented as time-aligned merger trees, and through a pixel-based heatmap. Spatial data is represented through GPU-accelerated point clouds and geometric primitives. The user can select a halo and visualize a 3D representation of the raw particles, as well as of the halos at the particular time stamp. We have demonstrated the tool to a senior staff member of the Adler Planetarium and report their feedback. The tool can assist researchers in the interaction navigation and mining of large scale cosmological simulation data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429497/","LOCKED","7429497","Electronic Visualization Laboratory University of Illinois at Chicago","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085778645","1","Peter Hanula","37085778645","Electronic Visualization Laboratory University of Illinois at Chicago","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085775128","2","Kamil Piekutowski","37085775128","Electronic Visualization Laboratory University of Illinois at Chicago","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38181235500","3","Carlos Uribe","38181235500","Electronic Visualization Laboratory University of Illinois at Chicago","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085728341","4","Kyle Almryde","37085728341","Electronic Visualization Laboratory University of Illinois at Chicago","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085621999","5","Arthur Nishimoto","37085621999","Adler Planetarium, Chicago, IL","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38119648300","6","Julieta Aguilera","38119648300","Electronic Visualization Laboratory University of Illinois at Chicago","","7","G.

"Our system design is motivated by the need to simultaneously observe multiple data modalities. The main output from the cosmological simulation is a set of particle data, where each particle represents a dark matter parcel which coalesces into larger structures over time. Next, the data is run through a halo finding algorithm (Rockstar [1]), which detects groups of gravitationally bound particles and identifies them as halos. Lastly, a merger tree generation tool (Consistent Trees [2]) analyzes the hierarchical evolution of halos as they continue to merge into larger structures. Although each of these data modalities are generated through an iterative process, an understanding of their interplay is essential. Since information about the raw particle data and the extracted halos inform one another, we designed a multi-view exploration tool and enhance these views with both qualitative and quantitative information. Because of the scale of the data and the multitude of features, we aim to provide capability to both locate and focus analysis on specific features of interest.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429499/","LOCKED","7429499","University of California at Davis, CA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085609111","1","Annie Preston","37085609111","University of California at Davis, CA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085492886","2","Franz Sauer","37085492886","University of California at Davis, CA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085625778","3","Ramyar Ghods","37085625778","University of California at Davis, CA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38667320300","4","Nick Leaf","38667320300","University of California at Davis, CA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38581201000","5","Jinrong Xie","38581201000","University of California at Davis, CA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275869400","6","Kwan-Liu Ma","37275869400","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","25-30 Oct. 2015","Chicago, IL, USA","Conferences","10.1109/SciVis.2015.7429499","114","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429499/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7429473","978-1-4673-9785-8","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-9785-8","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7429499","25-30 Oct. 2015","7411953","2015 IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference (SciVis)","2015","IEEE","15","107","Integrated explorer for cosmological evolution"
"One of the most vital challenges for weather forecasters is the correlation between two geographical phenomena that are distributed continuously in multidimensional multivariate time-varying datasets. In this research, we have visualized the correlation between Pressure and Temperature in the climate datasets. Pearson correlation is used in this study to measure the major linear relationship between two variables in the dataset. Using glyphs in the spatial location, we highlighted the significant association between variables. Based on the positive or negative slope of correlation lines, we can conclude how much they are correlated. The principal of this research is visualizing the local trend of variables versus each other in multidimensional multivariate time-varying datasets, which needs to be visualized with their spatial locations in meteorological datasets. Using glyphs, not only can we visualize the correlation between two variables in the coordinate system, but we can also discern whether any of these variables is separately increasing or decreasing. Moreover, we can visualize the background color as another variable and see the correlation lines around of a particular zone such as storm area.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429502/","LOCKED","7429502","Mississippi State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085733903","1","Najmeh Abedzadeh","37085733903","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","25-30 Oct. 2015","Chicago, IL, USA","Conferences","10.1109/SciVis.2015.7429502","140","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429502/","","","","","","","Correlation","Data visualization","Mathematical model","Image color analysis","Market research","Weather forecasting","","7429473","978-1-4673-9785-8","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-9785-8","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7429502","25-30 Oct. 2015","7411953","2015 IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference (SciVis)","2015","IEEE","16","139","Correlation analysis in multidimensional multivariate time-varying datasets"

"Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) together with tractography algorithms allow to probe for principal white matter tracts in the living human brain. Specifically, probabilistic tractography quantifies the existence of physical connections to a given seed region as a 3D scalar map of confidence scores. Fiber-Stippling is a visualization for probabilistic tracts that effectively communicates the diffusion pattern, connectivity score, and anatomical context. Unfortunately, it cannot handle multiple diffusion orientations per voxel, which exist in high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) data. Such data is needed to resolve tracts in complex configurations, such as crossings. In this work, we suggest a visualization based on Fiber-Stippling but sensible to multiple diffusion orientations from HARDI-based diffusion models. With such a technique, it is now possible to visualize probabilistic tracts from HARDI-based tractography algorithms. This implies that tract crossings may now be visualized as crossing stipples, which is an essential step towards an accurate visualization of the neuroanatomy, as crossing tracts are widespread phenomena in the brain.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429506/","LOCKED","7429506","Leipzig University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38230608700","1","Mathias Goldau","38230608700","Leipzig University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085615642","2","André Reichenbach","37085615642","Leipzig University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403333700","3","Mario Hlawitschka","37403333700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","25-30 Oct. 2015","Chicago, IL, USA","Conferences","10.1109/SciVis.2015.7429506","148","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429506/","I.3.3 [Computer Graphics]","Picture/Image Generation — Line and curve generation","","","","","Probabilistic logic","Data visualization","Context","Electronic mail","Phantoms","Optical fiber networks","Magnetic resonance imaging","7429473","978-1-4673-9785-8","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-9785-8","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7429506","25-30 Oct. 2015","7411953","2015 IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference (SciVis)","2015","IEEE","18","147","Visualizing crossing probabilistic tracts"
"Most of the existing approaches to visualize vector field ensembles are achieved by visualizing the uncertainty of individual variables from different simulation runs. However, the comparison of the derived feature or user-defined feature, such as the vortex in ensemble flow is also of vital significance since they often make more sense according to the domain knowledge. In this work, we present a framework to extract user-defined feature from different simulation runs. Specially, we use a bottom-up searching scheme to help to extract vortex with a user-defined shape, and further compute the geometry information including the size, and the geo-spatial location of the extracted vortex. Finally we design some linked views to compare the feature between different runs.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429510/","LOCKED","7429510","Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085456802","1","Richen Liu","37085456802","Argonne National Laboratory","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37595201300","2","Hanqi Guo","37595201300","Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403856700","3","Xiaoru Yuan","37403856700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","0","25-30 Oct. 2015","Chicago, IL, USA","Conferences","10.1109/SciVis.2015.7429510","156","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429510/","","","","","","","Three-dimensional displays","Meteorology","Visualization","Feature extraction","Computational modeling","Data models","Data visualization","7429473","978-1-4673-9785-8","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-9785-8","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7429510","25-30 Oct. 2015","7411953","2015 IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference (SciVis)","2015","IEEE","19","155","A bottom-up scheme for user-defined feature exploration in vector field ensembles"
"Species distribution models (SDM) are used to help understand what drives the distribution of various plant and animal species. These models are typically high dimensional scalar functions, where the dimensions of the domain correspond to predictor variables of the model algorithm. Understanding and exploring the differences between models help ecologists understand areas where their data or understanding of the system is incomplete and will help guide further investigation in these regions. These differences can also indicate an important source of model to model uncertainty. However, it is cumbersome and often impractical to perform this analysis using existing tools, which allows for manual exploration of the models usually as 1-dimensional curves. In this paper, we propose a topology-based framework to help ecologists explore the differences in various SDMs directly in the high dimensional domain. In order to accomplish this, we introduce the concept of maximum topology matching that computes a locality-aware correspondence between similar extrema of two scalar functions. The matching is then used to compute the similarity between two functions. We also design a visualization interface that allows ecologists to explore SDMs using their topological features and to study the differences between pairs of models found using maximum topological matching. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework through several use cases using different data sets and report the feedback obtained from ecologists.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429486/","LOCKED","7429486","New York University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38548192600","1","Jorge Poco","38548192600","New York University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38228713200","2","Harish Doraiswamy","38228713200","U.S. Geological Survey","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085626687","3","Marian Talbert","37085626687","U.S. Geological Survey","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085614504","4","Jeffrey Morisette","37085614504","New York University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275249200","5","Cláudio T.

"In this work we propose an effective method for frequency-controlled dense flow visualization derived from a generalization of the Line Integral Convolution (LIC) technique. Our approach consists in considering the spectral properties of the dense flow visualization process as an integral operator defined in a local curvilinear coordinate system aligned with the flow. Exploring LIC from this point of view, we suggest a systematic way to design a flow visualization process with particular local spatial frequency properties of the resulting image. Our method is efficient, intuitive, and based on a long-standing model developed as a result of numerous perception studies. The method can be described as an iterative application of line integral convolution, followed by a one-dimensional Gabor filtering orthogonal to the flow. To demonstrate the utility of the technique, we generated novel adaptive multi-frequency flow visualizations, that according to our evaluation, feature a higher level of frequency control and higher quality scores than traditional approaches in texture-based flow visualization.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429490/","LOCKED","7429490","Saarland University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38236609900","1","Victor Matvienko","38236609900","University Duisburg-Essen","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37548560500","2","Jens Krüger","37548560500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","0","25-30 Oct. 2015","Chicago, IL, USA","Conferences","10.1109/SciVis.2015.7429490","48","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429490/","flow visualization","texture-based visualization","LIC","Gabor filter","spatial frequency","image contrast","Visualization","Frequency control","Convolution","Kernel","Frequency-domain analysis","Context","","7429473","978-1-4673-9785-8","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-9785-8","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7429490","25-30 Oct. 2015","7411953","2015 IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference (SciVis)","2015","IEEE","21","41","Explicit frequency control for high-quality texture-based flow visualization"
"Numerical weather predictions have been widely used for weather forecasting. Many large meteorological centers are producing highly accurate ensemble forecasts routinely to provide effective weather forecast services. However, biases frequently exist in forecast products because of various reasons, such as the imperfection of the weather forecast models. Failure to identify and neutralize the biases would result in unreliable forecast products that might mislead analysts; consequently, unreliable weather predictions are produced. The analog method has been commonly used to overcome the biases. Nevertheless, this method has some serious limitations including the difficulties in finding effective similar past forecasts, the large search space for proper parameters and the lack of support for interactive, real-time analysis. In this study, we develop a visual analytics system based on a novel voting framework to circumvent the problems. The framework adopts the idea of majority voting to combine judiciously the different variants of analog methods towards effective retrieval of the proper analogs for calibration. The system seamlessly integrates the analog methods into an interactive visualization pipeline with a set of coordinated views that characterizes the different methods. Instant visual hints are provided in the views to guide users in finding and refining analogs. We have worked closely with the domain experts in the meteorological research to develop the system. The effectiveness of the system is demonstrated using two case studies. An informal evaluation with the experts proves the usability and usefulness of the system.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429488/","LOCKED","7429488","School of Software, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38542881800","1","Hongsen Liao","38542881800","State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085794116","2","Yingcai Wu","37085794116","School of Software, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37280383900","3","Li Chen","37280383900","NOAA Earth System Research Lab, Physical Sciences Division","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085798879","4","Thomas M.

This taxonomy will help researchers design experiments, ensure coverage, and generate hypotheses in empirical studies with volume datasets. To develop our taxonomy, we first interviewed scientists working with spatial data in disparate domains. We then ran a survey to evaluate the design participants in which were scientists and professionals from around the world, working with volume data in various scientific domains. Respondents agreed substantially with our taxonomy design, but also suggested important refinements. We report the results in the form of a goal-based generic categorization of visual analysis tasks with volume visualizations. Our taxonomy covers tasks performed with a wide variety of volume datasets.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429485/","LOCKED","7429485","Stanford University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37400143500","1","Bireswar Laha","37400143500","Virginia Tech","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282977600","2","Doug A.

"We propose a system to analyze and contextualize simulations of coronal mass ejections. As current simulation techniques require manual input, uncertainty is introduced into the simulation pipeline leading to inaccurate predictions that can be mitigated through ensemble simulations. We provide the space weather analyst with a multi-view system providing visualizations to: 1. compare ensemble members against ground truth measurements, 2. inspect time-dependent information derived from optical flow analysis of satellite images, and 3. combine satellite images with a volumetric rendering of the simulations. This three-tier workflow provides experts with tools to discover correlations between errors in predictions and simulation parameters, thus increasing knowledge about the evolution and propagation of coronal mass ejections that pose a danger to Earth and interplanetary travel.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429487/","LOCKED","7429487","Linkoping University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489536800","1","Alexander Bock","38489536800","NASA Goddard Space Flight Center","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085737408","2","Asher Pembroke","37085737408","NASA Goddard Space Flight Center","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085721511","3","M.

"Virtual testing is an integral part of modern product development in mechanical engineering. Numerical structure simulations allow the computation of local stresses which are given as tensor fields. For homogeneous materials, the tensor information is usually reduced to a scalar field like the von Mises stress. A material-dependent threshold defines the material failure answering the key question of engineers. This leads to a rather simple feature-based visualisation. For composite materials like short fiber reinforced polymers, the situation is much more complex. The material property is determined by the fiber distribution at every position, often described as fiber orientation tensor field. Essentially, the material's ability to cope with stress becomes anisotropic and inhomogeneous. We show how to combine the stress field and the fiber orientation field in such cases, leading to a feature-based visualization of tensor fields for composite materials. The resulting features inform the engineer about potential improvements in the product development.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429491/","LOCKED","7429491","Leipzig University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085688811","1","Valentin Zobel","37085688811","TU Dortmund University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085692798","2","Markus Stommel","37085692798","Leipzig University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282574800","3","Gerik Scheuermann","37282574800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3","0","25-30 Oct. 2015","Chicago, IL, USA","Conferences","10.1109/SciVis.2015.7429491","56","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429491/","tensor visualization","feature-based visualisation","composite materials","structural mechanics","","","Tensile stress","Visualization","Plastics","Injection molding","Data visualization","","","7429473","978-1-4673-9785-8","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-9785-8","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7429491","25-30 Oct. 2015","7411953","2015 IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference (SciVis)","2015","IEEE","26","49","Feature-based tensor field visualization for fiber reinforced polymers"
"B-mode ultrasound is a very well established imaging modality and is widely used in many of today's clinical routines. However, acquiring good images and interpreting them correctly is a challenging task due to the complex ultrasound image formation process depending on a large number of parameters. To facilitate ultrasound acquisitions, we introduce a novel framework for real-time uncertainty visualization in B-mode images. We compute real-time per-pixel ultrasound Confidence Maps, which we fuse with the original ultrasound image in order to provide the user with an interactive feedback on the quality and credibility of the image. In addition to a standard color overlay mode, primarily intended for educational purposes, we propose two perceptional visualization schemes to be used in clinical practice. Our mapping of uncertainty to chroma uses the perceptionally uniform L*a*b* color space to ensure that the perceived brightness of B-mode ultrasound remains the same. The alternative mapping of uncertainty to fuzziness keeps the B-mode image in its original grayscale domain and locally blurs or sharpens the image based on the uncertainty distribution. An elaborate evaluation of our system and user studies on both medical students and expert sonographers demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed technique. In particular for ultrasound novices, such as medical students, our technique yields powerful visual cues to evaluate the image quality and thereby learn the ultrasound image formation process. Furthermore, seeing the distribution of uncertainty adjust to the transducer positioning in real-time, provides also expert clinicians with a strong visual feedback on their actions. This helps them to optimize the acoustic window and can improve the general clinical value of ultrasound.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429489/","LOCKED","7429489","","","1","Christian Schulte Zu Berge","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085716865","2","Denis Declara","37085716865","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085358648","3","Christoph Hennersperger","37085358648","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37944985900","4","Maximilian Baust","37944985900","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085356050","5","Nassir Navab","37085356050","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","0","25-30 Oct. 2015","Chicago, IL, USA","Conferences","10.1109/SciVis.2015.7429489","40","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429489/","Ultrasound","Uncertainty Visualization","Confidence Maps","Real-time","","","Ultrasonic imaging","Uncertainty","Visualization","Image color analysis","Real-time systems","Biomedical imaging","","7429473","978-1-4673-9785-8","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-9785-8","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7429489","25-30 Oct. 2015","7411953","2015 IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference (SciVis)","2015","IEEE","27","33","Real-time uncertainty visualization for B-mode ultrasound"
"We present a novel approach that utilizes a simple handheld camera to automatically calibrate multi-projector displays. Most existing studies adopt active structured light patterns to verify the relationship between the camera and the projectors. The utilized camera is typically expensive and requires an elaborate installation process depending on the scalability of its applications. Moreover, the observation of the entire area by the camera is almost impossible for a small space surrounded by walls as there is not enough distance for the camera to capture the entire scene. We tackle these issues by requiring only a portion of the walls to be visible to a handheld camera that is widely used these days. This becomes possible by the introduction of our new structured light pattern scheme based on a perfect submap and a geometric calibration that successfully utilizes the geometric information of multi-planar environments. We demonstrate that immersive display in a small space such as an ordinary room can be effectively created using images captured by a handheld camera.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429493/","LOCKED","7429493","KAIST","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085619811","1","Sanghun Park","37085619811","KAIST","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085628777","2","Hyunggoog Seo","37085628777","KAIST","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085630211","3","Seunghoon Cha","37085630211","KAIST","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37720728400","4","Junyong Noh","37720728400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3","1","25-30 Oct. 2015","Chicago, IL, USA","Conferences","10.1109/SciVis.2015.7429493","72","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7429493/","I.3.3 [Computer Graphics]: Picture/Image Generation — Display algorithms","I.4.1 [Image Processing and Computer Vision]: Digitization and Image Capture — Imaging geometry","I.4.1 [Image Processing and Computer Vision]: Digitization and Image Capture — Camera calibration","I.3.3 [Hardware]","Input/Output Devices — Image display","","Cameras","Calibration","Three-dimensional displays","Multiplexing","Image color analysis","Electronic mail","Feature extraction","7429473","978-1-4673-9785-8","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-9785-8","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7429493","25-30 Oct. 2015","7411953","2015 IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference (SciVis)","2015","IEEE","28","65","Auto-calibration of multi-projector displays with a single handheld camera"

"Visualization of all types of data is a highly effective tool used by researchers to gain insight into natural phenomena and to communicate their findings. It is also an increasingly popular means of presenting large scientific datasets to the general public in informal educational settings such as museums and planetaria. Visualization has appeared in many forms and in many cultures throughout digital history and contributes to the evolving visual language of science. Dr. Donna Cox and the Advanced Visualization Laboratory team at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, University of Illinois, collaborate with science teams, writers, producers, educators, and media distribution professionals on content designed to engage a wide range of audiences. In the past 8 years alone, her collaborative educational and outreach projects have produced science narratives featuring data visualizations that have been viewed by more than 45 million people worldwide. Cox leads an NSF-funded project to create scientific visualizations and then test audiences' understanding of the phenomenon that is being presented. Large-scale computational data present unique visualization challenges for producers of high-resolution, production-quality 3D IMAX movies; feature films; and museum fulldomes. In this keynote, Cox will provide a visual feast of major projects, including new digital fulldome museum shows and award-winning IMAX films.","","EPHEMERA","7429482","University of Illinois, Chicago","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085805303","1","Donna J.
