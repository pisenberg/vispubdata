"Outputs from a physiologically based toxicokinetic (PB-TK) model for fish were visualized by mapping time series data for specific tissues onto a three dimensional representation of a rainbow trout. The trout representation was generated in stepwise fashion: cross sectional images were obtained from an anesthetized fish using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system; images were processed to classify tissue types; images were stacked and processed to create a three dimensional representation of the fish, encapsulating five volumes corresponding to the liver, kidney, muscle, gastrointestinal tract, and fat. Kinetic data for the disposition of pentachloroethane in trout were generated using a PB-TK model. Model outputs were mapped onto corresponding tissue volumes, representing chemical concentration as color intensity. The visualization was then animated, to show the accumulation of pentachloroethane in each tissue during a continuous branchial (gill) exposure.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/485169/","LOCKED","485169","Sci.

"Visualization, animation, and simulation techniques are applied to the problem of rotor design for helicopters. Periodic unsteady experimental velocity data (laser Doppler velocimetry or LDV) in two dimensions and velocity data derived from simulated vortex systems in three dimensions are compared using the same visual tools. Animations show the development of rotor wake systems and induced velocities over time. Modified particle trace integration schemes are used to calculate steady streamlines and unsteady particle paths for both kinds of data. In an extension of this work, a virtual environment (VE) system was used to view the wake vortex system and an interactive probe was used to explore the induced velocity field. Future work will enable interactive visual debugging and simulation steering.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/485150/","LOCKED","485150","Boeing Inf. & Support Services Res. & Technol., Bellevue, WA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38222544200","1","G.D.

"Invariant tori are examples of invariant manifolds in dynamical systems. Usual tools in dynamical systems such as analysis and numerical simulations alone are often not sufficient to understand the complicated mechanisms that cause changes in these manifolds. Computer-graphical visualization is a natural and powerful addition to these tools used for the qualitative study of dynamical systems, especially for the study of invariant manifolds. The dynamics of two linearly coupled oscillators is the focus of this case study. With little or no coupling between the oscillators, an invariant torus is present but it breaks down for strong coupling. Visualization has been employed to gain a qualitative understanding of this breakdown process. The visualization has allowed key features of the tori to be recognized, and it has proven to be indispensable in developing and testing hypotheses about the tori.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/485148/","LOCKED","485148","Sch. of Comput.

"Because of the nature of the die casting process, the part geometry severely restricts the die geometry and hence affects the quality of the part. However, as is often the case in other manufacturing processes, diecastings are currently designed purely based on their function. The manufacturability of the diecastings is not considered until the design has been nearly completed and detailed. This is due to the design support limitations of current CAE tools. We present a new volume-based approach to support diecastability evaluation, especially in preliminary design. Our approach can be applied to arbitrarily shaped parts without pre-defined feature libraries. The focus is on the identification of geometric characteristics, e.g. heavy mass regions, that could be responsible for thermal-related part defects. A distance transform with city-block metric is used to extract this geometric property. Volume visualization techniques are also adopted to allow users to visualize the results in a clear and precise way.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/485152/","LOCKED","485152","Dept. of Comput. & Inf.

"A recent study of a flow detail of an engine intake of future ground to orbit transport systems provided extremely complex data from numerical flow simulation and experimental flow visualization. The data posed a challenging problem to flow visualization, computational flow imaging (CFI), and the comparison of experimental imaging techniques versus computational imaging techniques. Some new visualization techniques have been implemented to provide compact representations of the complex features in the data. It turned out to be most useful to combine various specialized techniques for an icon-like representation of phenomena in a single image in order to study interaction of flow features. Some lessons were learned by simulating experimental visualization techniques on the numerical data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/485156/","LOCKED","485156","German Aerosp. Res.

"Many practical problems in open channel hydraulics that were traditionally investigated in hydraulic model experiments, are nowadays being solved by using computational fluid dynamics. However, in order to interpret computational results, there is a clear preference among scientists and engineers for visualization in analogy with experimental techniques. One such technique, particle tracing, enables a dynamic (Lagrangian) interpretation of a statically (Eulerian) computed vector field. However, quite often the emphasis in particle tracing is only on the mean flow properties, while effects due to dispersion and mixing are often not accounted for. Hence turbulent flow characteristics have to be incorporated in a visualization system for practical hydraulic engineering problems. The particle tracing technique presented in this case study has been specifically developed to combine both mean and fluctuating velocity vectors, thus simulating stochastic perturbations around mean flow conditions. A number of cases are presented that demonstrate the practical applicability of advanced visualization techniques in realistic engineering studies.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/485158/","LOCKED","485158","Strategic Res. & Dev., Delft Hydraulics, Netherlands","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38152247800","1","A.E.

"A standard method for visualizing vector fields consists of drawing many small ""glyphs"" to represent the field. This paper extends the technique from regular to curvilinear and unstructured grids. In order to achieve a uniform density of vector glyphs on nonuniformly spaced grids, the paper describes two approaches to resampling the grid data. One of the methods, an element-based resampling, can be used to visualize vector fields at arbitrary surfaces within three-dimensional grids.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480819/","LOCKED","480819","Lawrence Livermore Nat.

"A new method of tracking free ranging marine mammals has been developed which employs a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver to accurately fix an animal's position when it surfaces and a tri axial magnetometer and velocity time depth recorder to track the animals underwater movements between surfacings in 3 dimensions. Concurrent with the development of the electronics of this movement and position tracking (MAP) tracking system has been the development of ways to analyze data from the MAP system. Spray rendering has been used to visualize the data and to combine it with environmental data allowing biologists view the animals activity in an environmental context.

"As part of a large effort evaluating the effect of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, we are using the spatial selection features of an object relational database management system to support the visualization of the ecological data. The effort, called the Sound Ecosystem Assessment project (SEA), is collecting and analyzing oceanographic and biological data from Prince William Sound in Alaska. To support visualization of the SEA data we are building a data management system which includes a spatial index over a bounding polygon for all of the datasets which are collected. In addition to other selection criteria the prototype provides several methods for selecting data within an arbitrary region. This case study presents the requirements and the implementation for the application prototype which combines visualization and database technology. The spatial indexing features of the Illustra object relational database management system are linked with the visualization capabilities of AVS to create an interactive environment for analysis of SEA data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/485171/","LOCKED","485171","Dept. of Comput.

"The paper presents a splatting algorithm for volume rendering of curvilinear grids. A stochastic sampling technique called Poisson sphere/ellipsoid sampling is employed to adaptively resample a curvilinear grid with a set of randomly distributed points whose energy support extents are well approximated by spheres and ellipsoids. Filter kernels corresponding to these spheres and ellipsoids are used to generate the volume rendered image of the curvilinear grid with a conventional footprint evaluation algorithm. Experimental results show that our approach can be regarded as an alternative to existing fast volume rendering techniques of curvilinear grids.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480796/","LOCKED","480796","Dept. of Comput.

"An important goal of visualization technology is to support the exploration and analysis of very large amounts of data. In this paper, we propose a new visualization technique called a 'recursive pattern', which has been developed for visualizing large amounts of multidimensional data. The technique is based on a generic recursive scheme which generalizes a wide range of pixel-oriented arrangements for displaying large data sets. By instantiating the technique with adequate data- and application-dependent parameters, the user may greatly influence the structure of the resulting visualizations. Since the technique uses one pixel for presenting each data value, the amount of data which can be displayed is only limited by the resolution of current display technology and by the limitations of human perceptibility. Beside describing the basic idea of the 'recursive pattern' technique, we provide several examples of useful parameter settings for the various recursion levels. We further show that our 'recursive pattern' technique is particularly advantageous for the large class of data sets which have a natural order according to one dimension (e.g. time series data). We demonstrate the usefulness of our technique by using a stock market application.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/485140/","LOCKED","485140","Inst. for Comput.

"Reconstruction is used frequently in visualization of one, two, and three dimensional data. Data uncertainty is typically ignored, and a deficiency of many interpolation schemes is smoothing which may indicate features or characteristics of the data that are not there. The author investigates the use of iterated function systems (IFS's) for interpolation. He shows new derivations for fractal interpolation in two and three dimensional scalar data, and new point and polytope rendering algorithms with tremendous speed advantages over ray tracing. The interpolations may be used to give an indication of the uncertainty of the data, statistically represent the data at a variety of scales, allow tunability from the data, and may allow more accurate data analysis.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480798/","LOCKED","480798","Baskin Center for Comput.

"Flow volumes are extended for use in unsteady (time-dependent) flows. The resulting unsteady flow volumes are the 3D analogs of streaklines. There are few examples where methods other than particle tracing have been used to visualize time-varying flows. Since particle paths can become convoluted in time, there are additional considerations to be made when extending any visualization technique to unsteady flows. We present some solutions to the problems which occur in subdivision, rendering and system design. We apply the unsteady flow volumes to a variety of field types, including moving multi-zoned curvilinear grids.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/485146/","LOCKED","485146","Lawrence Livermore Nat.

"Presents a new method for adaptive surface meshing and triangulation which controls the local level-of-detail of the surface approximation by local spectral estimates. These estimates are determined by a wavelet representation of the surface data. The basic idea is to decompose the initial data set by means of an orthogonal or semi-orthogonal tensor product wavelet transform (WT) and to analyze the resulting coefficients. In surface regions where the partial energy of the resulting coefficients is low, the polygonal approximation of the surface can be performed with larger triangles without losing too much fine-grain detail. However, since the localization of the WT is bound by the Heisenberg principle, the meshing method has to be controlled by the detail signals rather than directly by the coefficients. The dyadic scaling of the WT stimulated us to build a hierarchical meshing algorithm which transforms the initially regular data grid into a quadtree representation by rejection of unimportant mesh vertices. The optimum triangulation of the resulting quadtree cells is carried out by selection from a look-up table. The tree grows recursively, as controlled by the detail signals, which are computed from a modified inverse WT. In order to control the local level-of-detail, we introduce a new class of wavelet space filters acting as ""magnifying glasses"" on the data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480805/","LOCKED","480805","Dept. of Comput.

"An important challenge in the visualization of three-dimensional volume data is the efficient processing and rendering of time-resolved sequences. Only the use of compression techniques, which allow the reconstruction of the original domain from the compressed one locally, makes it possible to evaluate these sequences in their entirety. In this paper, a new approach for the extraction and visualization of so-called time features from within time-resolved volume data is presented. Based on the asymptotic decay of multiscale representations of spatially localized time evolutions of the data, singular points can be discriminated. Also, the corresponding Lipschitz exponents, which describe the signals' local regularity, can be determined, and can be taken as a measure of the variation in time. The compression ratio and the comprehension of the underlying signal is improved if we first restore the extracted regions which contain the most important information.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480809/","LOCKED","480809","German Nat.

"Proposes a new approach to the automatic generation of triangular irregular networks (TINs) from dense terrain models. We have developed and implemented an algorithm based on the greedy principle used to compute minimum-link paths in polygons. Our algorithm works by taking greedy cuts (""bites"") out of a simple closed polygon that bounds the yet-to-be triangulated region. The algorithm starts with a large polygon, bounding the whole extent of the terrain to be triangulated, and works its way inward, performing at each step one of three basic operations: ear cutting, greedy biting, and edge splitting. We give experimental evidence that our method is competitive with current algorithms and has the potential to be faster and to generate many fewer triangles. Also, it is able to keep the structural terrain fidelity at almost no extra cost in running time and it requires very little memory beyond that for the input height array.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480813/","LOCKED","480813","Dept. of Comput.

"Diagrams are data representations that convey information predominantly through combinations of graphical elements rather than through other channels such as text or interaction. We have implemented a prototype called AVE (Automatic Visualization Environment) that generates diagrams automatically based on a generative theory of diagram design. According to this theory, diagrams are constructed based on the data to be visualized rather than by selection from a predefined set of diagrams. This approach can be applied to knowledge represented by semantic networks. We give a brief introduction to the underlying theory, then describe the implementation and finally discuss strategies for extending the algorithm.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480815/","LOCKED","480815","Dept. of Ind.

"Spot noise is a technique for texture synthesis, which is very useful for vector field visualization. This paper describes improvements and extensions of the basic principle of spot noise. First, better visualization of highly curved vector fields with spot noise is achieved, by adapting the shape of the spots to the local velocity field. Second, filtering of spots is proposed to eliminate undesired low frequency components from the spot noise texture. Third, methods are described to utilize graphics hardware to generate the texture, and to produce variable viewpoint animations of spot noise on surfaces. Fourth, the synthesis of spot noise on grids with highly irregular cell sizes is described.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480817/","LOCKED","480817","Fac. of Tech.

"Modular visualization environments utilizing a data-flow execution model have become quite popular in recent years, especially those that incorporate visual programming tools. However, simplistic implementations of such an execution model are quite limited when applied to problems of realistic complexity, which negate the intuitive advantage of data-flow systems. This situation can be resolved by extending the execution model to incorporate a more complete and efficient programming infrastructure while still preserving the virtues of pure ""data-flow"". This approach has been used for the implementation of a general-purpose software package, IBM Visualization Data Explorer.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480821/","LOCKED","480821","IBM Thomas J.

"Visual realism is necessary for many virtual reality applications. In order to convince the user that the virtual environment is real, the scene presented should faithfully model the expected actual environment. A highly accurate, fully modeled, interactive environment is thus seen as ""virtually real"". The paper addresses the problem of interactive visual realism and discusses a possible solution: a hybrid rendering paradigm that ties distributed graphics hardware and ray tracing systems together for use in interactive, high visual realism applications. This new paradigm is examined in the context of a working rendering system. This system is capable of producing images of higher fidelity than possible through the use of graphics hardware alone, able both to render images at speeds useful for interactive systems and to progressively refine static, high quality snapshots.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480791/","LOCKED","480791","Naval Res.

"A scalar volume V={(x,f(x))|x/spl isin/R} is described by a function f(x) defined over some region R of the three dimensional space. The paper presents a simple technique for rendering interval sets of the form I/sub g/(a,b)={(x,f(x))|a/spl les/g(x)/spl les/b}, where a and b are either real numbers of infinities. We describe an algorithm for triangulating interval sets as /spl alpha/ shapes, which can be accurately and efficiently rendered as surfaces or semi transparent clouds. On the theoretical side, interval sets provide an unified approach to isosurface extraction and direct volume rendering. On the practical side, interval sets add flexibility to scalar volume visualization-we may choose to, for example, have an interactive, high quality display of the volume surrounding or ""inside"" an isosurface when such display for the entire volume is too expensive to produce.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480789/","LOCKED","480789","Dept. of Comput.

"A parallel, analytic approach for defining and computing the inter and intra molecular interfaces in three dimensions is described. The molecular interface surfaces are derived from approximations to the power diagrams over the participating molecular units. For a given molecular interface our approach can generate a family of interface surfaces parametrized by /spl alpha/ and /spl beta/, where /spl alpha/ is the radius of the solvent molecule (also known as the probe radius) and /spl beta/ is the interface radius that defines the size of the molecular interface. Molecular interface surfaces provide biochemists with a powerful tool to study surface complementarity and to efficiently characterize the interactions during a protein substrate docking. The complexity of our algorithm for molecular environments is O(nk log/sup 2/ k), where n is the number of atoms in the participating molecular units and k is the average number of neighboring atoms-a constant, given /spl alpha/ and /spl beta/.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480793/","LOCKED","480793","Dept. of Comput.

"There are many applications that can benefit from the simultaneous display of multiple layers of data. The objective in these cases is to render the layered surfaces in a such way that the outer structures can be seen and seen through at the same time. The paper focuses on the particular application of radiation therapy treatment planning, in which physicians need to understand the three dimensional distribution of radiation dose in the context of patient anatomy. We describe a promising technique for communicating the shape and position of the transparent skin surface while at the same time minimally occluding underlying isointensity dose surfaces and anatomical objects: adding a sparse, opaque texture comprised of a small set of carefully chosen lines. We explain the perceptual motivation for explicitly drawing ridge and valley curves on a transparent surface, describe straightforward mathematical techniques for detecting and rendering these lines, and propose a small number of reasonably effective methods for selectively emphasizing the most perceptually relevant lines in the display.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480795/","LOCKED","480795","Dept. of Comput.

"Splatting is an object space direct volume rendering algorithm that produces images of high quality, but is computationally expensive like many other volume rendering algorithms. The paper presents a new technique that enhances the speed of splatting without trading off image quality. This new method reduces rendering time by employing a simple indexing mechanism which allows to visit and splat only the voxels of interest. It is shown that this algorithm is suitable for the dynamic situation in which viewing parameters and opacity transfer functions change interactively. We report experimental results on several test data sets of useful site and complexity, and discuss the cost/benefit trade off of our method.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480797/","LOCKED","480797","Dept. of Comput.

"Presents a conceptual framework and a process model for feature extraction and iconic visualization. Feature extraction is viewed as a process of data abstraction, which can proceed in multiple stages, and corresponding data abstraction levels. The features are represented by attribute sets, which play a key role in the visualization process. Icons are symbolic parametric objects, designed as visual representations of features. The attributes are mapped to the parameters (or degrees of freedom) of an icon. We describe some generic techniques to generate attribute sets, such as volume integrals and medial axis transforms. A simple but powerful modeling language was developed to create icons, and to link the attributes to the icon parameters. We present illustrative examples of iconic visualization created with the techniques described, showing the effectiveness of this approach.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/485141/","LOCKED","485141","Fac. of Tech.

"This paper reports on the development of a strategy to generate databases used for real-time interactive landscape visualization. The database construction from real world data is intended to be as automated as possible. The primary sources of information are remote sensing imagery recorded by Landsat's Thematic Mapper (TM) and digital elevation models (DEM). Additional datasets (traffic networks and buildings) are added to extend the database. In a first step the TM images are geocoded and then segmented into areas of different land coverage. During the visual simulation highly detailed photo textures are applied onto the terrain based on the classification results to increase the apparent amount of detail. The data processing and integration is carried out using custom image processing and geographic information systems (GIS) software. Finally, a sample visual simulation application is implemented. Emphasis is put on practical implementation to test the feasibility of the approach as a whole.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480799/","LOCKED","480799","Dept. of Geogr., Zurich Univ., Switzerland","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38153178500","1","M.

"Computational steering is the ultimate goal of interactive simulation: researchers change parameters of their simulation and immediately receive feedback on the effect. We present a general and flexible graphics tool that is part of an environment for computational steering developed at CWI. It enables the researcher to interactively develop his own interface with the simulation. This interface is constructed with 3D parametrized geometric objects. The properties of the objects are parametrized to output data and input parameters of the simulation. The objects visualize the output of the simulation, while the researcher can steer the simulation by direct manipulation of the objects. Several applications of 3D computational steering are presented.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/485143/","LOCKED","485143","Centre for Math. & Comput.

"An efficient algorithm is presented for computing particle paths, streak lines and time lines in time-dependent flows with moving curvilinear grids. The integration, velocity interpolation, and step size control are all performed in physical space which avoids the need to transform the velocity field into computational space. This leads to higher accuracy because there are no Jacobian matrix approximations, and expensive matrix inversions are eliminated. Integration accuracy is maintained using an adaptive step size control scheme which is regulated by the path line curvature. The problem of point location and interpolation in physical space is simplified by decomposing hexahedral cells into tetrahedral cells. This enables the point location to be done analytically and substantially faster than with a Newton-Raphson iterative method. Results presented show this algorithm is up to six times faster than particle tracers which operate on hexahedral cells, and produces almost identical traces.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/485145/","LOCKED","485145","Comput.

"Proposes an interactive method for exploring topological spaces based on the natural local geometry of the space. Examples of spaces appropriate for this visualization approach occur in abundance in mathematical visualization, surface and volume visualization problems, and scientific applications such as general relativity. Our approach is based on using a controller to choose a direction in which to ""walk"" a manifold along a local geodesic path. The method automatically generates orientation changes that produce a maximal viewable region with each step of the walk. The proposed interaction framework has many natural properties to help the user develop a useful cognitive map of a space and is well-suited to haptic interfaces that may be incorporated into desktop virtual reality systems.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480804/","LOCKED","480804","Dept. of Comput.

"Presents an algorithm that accelerates the extraction of iso-surfaces from unstructured grids by avoiding the traversal of the entire set of cells in the volume. The algorithm consists of a sweep algorithm and a data decomposition scheme. The sweep algorithm incrementally locates intersected elements, and the data decomposition scheme restricts the algorithm's worst-case performance. For data sets consisting of hundreds of thousands of elements, our algorithm can reduce the cell traversal time by more than 90% over the naive iso-surface extraction algorithm, thus facilitating interactive probing of scalar fields for large-scale problems on unstructured three-dimensional grids.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480806/","LOCKED","480806","Dept. of Comput.

"Presents a novel volume rendering method which offers high rendering speed on standard workstations. It is based on a lossy data compression scheme which drastically reduces the memory bandwidth and computing requirements of perspective raycasting. Starting from classified and shaded data sets, we use block truncation coding or color cell compression to compress a block of 12 voxels into 32 bits. All blocks of the data set are processed redundantly, yielding a data structure which avoids multiple memory accesses per raypoint. As a side effect, the tri-linear interpolation of data coded in such a way is very much simplified. These techniques allow us to perform walkthroughs at interactive frame rates. Furthermore, the algorithm provides depth-cueing and the semi-transparent display of different materials. The algorithm achieves a sustained frame generation rate of about 2 Hz for large data sets (/spl sim/200/sup 3/) at an acceptable image quality on an SGI Indy workstation. A number of examples are shown.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480810/","LOCKED","480810","Wilhelm-Schickard-Inst. fur Inf., Tubingen Univ., Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37296980500","1","G.

"To visualize the volume data acquired from computation or sampling, it is necessary to estimate normals at the points corresponding to object surfaces. Volume data does not holds the geometric information for the surface comprising points, so it is necessary to calculate normals using local information at each point. The existing normal estimation methods have some problems of estimating incorrect normals at discontinuous, aliased or noisy points. Yagel et al. (1992) solved some of these problems using their context-sensitive method. However, this method requires too much processing time and it loses some information on detailed parts of the object surfaces. This paper proposes the surface-characteristic-sensitive normal estimation method which applies different operators according to characteristics of each surface for the normal calculation. This method has the same advantages of the context-sensitive method, and also some other advantages such as less processing time and the reduction of the information loss on detailed parts.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480808/","LOCKED","480808","Dept. of Comput.

"Volume rendering generates 2D images by ray tracing 3D volume data. This technique imposes considerable demands on storage space as the data set grows in size. In this paper, we describe a method to render compressed volume data directly to reduce the memory requirements of the rendering process. The volume data was compressed by a technique called the Laplacian pyramid. A compression ratio of 10:1 was achieved by uniform quantization over the Laplacian pyramid. The quality of the images obtained by this technique as virtually indistinguishable from that of the images generated from the uncompressed volume data. A significant improvement in computational performance was achieved by using a cache algorithm to temporarily retain the reconstructed voxels to be used by the adjacent rays.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480812/","LOCKED","480812","Dept. of Comput.

Interaction with the program during execution is also required to facilitate parallel debugging.

We present a model for data-parallel program visualization that addresses both data collection/interaction and visualization issues.

"Presents a method for constructing tensor product Bezier surfaces from contour (cross-section) data. Minimal area triangulations are used to guide the surface construction, and the final surface reflects the optimality of the triangulation. The resulting surface differs from the initial triangulation in two important ways: it is smooth (as opposed to the piecewise planar triangulation), and it is in tensor product form (as opposed to the irregular triangular mesh). The surface reconstruction is efficient because we do not require an exact minimal surface. The triangulations are used as strong hints, but no more than that. The method requires the computation of both open and closed isoparametric curves of the surface, using triangulations as a guide. These isoparametric curves form a tensor product Bezier surface. We show how to control sampling density by filling and pruning isoparametric curves, for accuracy and economy. A rectangular grid of points is produced that is compatible with the expected format for a tensor product surface interpolation, so that a host of well-supported methods are available to generate and manipulate the surface.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480820/","LOCKED","480820","Dept. of Comput. & Inf.

"This paper describes an approach for interactive visualization of mixed scalar and vector fields, in which vector icons are generated from pre-voxelized icon templates and volume-rendered together with the volumetric scalar data. This approach displays simultaneously the global structure of the scalar field and the detailed features of the vector field. Interactive visualization is achieved with incremental image update, by re-rendering only a small portion of the image wherever and whenever a change occurs. This technique supports a set of interactive visualization tools, including change of vector field visualization parameters, real-time animation of vector icons advected within the scalar field, a zooming lens, and a local probe.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480818/","LOCKED","480818","Dept. of Comput.

"Maximum projection is a volume rendering technique that, for each pixel, finds the maximum intensity along a projector. For certain important classes of data, this is an approximation to summation rendering which produces superior visualizations. We show how maximum projection rendering with additional depth cues can be implemented using simple affine transformations in object space. This technique can be used together with 3D graphics libraries and standard graphics hardware, thus allowing interactive manipulations of the volume data. The algorithm presented allows for a wide range of tradeoffs between interactivity and image quality.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480790/","LOCKED","480790","Comput.

"Biological sequence similarity analysis presents visualization challenges, primarily because of the massive amounts of discrete, multi dimensional data. Genomic data generated by molecular biologists is analyzed by algorithms that search for similarity to known sequences in large genomic databases. The output from these algorithms can be several thousand pages of text, and is difficult to analyze because of its length and complexity. We developed and implemented a novel graphical representation for sequence similarity search results, which visually reveals features that are difficult to find in textual reports. The method opens new possibilities in the interpretation of this discrete, multidimensional data by enabling interactive investigation of the graphical representation.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/480794/","LOCKED","480794","Dept. of Comput.
