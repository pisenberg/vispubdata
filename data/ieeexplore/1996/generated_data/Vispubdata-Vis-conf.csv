Vis-conf,1996,Volume thinning for automatic isosurface propagation,10.1109/VISUAL.1996.568123,https://doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1996.568123,303,310,Conferences,"An isosurface can be efficiently generated by visiting adjacent intersected cells in order, as if the isosurface were propagating itself. We previously proposed an extrema graph method (T. Itoh and K. Koyamada, 1995), which generates a graph connecting extremum points. The isosurface propagation starts from some of the intersected cells that are found both by visiting the cells through which arcs of the graph pass and by visiting the cells on the boundary of a volume. We propose an efficient method of searching for cells intersected by an isosurface. This method generates a volumetric skeleton. consisting of cells, like an extrema graph, by applying a thinning algorithm used in the image recognition area. Since it preserves the topological features of the volume and the connectivity of the extremum points, it necessarily intersects every isosurface. The method is more efficient than the extrema graph method, since it does not require that cells on the boundary be visited.",,T. Itoh;Y. Yamaguchi;K. Koyamada,"Res.

Vis-conf,1996,Generation of transfer functions with stochastic search techniques,10.1109/VISUAL.1996.568113,https://doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1996.568113,227,234,Conferences,"This paper presents a novel approach to assist the user in exploring appropriate transfer functions for the visualization of volumetric datasets. The search for a transfer function is treated as a parameter optimization problem and addressed with stochastic search techniques. Starting from an initial population of (random or pre-defined) transfer functions, the evolution of the stochastic algorithms is controlled by either direct user selection of intermediate images or automatic fitness evaluation using user-specified objective functions. This approach essentially shields the user from the complex and tedious ""trial and error"" approach, and demonstrates effective and convenient generation of transfer functions.",,Taosong He;Lichan Hong;A.

The simplifications are dependent on viewing direction, lighting and visibility, and are performed by taking advantage of image-space, object-space and frame-to-frame coherences. A continuous level-of-detail representation for an object is first constructed off-line. This representation is then used at run-time to guide the selection of appropriate triangles for display. The list of displayed triangles is updated incrementally from one frame to the next. Our approach is more effective than the current level-of-detail-based rendering approaches for most scientific visualization applications where there are a limited number of highly complex objects that stay relatively close to the viewer.",,J.C.

Our goal is a systematic method for maximizing the total number of colours available for use, while still allowing an observer to rapidly and accurately search a display for any one of the given colours. Previous research suggests that we need to consider three separate effects during colour selection: colour distance, linear separation, and colour category. We describe a simple method for measuring and controlling all of these effects. Our method was tested by performing a set of target identification studies; we analysed the ability of thirty eight observers to find a colour target in displays that contained differently coloured background elements. Results showed our method can be used to select a group of colours that will provide good differentiation between data elements during data visualization.",,C.G.

The speed at which such triangulated surfaces can be displayed is crucial to interactive visualization and is bounded by the rate at which triangulated data can be sent to the graphics subsystem for rendering. Partitioning polygonal models into triangle strips can significantly reduce rendering times over transmitting each triangle individually. We present new and efficient algorithms for constructing triangle strips from partially triangulated models, and experimental results showing these strips are on average 15% better than those from previous codes. Further, we study the impact of larger buffer sizes and various queuing disciplines on the effectiveness of triangle strips.",,F. Evans;S. Skiena;A.

Taking into account ambient, diffuse, and specular reflection terms as well as transparency, we employ a realistic shading model which significantly increases quality and realism of the resulting images. While many graphics workstations offer hardware support for illuminating surface primitives, usually no means for an accurate shading of line primitives are provided. However, we show that proper illumination of lines can be implemented by exploiting the texture mapping capabilities of modern graphics hardware. In this way high rendering performance with interactive frame rates can be achieved. We apply the technique to render large numbers of integral curves in a vector field. The impression of the resulting images can be further improved by making the curves partially transparent. We also describe methods for controlling the distribution of stream lines in space. These methods enable us to use illuminated stream lines within an interactive visualization environment.",,M. Zockler;D. Stalling;H.-C.

Vis-conf,1996,Mesh reduction with error control,10.1109/VISUAL.1996.568124,https://doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1996.568124,311,318,Conferences,"In many cases the surfaces of geometric models consist of a large number of triangles. Several algorithms were developed to reduce the number of triangles required to approximate such objects. Algorithms that measure the deviation between the approximated object and the original object are only available for special cases. We use the Hausdorff distance between the original and the simplified mesh as a geometrically meaningful error value which can be applied to arbitrary triangle meshes. We present a new algorithm to reduce the number of triangles of a mesh without exceeding a user defined Hausdorff distance between the original and simplified mesh. As this distance is parameterization independent, its use as error measure is superior to the use of the L/sup /spl infin//-Norm between parameterized surfaces. Furthermore the Hausdorff distance is always less than the distance induced by the L/sup /spl infin//-Norm. This results in higher reduction rates. Excellent results were achieved by the new decimation algorithm for triangle meshes that has been used in different application areas such as volume rendering, terrain modeling and the approximations of parameterized surfaces. The key advantages of the new algorithm are: it guarantees a user defined position dependent approximation error; it allows one to generate a hierarchical geometric representation in a canonical way; it automatically preserves sharp edges.",,R.

Although researchers are aware of these uncertainties, little has been done to incorporate them in the existing visualization systems for fluid flow. In the absence of integrated presentation of data and its associated uncertainty, the analysis of the visualization is incomplete at best and may lead to inaccurate or incorrect conclusions. The article presents UFLOW-a system for visualizing uncertainty in fluid flow. Although there are several sources of uncertainties in fluid flow data, in this work, we focus on uncertainty arising from the use of different numerical algorithms for computing particle traces in a fluid flow. The techniques that we have employed to visualize uncertainty in fluid flow include uncertainty glyphs, flow envelopes, animations, priority sequences, twirling batons of trace viewpoints, and rakes. These techniques are effective in making the users aware of the effects of different integration methods and their sensitivity, especially near critical points in the flow field.",,S.K. Lodha;A.

Vis-conf,1996,Visualization over the World Wide Web and its application to environmental data,10.1109/VISUAL.1996.567610,https://doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1996.567610,81,86,Conferences,"Explores the way in which data visualization systems, in particular modular visualization environments, can be used over the World Wide Web. The conventional approach is for the publisher of the data also to be responsible for creating the visualization, and posting it as an image on the Web. This leaves the viewer in a passive role, with no opportunity to analyse the data in any way. We look at different scenarios that occur as we transfer more responsibility for the creation of the visualization to the viewer, allowing visualization to be used for analysis as well as presentation. We have implemented one particular scenario, where the publisher mounts the raw data on the Web, and the viewer accesses this data through a modular visualization environment-in this case, IRIS Explorer. The visualization system is hosted by the publisher, but its fine control is the responsibility of the viewer. The picture is returned to the viewer as VRML, for exploration via a VRML viewer such as Webspace. We have applied this to air quality data which is posted on the Web hourly: through our system, the viewer selects what data to look at (e.g. species of pollutant, location, time period) and how to look at it-at any time and from anywhere on the Web.",,J.

Vis-conf,1996,Hierarchical and parallelizable direct volume rendering for irregular and multiple grids,10.1109/VISUAL.1996.567606,https://doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1996.567606,57,63,Conferences,"A general volume rendering technique is described that efficiently produces images of excellent quality from data defined over irregular grids having a wide variety of formats. Rendering is done in software, eliminating the need for special graphics hardware, as well as any artifacts associated with graphics hardware. Images of volumes with about 1,000,000 cells can be produced in one to several minutes on a workstation with a 150-MHz processor. A significant advantage of this method for applications such as computational fluid dynamics is that it can process multiple intersecting grids. Such grids present problems for most current volume rendering techniques. Also, the wide range of cell sizes does not present difficulties, as it does for many techniques. A spatial hierarchical organization makes it possible to access data from a restricted region efficiently. The tree has greater depth in regions of greater detail, determined by the number of cells in the region. It also makes it possible to render useful ""preview"" images very quickly by displaying each region associated with a tree node as one cell. Previews show enough detail to navigate effectively in very large data sets. The algorithmic techniques include use of a k-d tree, with prefix-order partitioning of triangles, to reduce the number of primitives that must be processed for one rendering, coarse-grain parallelism for a shared-memory MIMD architecture, a new perspective transformation that achieves greater numerical accuracy, and a scanline algorithm with depth sorting and a new clipping technique.",,J.

Vis-conf,1996,Temporal continuity of levels of detail in Delaunay triangulated terrain,10.1109/VISUAL.1996.567600,https://doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1996.567600,37,42,Conferences,"The representation of a scene at different levels of detail is necessary to achieve real-time rendering. In aerial views, only the part of the scene that is close to the viewing point needs to be displayed with a high level of detail, while more distant parts can be displayed with a low level of detail. However, when a sequence of images is generated and displayed in real-time, the transition between different levels of detail causes noticeable temporal aliasing. In this paper, we propose a method, based on object blending, that visually softens the transition between two levels of Delaunay triangulation. We present an algorithm that establishes, in an off-line process, a correspondence between two given polygonal objects. The correspondence enables on-line blending between two representations of an object, so that one representation (level of detail) progressively evolves into the other.",,D. Cohen-Or;Y.

Classical multiresolution analysis is based on the knowledge of a nested set of functional spaces in which the successive approximations of a given function converge to that function, and can be efficiently computed. This paper first proposes a theoretical framework which enables multiresolution analysis even if the functional spaces are not nested, as long as they still have the property that the successive approximations converge to the given function. Based on this concept, we finally introduce a new multiresolution analysis with exact reconstruction for large data sets defined on uniform grids. We construct a one-parameter family of multiresolution analyses which is a blending of Haar and linear multiresolution, using BLaC (Blending of Linear and Constant) wavelets.",,G.-P. Bonneau;S.

The paper presents a simplification method which dynamically ""caches"" distant geometry into textures and trades off accurate rendering of the distant geometry for performance.

The floating point data is first converted to double-precision floating point format to maintain adequate precision throughout the transform process. It is then transformed using Haar wavelets-four times in two spatial dimensions, twice in the third spatial dimension, and twice in time for a total compression factor of 64 times. The double precision format will maintain enough precision during the transform to keep the process lossless. Next, the transformed data is compressed using Huffman coding and transmitted progressively using spectral selection. This allows most of the information to be transmitted in the first pass. Details are transmitted in later passes which ultimately provide for lossless reconstruction of the original data.",,A. Trott;R. Moorhead;J.

The method based on Distance Field Interpolation (DFI) gives a robust solution to this problem in its ability to deal with any topology in any dimension. Still this method may give undesired solutions to the problem if the changes from one cross-section to the next are significant relative to the size of the details in the cross-sections. We consider the problem of solid reconstruction from contours, which can also be considered as a contour blending or contour morphing problem, where the third dimension is time. The method presented is based on interpolation of the distance field, guided by a warp function which is controlled by a set of corresponding anchor points. Some rules for defining a smooth least-distorting warp function are given. To reduce the distortion of the intermediate shapes, the warp function is decomposed into a rigid rotational part and an elastic part. The distance field interpolation method is modified so that the interpolation is guided by the warp function. The advantage of the new approach is that it is capable of blending between contours having different topological genus, and no correspondence between the geometric primitives should be established. The desired general correspondence is defined by the user in terms of a relatively small number of anchor points.",,D. Cohen-Or;D. Levin;A.

Examples include tissue and tumor boundaries in medical imaging, molecular surfaces and force thresholds in chemical and pharmaceutical applications, and isosurfaces in a wide range of 3D domains. The 3D shape of such surfaces can be particularly difficult to interpret because of the unfamiliar, irregular shapes, the potential concavities and bulges, and the lack of parallel lines and right angles to provide perspective depth cues. Attempts to display multiple irregular surfaces by making some or all of them transparent further complicates the problem. Texture can provide valuable cues to aid in the interpretation of irregular surfaces. Opacity-modulating textures offer a mechanism for the display of multiple surfaces without the extreme loss of clarity of multiple transparent surfaces.

Recognizing the importance of unifying these processes, we present a new approach to the direct rendering of deformable volumes without explicitly constructing the intermediate deformed volumes. The volume deformation is done by a radial basis function that is piecewise linearly approximated by an adaptive subdivision of the octree encoded target volume. The octree blocks in the target volume are then projected, reverse morphed and texture mapped, using the SGI 3D texture mapping hardware, in a back-to-front order.

An added benefit of the proposed methods is that they reduce the amount of data being displayed and hence reduce clutter. The main idea behind these methods is the use of light sources to select and highlight regions in the flow field with similar directions. Varying the lighting conditions, by moving the light source and/or adding more lights, emphasizes different vector directions, set of directions, and vectors within a specified angle of a particular direction. The methods are straight forward, computationally inexpensive, and can be combined with other techniques that use glyph representation and other flow geometry such as streamlines for feature visualization.

Our original system visualized the most important variables from these reports. However, the biologists we work with found this system so useful they requested visual representations of other variables. We present an enhanced system for interactive exploration of this multivariate data. We identify a larger set of useful variables in the information space. The new system involves more variables, so it focuses on exploring subsets of the data. We present an interactive system allowing mapping of different variables to different axes, incorporating animation using a time axis, and providing tools for viewing subsets of the data.

Our approach is based on the perception that other flow visualization techniques use visualization objects that are locally tangential to the vector field together with directed light sources. From this, we developed the idea to shade streamlines at sampling points when raycasting a vector field. We extended this approach further to more abstract mappings where pseudo color is used.

In this method a potential field is formed around a tangled rope that causes it to self-repel. By allowing the rope to evolve in this field in search of an energy minimizing configuration we can determine the knot type of the initial configuration. In particular, it is natural to conjecture that if such a ""charged rope"" was not initially knotted, it will reach its minimal potential in a circular configuration, given a suitable energy functional. Because situations potentially arise in which the functional may not be strictly unimodal, we suggest it to be advantageous to use a robust stochastic optimization technique (simulated annealing), rather than a deterministic hill climber common in physically based approaches, to make sure that the evolving rope does not settle in a suboptimal configuration. The same method is applicable to simplifying arbitrary knots and links and for establishing knot equivalence.

This behavior was exploited in generating the constrained fractal surfaces in the work of Szeliski and Terzopoulos (1989), which were generated by using a Gibbs sampler algorithm. The algorithm involves locally perturbing a constrained spline surface with white noise until the spline surface reaches an equilibrium state. In this paper, we introduce a very fast generalized Gibbs sampler that combines two novel techniques, namely a preconditioning technique in a wavelet basis for constraining the splines and a perturbation scheme in which, unlike the traditional Gibbs sampler, all sites (surface nodes) that do not share a common neighbor are updated simultaneously.

We have developed software tools to support the analysis phase, using three different schemes for interpolating scattered 3D soil-quality data onto a grid suitable for viewing in an interactive visualization system. A good interpolation scheme is one that respects the distribution of the original data. We find that the original data can be decimated by up to seventy percent while exhibiting graceful degradation in quality. A prototype software system is being deployed to allow technicians to visually determine, while in the field with their monitoring equipment, where the highest concentrations of contaminants lie. The system is now in use by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.",,D.C. Banks;B. Hamann;Po-Yu Tsai;R. Moorhead;J.

We present a haptic interaction method that is suitable for both volume visualization and modeling applications. Point contact forces are computed directly from the volume data and are consistent with the isosurface and volume rendering methods, providing a strong correspondence between visual and haptic feedback. Virtual tools are simulated by applying three-dimensional filters to some properties of the data within the extent of the tool, and interactive visual feedback rates are obtained by using an accelerated ray casting method. This haptic interaction method was implemented using a PHANToM haptic interface.",,R.S. Avila;L.M.

This technique builds upon the force based methods that have been used previously to make visualisations of various types of data such as bibliographies and sets of software modules. The canonical force based model, related to solutions of the N body problem, has a computational complexity of O(N/sup 2/) per iteration. The paper presents a stochastically based algorithm of linear complexity per iteration which produces good layouts, has low overhead, and is easy to implement. Its performance and accuracy are discussed, in particular with regard to the data to which it is applied.

Vis-conf,1996,Octree-based decimation of marching cubes surfaces,10.1109/VISUAL.1996.568127,https://doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1996.568127,335,342,Conferences,"The marching cubes (MC) algorithm is a method for generating isosurfaces. It also generates an excessively large number of triangles to represent an isosurface; this increases the rendering time. This paper presents a decimation method to reduce the number of triangles generated. Decimation is carried out before creating a large number of triangles. Four major steps comprise the algorithm: surface tracking, merging, crack patching and triangulation. Surface tracking is an enhanced implementation of the MC algorithm. Starting from a seed point, the surface tracker visits only those cells likely to compose part of the desired isosurface. The cells making up the extracted surface are stored in an octree that is further processed. A bottom-up approach is taken in merging the cells containing a relatively flat approximating surface. The finer surface details are maintained. Cells are merged as long as the error due to such an operation is within a user-specified error parameter, or a cell acquires more than one connected surface component in it. A crack patching method is described that forces edges of smaller cells to lie along those of the larger neighboring cells. The overall saving in the number of triangles depends both on the specified error value and the nature of the data. Use of the hierarchical octree data structure also presents the potential of incremental representation of surfaces. We can generate a highly smoothed surface representation which can be progressively refined as the user-specified error value is decreased.",,R. Shekhar;E. Fayyad;R. Yagel;J.F.

Vis-conf,1996,Fast perspective volume rendering with splatting by utilizing a ray-driven approach,10.1109/VISUAL.1996.567608,https://doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1996.567608,65,72,Conferences,"Volume ray casting is based on sampling the data along sight rays. In this technique, reconstruction is achieved by a convolution, which collects the contribution of multiple voxels to one sample point. Splatting, on the other hand, is based on projecting data points on to the screen, and reconstruction is implemented by an ""inverted convolution"", where the contribution of one data element is distributed to many sample points (i.e. pixels). Splatting produces images of a quality comparable to ray casting but at greater speeds. This is achieved by pre-computing the projection footprint that the interpolation kernel leaves on the image plane. However, while fast incremental schemes can be utilized for orthographic projection, the perspective projection complicates the mapping of the footprints and is therefore rather slow. In this paper, we merge the technique of splatting with the principles of ray casting to yield a ray-driven splatting approach. We imagine splats as being suspended in object space, a splat at every voxel. Rays are then spawned to traverse the space and intersect the splats. An efficient and accurate way of intersecting and addressing the splats is described. Not only is ray-driven splatting inherently insensitive to the complexity of the perspective viewing transform, it also offers acceleration methods such as early ray termination and bounding volumes, which are methods that traditional voxel-driven splatting cannot benefit from. This results in competitive or superior performance for parallel projection, and superior performance for perspective projection.",,K. Mueller;R. Yagel,"Biomed. Eng.

Vis-conf,1996,Illustrating transparent surfaces with curvature-directed strokes,10.1109/VISUAL.1996.568110,https://doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1996.568110,211,218,Conferences,"Transparency can be a useful device for simultaneously depicting multiple superimposed layers of information in a single image. However, in computer-generated pictures-as in photographs and in directly viewed actual objects-it can often be difficult to adequately perceive the three-dimensional shape of a layered transparent surface or its relative depth distance from underlying structures. Inspired by artists' use of line to show shape, we have explored methods for automatically defining a distributed set of opaque surface markings that intend to portray the three-dimensional shape and relative depth of a smoothly curving layered transparent surface in an intuitively meaningful (and minimally occluding) way. This paper describes the perceptual motivation, artistic inspiration and practical implementation of an algorithm for ""texturing"" a transparent surface with uniformly distributed opaque short strokes, locally oriented in the direction of greatest normal curvature, and of length proportional to the magnitude of the surface curvature in the stroke direction. The driving application for this work is the visualization of layered surfaces in radiation therapy treatment planning data, and the technique is illustrated on transparent isointensity surfaces of radiation dose.",,V.

Visualizing and interacting with these hierarchies become daunting tasks. The problem is exacerbated if the visualization is to be done on mass-market personal computers, with limited processing power and visual resolution. Many of the current visualization techniques work effectively for hierarchies of 1000 nodes, but as the number of nodes increases toward 5000, these techniques tend to break down. Hierarchies above 5000 nodes usually require special modifications such as clustering, which can affect visual stability. This paper introduces Cheops, a novel approach to the representation, browsing and exploration of huge, complex information hierarchies such as the Dewey Decimal Classification system, which can contain between a million and a billion nodes. The Cheops approach maintains context within a huge hierarchy, while simultaneously providing easy access to details. This paper presents some preliminary results from usability tests performed on an 8-wide-by-9-deep classification hierarchy, which if fully populated would contain over 19 million nodes.",,L.

Our system constructs a 3D representation on-the-fly from incoming 2D ultrasound slices by modeling and rendering the slices as planar polygons with translucent surface textures. We use binary space partition (BSP) tree data structures to provide non-intersecting, visibility-ordered primitives for accurate opacity accumulation images. New in our system is a method of using parallel, time-shifted BSP trees to efficiently manage the continuously captured ultrasound data and to decrease the variability in image generation time between output frames.

An algorithm is presented that allows very rapid representation of an interval set surrounding an iso contour surface. The algorithm draws upon three main ideas. A fast indexing scheme is used to select only those data points near the contour surface. Hardware assisted splatting is then employed on these data points to produce a volume rendering of the interval set. Finally, by shifting a small window through the indexing scheme or data space, animated volumes are produced showing the changing contour values. In addition to allowing fast selection and rendering of the data, the indexing scheme allows a much compressed representation of the data by eliminating ""noise"" data points.",,R.A.
