However, planning the applicator placement such that the malignant tissue is completely destroyed, is a demanding task that requires considerable experience. In this work, we present a fast GPU-based real-time approximation of the ablation zone incorporating the cooling effect of liver vessels. Weighted distance fields of varying RF applicator types are derived from complex numerical simulations to allow a fast estimation of the ablation zone. Furthermore, the heat-sink effect of the cooling blood flow close to the applicator's electrode is estimated by means of a preprocessed thermal equilibrium representation of the liver parenchyma and blood vessels. Utilizing the graphics card, the weighted distance field incorporating the cooling blood flow is calculated using a modular shader framework, which facilitates the real-time visualization of the ablation zone in projected slice views and in volume rendering. The proposed methods are integrated in our software assistant prototype for planning RFA therapy. The software allows the physician to interactively place virtual RF applicator models. The real-time visualization of the corresponding approximated ablation zone facilitates interactive evaluation of the tumor coverage in order to optimize the applicator's placement such that all cancer cells are destroyed by the ablation.","article_number":"6064944","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064944","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064944/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064944/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"1812","end_page":"1821","citing_paper_count":55,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":1135,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Graphics processing unit","Electrodes","Radio frequency","Rendering (computer graphics)","Mathematical model","Ablation","Blood flow","Heat sinks"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Radiofrequency ablation","ablation zone visualization","distance field","volume rendering","GPU","interaction."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.244","title":"Topological Spines: A Structure-preserving Visual Representation of Scalar Fields","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":2,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282925900","id":37282925900,"full_name":"Carlos Correa","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37269320000","id":37269320000,"full_name":"Peter Lindstrom","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564112000","id":37564112000,"full_name":"Peer-Timo Bremer","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present topological spines−a new visual representation that preserves the topological and geometric structure of a scalar field.

Unlike other topological representations, such as contour trees, our approach preserves the local geometric structure of the scalar field, including structural cycles that are useful for exposing symmetries in the data. To obtain this representation, we describe a novel mechanism based on the extraction of extremum graphs−sparse subsets of the Morse-Smale complex that retain the important structural information without the clutter and occlusion problems that arise from visualizing the entire complex directly. Extremum graphs form a natural multiresolution structure that allows the user to suppress noise and enhance topological features via the specification of a persistence range. Applications of our approach include the visualization of 3D scalar fields without occlusion artifacts, and the exploratory analysis of high-dimensional functions.","article_number":"6064947","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064947","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064947/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064947/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"1842","end_page":"1851","citing_paper_count":38,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1211,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Topology","Data visualization","Approximation methods","Manifolds"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Scalar field topology","topological spine","extremum graph","Morse-Smale complex."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.199","title":"Feature-Based Statistical Analysis of Combustion Simulation Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":3,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Sandia National Laboratories, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37551867600","id":37551867600,"full_name":"Janine C.

Turbulent flows are ubiquitous and account for transport and mixing processes in combustion, astrophysics, fusion, and climate modeling among other disciplines. They are also characterized by coherent structure or organized motion, i.e. nonlocal entities whose geometrical features can directly impact molecular mixing and reactive processes. While traditional multi-point statistics provide correlative information, they lack nonlocal structural information, and hence, fail to provide mechanistic causality information between organized fluid motion and mixing and reactive processes. Hence, it is of great interest to capture and track flow features and their statistics together with their correlation with relevant scalar quantities, e.g. temperature or species concentrations. In our approach we encode the set of all possible flow features by pre-computing merge trees augmented with attributes, such as statistical moments of various scalar fields, e.g. temperature, as well as length-scales computed via spectral analysis. The computation is performed in an efficient streaming manner in a pre-processing step and results in a collection of meta-data that is orders of magnitude smaller than the original simulation data. This meta-data is sufficient to support a fully flexible and interactive analysis of the features, allowing for arbitrary thresholds, providing per-feature statistics, and creating various global diagnostics such as Cumulative Density Functions (CDFs), histograms, or time-series. We combine the analysis with a rendering of the features in a linked-view browser that enables scientists to interactively explore, visualize, and analyze the equivalent of one terabyte of simulation data. We highlight the utility of this new framework for combustion science; however, it is applicable to many other science domains.","article_number":"6064945","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064945","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064945/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064945/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"1822","end_page":"1831","citing_paper_count":32,"citing_patent_count":8,"download_count":870,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Feature extraction","Information analysis","Data mining","Data models","Statistical analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Topology","Statistics","Data analysis","Data exploration","Visualization in Physical Sciences and Engineering","Multi-variate Data."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.166","title":"Angular Histograms: Frequency-Based Visualizations for Large, High Dimensional Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":4,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Visual Computing Group, Swansea University, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38031256500","id":38031256500,"full_name":"Zhao Geng","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Computing Group, Swansea University, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Visual Computing Group, Swansea University, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38024566900","id":38024566900,"full_name":"ZhenMin Peng","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Computing Group, Swansea University, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Swansea University, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087363988","id":37087363988,"full_name":"Robert S.Laramee","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Swansea University, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Bangor University, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087364188","id":37087364188,"full_name":"Jonathan C.

In this paper we present two different approaches for this purpose, and we investigate the effectiveness of these approaches for intuitive 3D implant positioning in a medical operation planning system. The first approach uses cylindrical glyphs to depict distances, which smoothly adapt their shape and color to changing distances when the objects are moved. This approach computes distances directly on the polygonal object representations by means of ray/triangle mesh intersection. The second approach introduces a set of slices as additional geometric structures, and uses color coding on surfaces to indicate distances. This approach obtains distances from a precomputed distance field of each object. The major findings of the performed user study indicate that a visualization that can facilitate an instant and quantitative analysis of distances between two objects in interactive 3D scenarios is demanding, yet can be achieved by including additional monocular cues into the visualization.","article_number":"6064982","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064982","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064982/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064982/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"2173","end_page":"2182","citing_paper_count":20,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":584,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Implants","Biomedical image processing","Distance measurement","Image color analysis","Rendering (computer graphics)"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Distance visualization","biomedical visualization","implant planning","glyphs","distance fields."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.247","title":"TreeNetViz: Revealing Patterns of Networks over Tree Structures","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":6,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"College of Information Sciences and Technology, Pennsylvania State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37075500200","id":37075500200,"full_name":"Liang Gou","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Information Sciences and Technology, Pennsylvania State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Information Sciences and Technology, Pennsylvania State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547462","id":37086547462,"full_name":"Xiaolong Luke Zhang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Information Sciences and Technology, Pennsylvania State University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Network data often contain important attributes from various dimensions such as social affiliations and areas of expertise in a social network.

In this paper, we propose a compound graph model, TreeNet, to support visualization and analysis of a network at multiple levels of aggregation over a tree. We also present a visualization design, TreeNetViz, to offer the multiscale and cross-scale exploration and interaction of a TreeNet graph. TreeNetViz uses a Radial, Space-Filling (RSF) visualization to represent the tree structure, a circle layout with novel optimization to show aggregated networks derived from TreeNet, and an edge bundling technique to reduce visual complexity. Our circular layout algorithm reduces both total edge-crossings and edge length and also considers hierarchical structure constraints and edge weight in a TreeNet graph. These experiments illustrate that the algorithm can reduce visual cluttering in TreeNet graphs. Our case study also shows that TreeNetViz has the potential to support the analysis of a compound graph by revealing multiscale and cross-scale network patterns.","article_number":"6065012","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065012","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065012/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065012/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"2449","end_page":"2458","citing_paper_count":18,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":978,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Graphics","Tree data structures","Algorithm design and analysis","Complexity theory","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Compound graph","network and tree","TreeNetViz","visualization","multiscale and cross-scale."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.206","title":"GPU-Based Interactive Cut-Surface Extraction From High-Order Finite Element Fields","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":7,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Computing and the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37557887400","id":37557887400,"full_name":"Blake Nelson","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computing and the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, MIT, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275716100","id":37275716100,"full_name":"Robert M.

In practice, the investigator interactively selects from a palette of visualization tools to construct a scene that can answer a query of the data. This is effective as long as the implicit contract of image quality between the individual and the visualization system is upheld. OpenGL rendering of scientific visualizations has worked remarkably well for exploratory visualization for most solver results. This is due to the consistency between the use of first-order representations in the simulation and the linear assumptions inherent in OpenGL (planar fragments and color-space interpolation). Unfortunately, the contract is broken when the solver discretization is of higher-order. There have been attempts to mitigate this through the use of spatial adaptation and/or texture mapping. These methods do a better job of approximating what the imagery should be but are not exact and tend to be view-dependent. This paper introduces new rendering mechanisms that specifically deal with the kinds of native data generated by high-order finite element solvers. The exploratory visualization tools are reassessed and cast in this system with the focus on image accuracy.

However, the analysis of this type of data remains a challenge. One issue is the robust selection of neighborhoods − a crucial part of analytic tools such as topological decomposition, clustering and gradient estimation. When extracting the topology of sparsely sampled data, common neighborhood strategies such as k-nearest neighbors may lead to inaccurate results, either due to missing neighborhood connections, which introduce false extrema, or due to spurious connections, which conceal true extrema. Other neighborhoods, such as the Delaunay triangulation, are costly to compute and store even in relatively low dimensions. In this paper, we address these issues. We present two new types of neighborhood graphs: a variation on and a generalization of empty region graphs, which considerably improve the robustness of neighborhood-based analysis tools, such as topological decomposition. Our findings suggest that these neighborhood graphs lead to more accurate topological representations of low- and high- dimensional data sets at relatively low cost, both in terms of storage and computation time.

In this paper we propose a novel framework for the analysis of 2D information distributed over 3D geometry, based on a locally smooth parametrization technique that allows us to treat local 3D data in terms of image content. The proposed approach has been implemented as a sketch-based system that allows to design with a few gestures a set of (possibly overlapping) parameterizations of rectangular portions of the surface. We demonstrate that, due to the locality of the parametrization, the distortion is under an acceptable threshold, while discontinuities can be avoided since the parametrized geometry is always homeomorphic to a disk. We show the effectiveness of the proposed technique to solve specific Cultural Heritage (CH) tasks: the analysis of chisel marks over the surface of a unfinished sculpture and the local comparison of multiple photographs mapped over the surface of an artwork. For this very difficult task, we believe that our framework and the corresponding tool are the first steps toward a computer-based shape reasoning system, able to support CH scholars with a medium they are more used to.","article_number":"6064962","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064962","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064962/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064962/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"1989","end_page":"1996","citing_paper_count":14,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":434,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three dimensional displays","Shape analysis","Surface treatment","Geometry","Image processing","Length measurement","Solid modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Surface characterization","interactive inspection","Cultural Heritage","mesh parameterization","image processing."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.200","title":"Features in Continuous Parallel Coordinates","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":10,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Simulation and Graphics, University of Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601992200","id":37601992200,"full_name":"Dirk J.

Devices for understanding the rhetorical nature of narrative information visualizations are presented, informed by the rigorous application of concepts from critical theory, semiotics, journalism, and political theory. We draw attention to how design tactics represent additions or omissions of information at various levels−the data, visual representation, textual annotations, and interactivity−and how visualizations denote and connote phenomena with reference to unstated viewing conventions and codes. Classes of rhetorical techniques identified via a systematic analysis of recent narrative visualizations are presented, and characterized according to their rhetorical contribution to the visualization. We describe how designers and researchers can benefit from the potentially positive aspects of visualization rhetoric in designing engaging, layered narrative visualizations and how our framework can shed light on how a visualization design prioritizes specific interpretations. We identify areas where future inquiry into visualization rhetoric can improve understanding of visualization interpretation.","article_number":"6064988","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064988","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064988/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064988/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"2231","end_page":"2240","citing_paper_count":224,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":7626,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Rhetoric","Semiotics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Rhetoric","narrative visualization","framing effects","semiotics","denotation","connotation."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.229","title":"Quality Metrics in High-Dimensional Data Visualization: An Overview and Systematization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":14,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38267713800","id":38267713800,"full_name":"Enrico Bertini","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590724000","id":37590724000,"full_name":"Andrada Tatu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","id":37283138700,"full_name":"Daniel Keim","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this paper, we present a systematization of techniques that use quality metrics to help in the visual exploration of meaningful patterns in high-dimensional data.

Modern data visualization problems in the domains of news analysis, network security and financial applications, require visual analysis of incremental data, which poses specific challenges that are normally not solved by static visualizations. The incremental nature of the data implies that visualizations have to necessarily change their content and still provide comprehensible representations. In particular, in this paper we deal with the need to keep an eye on recent events together with providing a context on the past and to make relevant patterns accessible at any scale. Our technique adapts to the incoming data by taking care of the rate at which data items occur and by using a decay function to let the items fade away according to their relevance. Since access to details is also important, we also provide a novel distortion magnifying lens technique which takes into account the distortions introduced by the logarithmic time scale to augment readability in selected areas of interest. We demonstrate the validity of our techniques by applying them on incremental data coming from online news streams in different time frames.","article_number":"6065010","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065010","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065010/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065010/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"2432","end_page":"2439","citing_paper_count":117,"citing_patent_count":4,"download_count":1890,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Time series analysis","Data visualization","Lenses","Estimation","Event detection"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Incremental visualization","event based data","lens distortion."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.186","title":"Design Study of LineSets, a Novel Set Visualization Technique","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":18,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research and UC Santa Barbara, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38030020400","id":38030020400,"full_name":"Basak Alper","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research and UC Santa Barbara, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Limited, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590950700","id":37590950700,"full_name":"Nathalie Riche","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Limited, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38030407700","id":38030407700,"full_name":"Gonzalo Ramos","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Limited, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37563799500","id":37563799500,"full_name":"Mary Czerwinski","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, UK"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Computing and visualizing sets of elements and their relationships is one of the most common tasks one performs when analyzing and organizing large amounts of data. Common representations of sets such as convex or concave geometries can become cluttered and difficult to parse when these sets overlap in multiple or complex ways, e.g., when multiple elements belong to multiple sets. In this paper, we present a design study of a novel set visual representation, LineSets, consisting of a curve connecting all of the set's elements. Our approach to design the visualization differs from traditional methodology used by the InfoVis community. We first explored the potential of the visualization concept by running a controlled experiment comparing our design sketches to results from the state-of-the-art technique. Our results demonstrated that LineSets are advantageous for certain tasks when compared to concave shapes. We discuss an implementation of LineSets based on simple heuristics and present a study demonstrating that our generated curves do as well as human-drawn ones. Finally, we present two applications of our technique in the context of search tasks on a map and community analysis tasks in social networks.","article_number":"6064991","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064991","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064991/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064991/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"2259","end_page":"2267","citing_paper_count":115,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1702,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Social network services","Shape analysis","Accuracy","Geometry"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Set visualization","clustering","faceted data visualization","graph visualization."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.192","title":"Evaluation of Artery Visualizations for Heart Disease Diagnosis","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":19,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Engineering & Applied Sciences, Harvard University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017334100","id":38017334100,"full_name":"Michelle Borkin","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Engineering & Applied Sciences, Harvard University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Engineering & Applied Sciences, Harvard University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017335100","id":38017335100,"full_name":"Krzysztof Gajos","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Engineering & Applied Sciences, Harvard University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Engineering & Applied Sciences, Harvard University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089115014","id":37089115014,"full_name":"Amanda Peters","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Engineering & Applied Sciences, Harvard University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Applied Imaging Science Laboratory, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294083800","id":37294083800,"full_name":"Dimitrios Mitsouras","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Applied Imaging Science Laboratory, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"IPCF-CNR, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Italy","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37422034400","id":37422034400,"full_name":"Simone Melchionna","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IPCF-CNR, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Italy"]}},{"affiliation":"Applied Imaging Science Laboratory, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294079000","id":37294079000,"full_name":"Frank Rybicki","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Applied Imaging Science Laboratory, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Vascular Profiling Laboratory, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300850800","id":37300850800,"full_name":"Charles Feldman","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Vascular Profiling Laboratory, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Engineering & Applied Sciences, Harvard University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275698100","id":37275698100,"full_name":"Hanspeter Pfister","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Engineering & Applied Sciences, Harvard University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Heart disease is the number one killer in the United States, and finding indicators of the disease at an early stage is critical for treatment and prevention.

We present the results of a formal quantitative user study with domain experts that evaluates the effect of 2D versus 3D artery representations and of color maps on identifying regions of low ESS.

The flexibility comes from a script, depicted in this paper as a block diagram, which defines an advanced computation of a density field. We define six different types of blocks to create, compose, and enhance trajectories or density fields. Blocks are customized by means of expressions that allow the analyst to model domain knowledge. The versatility of our architecture is demonstrated with several maritime use cases developed with domain experts.

Eye tracking was used to identify visual exploration behaviors of participants that were asked to solve a typical hierarchy exploration task by inspecting a static tree diagram: finding the least common ancestor of a given set of marked leaf nodes. To uncover exploration strategies, we examined fixation points, duration, and saccades of participants' gaze trajectories. For the non-radial diagrams, we additionally investigated the effect of diagram orientation by switching the position of the root node to each of the four main orientations. We also recorded and analyzed correctness of answers as well as completion times in addition to the eye movement data. We found out that traditional and orthogonal tree layouts significantly outperform radial tree layouts for the given task.

Flexible Linked Axes enable users to define a wide variety of different visualizations.

We replace a tedious manual process that is often based on guess-work and luck by a principled approach that systematically explores the parameter space. Our core idea is the following two-stage technique: We start with a sparse sampling of the parameter space and apply a statistical model to estimate the response of the segmentation algorithm. The statistical model incorporates a model of uncertainty of the estimation which we use in conjunction with the actual estimate in (visually) guiding the user towards areas that need refinement by placing additional sample points. In the second stage the user navigates through the parameter space in order to determine areas where the response value (goodness of segmentation) is high. In our exploration we rely on existing ground-truth images in order to evaluate the \"goodness\" of an image segmentation technique. We evaluate its usefulness by demonstrating this technique on two image segmentation algorithms: a three parameter model to detect microtubules in electron tomograms and an eight parameter model to identify functional regions in dynamic Positron Emission Tomography scans.","article_number":"6064952","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064952","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064952/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064952/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"1892","end_page":"1901","citing_paper_count":83,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1529,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image segmentation","Computational modeling","Gaussian processes","Uncertainty","Response surface methodology"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Parameter exploration","Image segmentation","Gaussian Process Model."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.190","title":"Divided Edge Bundling for Directional Network Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":26,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017434000","id":38017434000,"full_name":"David Selassie","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38027228800","id":38027228800,"full_name":"Brandon Heller","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550791300","id":37550791300,"full_name":"Jeffrey Heer","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The node-link diagram is an intuitive and venerable way to depict a graph. To reduce clutter and improve the readability of node-link views, Holten & van Wijk's force-directed edge bundling employs a physical simulation to spatially group graph edges. While both useful and aesthetic, this technique has shortcomings: it bundles spatially proximal edges regardless of direction, weight, or graph connectivity. As a result, high-level directional edge patterns are obscured. We present divided edge bundling to tackle these shortcomings. By modifying the forces in the physical simulation, directional lanes appear as an emergent property of edge direction. By considering graph topology, we only bundle edges related by graph structure. Finally, we aggregate edge weights in bundles to enable more accurate visualization of total bundle weights. We compare visualizations created using our technique to standard force-directed edge bundling, matrix diagrams, and clustered graphs; we find that divided edge bundling leads to visualizations that are easier to interpret and reveal both familiar and previously obscured patterns.","article_number":"6065002","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065002","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065002/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065002/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"2354","end_page":"2363","citing_paper_count":83,"citing_patent_count":4,"download_count":918,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Encoding","Graphics","Image edge detection","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Graph visualization","aggregation","node-link diagrams","edge bundling","physical simulation."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.188","title":"DICON: Interactive Visual Analysis of Multidimensional Clusters","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":27,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604309600","id":37604309600,"full_name":"Nan Cao","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"]}},{"affiliation":"IBM Thomas J.

However, it is often difficult for users to understand and evaluate multidimensional clustering results, especially the quality of clusters and their semantics. For large and complex data, high-level statistical information about the clusters is often needed for users to evaluate cluster quality while a detailed display of multidimensional attributes of the data is necessary to understand the meaning of clusters. In this paper, we introduce DICON, an icon-based cluster visualization that embeds statistical information into a multi-attribute display to facilitate cluster interpretation, evaluation, and comparison. We design a treemap-like icon to represent a multidimensional cluster, and the quality of the cluster can be conveniently evaluated with the embedded statistical information. We further develop a novel layout algorithm which can generate similar icons for similar clusters, making comparisons of clusters easier. User interaction and clutter reduction are integrated into the system to help users more effectively analyze and refine clustering results for large datasets. We demonstrate the power of DICON through a user study and a case study in the healthcare domain. Our evaluation shows the benefits of the technique, especially in support of complex multidimensional cluster analysis.","article_number":"6065026","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065026","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065026/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065026/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"2581","end_page":"2590","citing_paper_count":80,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2420,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Clustering algorithms","Encoding","Image color analysis","Information analysis","Algorithm design and analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analysis","Clustering","Information Visualization."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.175","title":"Benefitting InfoVis with Visual Difficulties","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":28,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Michigan, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38016234500","id":38016234500,"full_name":"Jessica Hullman","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Michigan, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Michigan, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37331417100","id":37331417100,"full_name":"Eytan Adar","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Michigan, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Michigan, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38018860000","id":38018860000,"full_name":"Priti Shah","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Michigan, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Many well-cited theories for visualization design state that a visual representation should be optimized for quick and immediate interpretation by a user. Distracting elements like decorative \"chartjunk\" or extraneous information are avoided so as not to slow comprehension. Yet several recent studies in visualization research provide evidence that non-efficient visual elements may benefit comprehension and recall on the part of users. Similarly, findings from studies related to learning from visual displays in various subfields of psychology suggest that introducing cognitive difficulties to visualization interaction can improve a user's understanding of important information. In this paper, we synthesize empirical results from cross-disciplinary research on visual information representations, providing a counterpoint to efficiency-based design theory with guidelines that describe how visual difficulties can be introduced to benefit comprehension and recall. We identify conditions under which the application of visual difficulties is appropriate based on underlying factors in visualization interaction like active processing and engagement. We characterize effective graph design as a trade-off between efficiency and learning difficulties in order to provide Information Visualization (InfoVis) researchers and practitioners with a framework for organizing explorations of graphs for which comprehension and recall are crucial. We identify implications of this view for the design and evaluation of information visualizations.","article_number":"6064986","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064986","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064986/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064986/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"2213","end_page":"2222","citing_paper_count":78,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2127,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Psychology","Data visualization","Time factors","Cognition"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Desirable difficulites","cognitive efficiency","active processing","engagement","individual differences."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.196","title":"Exploring Ambient and Artistic Visualization for Residential Energy Use Feedback","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":29,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Interactive Arts Technology, Simon Fraser University, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399764800","id":37399764800,"full_name":"Johnny Rodgers","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Interactive Arts Technology, Simon Fraser University, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Interactive Arts Technology, Simon Fraser University, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37353447100","id":37353447100,"full_name":"Lyn Bartram","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Interactive Arts Technology, Simon Fraser University, Canada"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Providing effective feedback on resource consumption in the home is a key challenge of environmental conservation efforts.

Our case study, undertaken over three years, draws attention to repeating trends: that generic approaches fail to elicit adequate requirements for geovis application design; that the use of real data is key to understanding needs and possibilities; that trust and knowledge must be built and developed with collaborators. These processes take time but modified human-centred approaches can be effective. A scenario developed through contextual inquiry but supplemented with domain data and graphics is useful to geovis designers. Wireframe, paper and digital prototypes enable successful communication between specialist and geovis domains when incorporating real and interesting data, prompting exploratory behaviour and eliciting previously unconsidered requirements. Paper prototypes are particularly successful at eliciting suggestions, especially for novel visualization. Enabling specialists to explore their data freely with a digital prototype is as effective as using a structured task protocol and is easier to administer. Autoethnography has potential for framing the design process. We conclude that a common understanding of context of use, domain data and visualization possibilities are essential to successful geovis design and develop as this progresses. HC approaches can make a significant contribution here. However, modified approaches, applied with flexibility, are most promising. We advise early, collaborative engagement with data - through simple, transient visual artefacts supported by data sketches and existing designs - before moving to successively more sophisticated data wireframes and data prototypes.","article_number":"6065017","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065017","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065017/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065017/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"2498","end_page":"2507","citing_paper_count":73,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1884,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Human factors","Taxonomy","Domain specific languages"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Evaluation","geovisualization","context of use","requirements","field study","prototypes","sketching","design."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.183","title":"Context-Preserving Visual Links","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":31,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Graz Univeristy of Technology, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017759700","id":38017759700,"full_name":"Markus Steinberger","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Graz Univeristy of Technology, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Graz Univeristy of Technology, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37844773200","id":37844773200,"full_name":"Manuela Waldner","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Graz Univeristy of Technology, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Graz Univeristy of Technology, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403918900","id":37403918900,"full_name":"Marc Streit","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Graz Univeristy of Technology, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Graz Univeristy of Technology, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37395933400","id":37395933400,"full_name":"Alexander Lex","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Graz Univeristy of Technology, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Graz Univeristy of Technology, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37297103800","id":37297103800,"full_name":"Dieter Schmalstieg","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Graz Univeristy of Technology, Austria"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Evaluating, comparing, and interpreting related pieces of information are tasks that are commonly performed during visual data analysis and in many kinds of information-intensive work. Synchronized visual highlighting of related elements is a well-known technique used to assist this task. An alternative approach, which is more invasive but also more expressive is visual linking in which line connections are rendered between related elements. In this work, we present context-preserving visual links as a new method for generating visual links. The method specifically aims to fulfill the following two goals: first, visual links should minimize the occlusion of important information; second, links should visually stand out from surrounding information by minimizing visual interference. We employ an image-based analysis of visual saliency to determine the important regions in the original representation. A consequence of the image-based approach is that our technique is application-independent and can be employed in a large number of visual data analysis scenarios in which the underlying content cannot or should not be altered. We conducted a controlled experiment that indicates that users can find linked elements in complex visualizations more quickly and with greater subjective satisfaction than in complex visualizations in which plain highlighting is used. Context-preserving visual links were perceived as visually more attractive than traditional visual links that do not account for the context information.","article_number":"6064990","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064990","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064990/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064990/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"2249","end_page":"2258","citing_paper_count":71,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1037,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Image color analysis","Histograms"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual links","highlighting","connectedness","routing","image-based","saliency."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.178","title":"Brushing Dimensions - A Dual Visual Analysis Model for High-Dimensional Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":32,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Norway","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37567685600","id":37567685600,"full_name":"Cagatay Turkay","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Norway"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Statistics and Probability Theory, Vienna University of Technology, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017354300","id":38017354300,"full_name":"Peter Filzmoser","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Statistics and Probability Theory, Vienna University of Technology, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Norway","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274158800","id":37274158800,"full_name":"Helwig Hauser","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Norway"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In many application fields, data analysts have to deal with datasets that contain many expressions per item.

The context of our work is with regard the popularity of mobile devices. The best route to the destination, which can be obtained from the arrival time of trains, is highlighted. The stations on the route enjoy larger spaces, whereas the other stations are rendered smaller and closer to fit the whole map into a screen. To simplify the navigation and route planning for visitors, we formulate various map characteristics such as octilinear transportation lines and regular station distances into energy terms. We then solve for the optimal layout in a least squares sense.

Our system achieves real-time performance by being able to report instant information because of the carefully designed energy terms.

The model allows us to derive a novel correlation between the size of the vortex and its strength, measured as the square of its strain minus the square of its vorticity. For vortex detection in real models we use the strength parameter to locate potential vortex cores, then measure the similarity of our ideal analytical vortex and the real vortex core for different strength thresholds. This approach provides a metric for how well a vortex core is modeled by an ideal vortex. Moreover, this provides insight into the problem of choosing the thresholds that identify a vortex. By selecting a target coefficient of determination (i.e., statistical confidence), we determine on a per-vortex basis what threshold of the strength parameter would be required to extract that vortex at the chosen confidence. We validate our approach on real data from a global ocean simulation and derive from it a map of expected vortex strengths over the global ocean.","article_number":"6064973","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064973","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064973/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064973/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"2088","end_page":"2095","citing_paper_count":57,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":662,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Feature extraction","Information analysis","Data visualization","Data mining","Data models","Atmospheric modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Vortex extraction","feature extraction","statistical data analysis."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.161","title":"About the Influence of Illumination Models on Image Comprehension in Direct Volume Rendering","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":36,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Visualization and Computer Graphics Research Group, University of Münster, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017009000","id":38017009000,"full_name":"Florian Lindemann","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visualization and Computer Graphics Research Group, University of Münster, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Scientific Visualization Group, Linköping University, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295281400","id":37295281400,"full_name":"Timo Ropinski","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Scientific Visualization Group, Linköping University, Sweden"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this paper, we present a user study in which we have investigated the influence of seven state-of-the-art volumetric illumination models on the spatial perception of volume rendered images.

To evaluate these models, users had to solve three tasks relying on correct depth as well as size perception. Our motivation for these three tasks was to find relations between the used illumination model, user accuracy and the elapsed time. In an additional task, users had to subjectively judge the output of the tested models. After first reviewing the models and their features, we will introduce the individual tasks and discuss their results. We discovered statistically significant differences in the testing performance of the techniques.

There has been comparatively little research on how to support the more elaborate tasks associated with the exploratory visual analysis of timeseries, e.g., visualizing derived values, identifying correlations, or discovering anomalies beyond obvious outliers. Such tasks typically require deriving new time-series from the original data, trying different functions and parameters in an iterative manner.

This incurs a time cost of up to several days. We analyze and characterize the conventional parameter optimization process for image analysis and formulate user requirements. With this as input, we propose a change in paradigm by optimizing parameters based on parameter sampling and interactive visual exploration. To save time and reduce memory load, users are only involved in the first step - initialization of sampling - and the last step - visual analysis of output. This helps users to more thoroughly explore the parameter space and produce higher quality results. We describe a custom sampling plug-in we developed for CellProfiler - a popular biomedical image analysis framework. Our main focus is the development of an interactive visualization technique that enables users to analyze the relationships between sampled input parameters and corresponding output. We implemented this in a prototype called Paramorama. It provides users with a visual overview of parameters and their sampled values. User-defined areas of interest are presented in a structured way that includes image-based output and a novel layout algorithm. To find optimal parameter settings, users can tag high- and low-quality results to refine their search. We include two case studies to illustrate the utility of this approach.","article_number":"6065007","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065007","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065007/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065007/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"2402","end_page":"2411","citing_paper_count":51,"citing_patent_count":2,"download_count":1067,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Information processing","Image analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Sampling methods"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Information visualization","visual analytics","parameter space","image analysis","sampling."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.169","title":"Asymmetric Relations in Longitudinal Social Networks","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":39,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer & Information Science, University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550836200","id":37550836200,"full_name":"Ulrik Brandes","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer & Information Science, University of Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer & Information Science, University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38016272500","id":38016272500,"full_name":"Bobo Nick","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer & Information Science, University of Konstanz, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In modeling and analysis of longitudinal social networks, visual exploration is used in particular to complement and inform other methods.

Our technique utilizes stereoscopic depth to highlight regions of interest in a 2D graph by projecting these parts onto a plane closer to the viewpoint of the user. This technique aims to isolate and magnify specific portions of the graph that need to be explored in detail without resorting to other highlighting techniques like color or motion, which can then be reserved to encode other data attributes. This mechanism of stereoscopic highlighting also enables focus+context views by juxtaposing a detailed image of a region of interest with the overall graph, which is visualized at a further depth with correspondingly less detail. In order to validate our technique, we ran a controlled experiment with 16 subjects comparing static visual highlighting to stereoscopic highlighting on 2D and 3D graph layouts for a range of tasks. Our results show that while for most tasks the difference in performance between stereoscopic highlighting alone and static visual highlighting is not statistically significant, users performed better when both highlighting methods were used concurrently. In more complicated tasks, 3D layout with static visual highlighting outperformed 2D layouts with a single highlighting method. However, it did not outperform the 2D layout utilizing both highlighting techniques simultaneously. Based on these results, we conclude that stereoscopic highlighting is a promising technique that can significantly enhance graph visualizations for certain use cases.","article_number":"6064999","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064999","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064999/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064999/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"2325","end_page":"2333","citing_paper_count":50,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1188,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Two dimensional displays","Graphics","Stereo image processing","Data visualization","Image color analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Graph visualization","stereo displays","virtual reality."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.251","title":"Visual Thinking In Action: Visualizations As Used On Whiteboards","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":41,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Calgary, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38016653500","id":38016653500,"full_name":"Jagoda Walny","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Calgary and Microsoft Research, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37285000100","id":37285000100,"full_name":"Sheelagh Carpendale","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary and Microsoft Research, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Limited, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38328504500","id":38328504500,"full_name":"Nathalie Henry Riche","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Limited, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37312523900","id":37312523900,"full_name":"Gina Venolia","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research and University of Washington, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017515000","id":38017515000,"full_name":"Philip Fawcett","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research and University of Washington, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"While it is still most common for information visualization researchers to develop new visualizations from a data- or taskdriven perspective, there is growing interest in understanding the types of visualizations people create by themselves for personal use.

The usefulness of 3D visualizations has been demonstrated for many types of treatment planning. Nevertheless, full access to 3D renderings outside of the radiology department is still scarce even for many image-centric specialties. Our work stems from the hypothesis that this under-utilization is partly due to existing visualization systems not taking the prerequisites of this application domain fully into account. We have developed a medical visualization table intended to better fit the clinical reality. The overall design goals were two-fold: similarity to a real physical situation and a very low learning threshold. This paper describes the development of the visualization table with focus on key design decisions. The developed features include two novel interaction components for touch tables. A user study including five orthopedic surgeons demonstrates that the system is appropriate and useful for this application domain.","article_number":"6064940","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064940","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064940/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064940/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"1775","end_page":"1784","citing_paper_count":49,"citing_patent_count":2,"download_count":1841,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three dimensional displays","Surgery","Biomedical image processing","Orthopedic surgery"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Medical visualization","multitouch","tabletop display","treatment planning."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.243","title":"The FLOWLENS: A Focus-and-Context Visualization Approach for Exploration of Blood Flow in Cerebral Aneurysms","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":43,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Simulation and Graphics, University of Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017015100","id":38017015100,"full_name":"Rocco Gasteiger","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Simulation and Graphics, University of Magdeburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Simulation and Graphics, University of Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38030357700","id":38030357700,"full_name":"Mathias Neugebauer","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Simulation and Graphics, University of Magdeburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Neuroradiology, University Hospital Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017002900","id":38017002900,"full_name":"Oliver Beuing","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Neuroradiology, University Hospital Magdeburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Simulation and Graphics, University of Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37424645300","id":37424645300,"full_name":"Bernhard Preim","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Simulation and Graphics, University of Magdeburg, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Blood flow and derived data are essential to investigate the initiation and progression of cerebral aneurysms as well as their risk of rupture. An effective visual exploration of several hemodynamic attributes like the wall shear stress (WSS) and the inflow jet is necessary to understand the hemodynamics. Moreover, the correlation between focus-and-context attributes is of particular interest. An expressive visualization of these attributes and anatomic information requires appropriate visualization techniques to minimize visual clutter and occlusions. We present the FLOWLENS as a focus-and-context approach that addresses these requirements. We group relevant hemodynamic attributes to pairs of focus-and-context attributes and assign them to different anatomic scopes. For each scope, we propose several FLOWLENS visualization templates to provide a flexible visual filtering of the involved hemodynamic pairs. A template consists of the visualization of the focus attribute and the additional depiction of the context attribute inside the lens. Furthermore, the FLOWLENS supports local probing and the exploration of attribute changes over time. The FLOWLENS minimizes visual cluttering, occlusions, and provides a flexible exploration of a region of interest. We have applied our approach to seven representative datasets, including steady and unsteady flow data from CFD simulations and 4D PC-MRI measurements. Informal user interviews with three domain experts confirm the usefulness of our approach.","article_number":"6064983","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064983","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064983/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064983/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"2183","end_page":"2192","citing_paper_count":48,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":838,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Flow visualization","Aneurysm","Hemodynamics","Rendering (computer graphics)","Shape analysis","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Flow Visualization","Focus-and-Context","Illustrative Rendering","Aneurysm."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.223","title":"MoleView: An Attribute and Structure-Based Semantic Lens for Large Element-Based Plots","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":44,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"DGAC/DTI Research and Development, ENAC, University of Toulouse, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017336200","id":38017336200,"full_name":"Christophe Hurter","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["DGAC/DTI Research and Development, ENAC, University of Toulouse, France"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Groningen, Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268047100","id":37268047100,"full_name":"Alexandru Telea","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Groningen, Netherlands"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Groningen, Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37672044200","id":37672044200,"full_name":"Ozan Ersoy","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Groningen, Netherlands"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present MoleView, a novel technique for interactive exploration of multivariate relational data.

Adopting the visual metaphor of radar displays, this glyph represents flow directions by angles and time by radius in spherical coordinates. Dense seeding of flow radar glyphs on the flow domain naturally lends itself to multi-scale visualization: zoomed-out views show aggregated overviews, zooming-in enables detailed analysis of spatial and temporal characteristics. Uncertainty visualization is supported by extending the glyph to display possible ranges of flow directions. The paper focuses on 2D flow, but includes a discussion of 3D flow as well. Examples from CFD and the field of stochastic hydrogeology show that it is easy to discriminate regions of different spatiotemporal flow behavior and regions of different uncertainty variations in space and time. The examples also demonstrate that parameter studies can be analyzed because the glyph design facilitates comparative visualization. Finally, different variants of interactive GPU-accelerated implementations are discussed.","article_number":"6064958","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064958","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064958/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064958/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"1949","end_page":"1958","citing_paper_count":47,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1450,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Three dimensional displays","Vectors","Radar imaging","Uncertainty"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","glyph","uncertainty","unsteady flow."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.259","title":"Voronoi-Based Extraction and Visualization of Molecular Paths","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":46,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017029700","id":38017029700,"full_name":"Norbert Lindow","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38182750200","id":38182750200,"full_name":"Daniel Baum","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282272000","id":37282272000,"full_name":"Hans-Christian Hege","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Visual analysis is widely used to study the behavior of molecules.

One use of supercomputers is to generate field lines from large scale flow fields. When generating field lines in parallel, the vector field is generally decomposed into blocks, which are then assigned to processors. Since various regions of the vector field can have different flow complexity, processors will require varying amounts of computation time to trace their particles, causing load imbalance, and thus limiting the performance speedup. To achieve load-balanced streamline generation, we propose a workload-aware partitioning algorithm to decompose the vector field into partitions with near equal workloads. Since actual workloads are unknown beforehand, we propose a workload estimation algorithm to predict the workload in the local vector field. A graph-based representation of the vector field is employed to generate these estimates. Once the workloads have been estimated, our partitioning algorithm is hierarchically applied to distribute the workload to all partitions. We examine the performance of our workload estimation and workload-aware partitioning algorithm in several timings studies, which demonstrates that by employing these methods, better scalability can be achieved with little overhead.","article_number":"6064941","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064941","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064941/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064941/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"1785","end_page":"1794","citing_paper_count":44,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":720,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Partitioning algorithms","Cost function","Mathematical model"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Flow visualization","Parallel processing","3D vector field visualization","Streamlines."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.176","title":"BirdVis: Visualizing and Understanding Bird Populations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":50,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Polytechnic Institute of New York University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38018628600","id":38018628600,"full_name":"Nivan Ferreira","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Polytechnic Institute of New York University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Polytechnic Institute of New York University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37682897900","id":37682897900,"full_name":"Lauro Lins","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Polytechnic Institute of New York University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, Cornell University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37410464700","id":37410464700,"full_name":"Daniel Fink","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, Cornell University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, Cornell University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37667188400","id":37667188400,"full_name":"Steve Kelling","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, Cornell University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, Cornell University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088027831","id":37088027831,"full_name":"Christopher Wood","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, Cornell University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Polytechnic Institute of New York University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283149600","id":37283149600,"full_name":"Juliana Freire","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Polytechnic Institute of New York University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Polytechnic Institute of New York University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275249200","id":37275249200,"full_name":"Claudio Silva","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Polytechnic Institute of New York University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Birds are unrivaled windows into biotic processes at all levels and are proven indicators of ecological well-being. Understanding the determinants of species distributions and their dynamics is an important aspect of ecology and is critical for conservation and management. Through crowdsourcing, since 2002, the eBird project has been collecting bird observation records. These observations, together with local-scale environmental covariates such as climate, habitat, and vegetation phenology have been a valuable resource for a global community of educators, land managers, ornithologists, and conservation biologists. By associating environmental inputs with observed patterns of bird occurrence, predictive models have been developed that provide a statistical framework to harness available data for predicting species distributions and making inferences about species-habitat associations. Understanding these models, however, is challenging because they require scientists to quantify and compare multiscale spatialtemporal patterns. A large series of coordinated or sequential plots must be generated, individually programmed, and manually composed for analysis. This hampers the exploration and is a barrier to making the cross-species comparisons that are essential for coordinating conservation and extracting important ecological information. To address these limitations, as part of a collaboration among computer scientists, statisticians, biologists and ornithologists, we have developed BirdVis, an interactive visualization system that supports the analysis of spatio-temporal bird distribution models. BirdVis leverages visualization techniques and uses them in a novel way to better assist users in the exploration of interdependencies among model parameters.

As dynamic networks exhibit different characteristics, e.g., being of sparse or dense structure, or having a continuous or discrete time line, a variety of visualization techniques have been specifically designed to handle these different aspects of network structure and time. This wide range of existing techniques is well justified, as rarely a single visualization is suitable to cover the entire visual analysis. Instead, visual representations are often switched in the course of the exploration of dynamic graphs as the focus of analysis shifts between the temporal and the structural aspects of the data. To support such a switching in a seamless and intuitive manner, we introduce the concept of in situ visualization- a novel strategy that tightly integrates existing visualization techniques for dynamic networks. It does so by allowing the user to interactively select in a base visualization a region for which a different visualization technique is then applied and embedded in the selection made. This permits to change the way a locally selected group of data items, such as nodes or time points, are shown - right in the place where they are positioned, thus supporting the user's overall mental map. Using this approach, a user can switch seamlessly between different visual representations to adapt a region of a base visualization to the specifics of the data within it or to the current analysis focus. This paper presents and discusses the in situ visualization strategy and its implications for dynamic graph visualization. Furthermore, it illustrates its usefulness by employing it for the visual exploration of dynamic networks from two different fields: model versioning and wireless mesh networks.","article_number":"6065000","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065000","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065000/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065000/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"2334","end_page":"2343","citing_paper_count":42,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":1115,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Graphics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Dynamic graph data","multiform visualization","multi-focus+context."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.191","title":"Drawing Road Networks with Focus Regions","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":52,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Science I, University of Würzburg, Wurzburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017278900","id":38017278900,"full_name":"Jan-Henrik Haunert","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science I, University of Würzburg, Wurzburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science I, University of Würzburg, Wurzburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089322264","id":37089322264,"full_name":"Leon Sering","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science I, University of Würzburg, Wurzburg, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Mobile users of maps typically need detailed information about their surroundings plus some context information about remote places. In order to avoid that the map partly gets too dense, cartographers have designed mapping functions that enlarge a user-defined focus region - such functions are sometimes called fish-eye projections. The extra map space occupied by the enlarged focus region is compensated by distorting other parts of the map. We argue that, in a map showing a network of roads relevant to the user, distortion should preferably take place in those areas where the network is sparse. Therefore, we do not apply a predefined mapping function. Instead, we consider the road network as a graph whose edges are the road segments. We compute a new spatial mapping with a graph-based optimization approach, minimizing the square sum of distortions at edges. Our optimization method is based on a convex quadratic program (CQP); CQPs can be solved in polynomial time. Important requirements on the output map are expressed as linear inequalities. In particular, we show how to forbid edge crossings. We have implemented our method in a prototype tool. For instances of different sizes, our method generated output maps that were far less distorted than those generated with a predefined fish-eye projection. Future work is needed to automate the selection of roads relevant to the user. Furthermore, we aim at fast heuristics for application in real-time systems.","article_number":"6065023","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065023","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065023/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065023/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"2555","end_page":"2562","citing_paper_count":40,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":808,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Cartography","Optimization","Image analysis","Visualization","Distortion measurement","Graphics","Quadratic programming"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Cartography","schematic maps","fish-eye view","graph drawing","optimization","quadratic programming."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.173","title":"Automatic Transfer Functions Based on Informational Divergence","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":53,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Girona, Spain","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017257300","id":38017257300,"full_name":"Marc Ruiz","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Girona, Spain"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Girona, Spain","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272788000","id":37272788000,"full_name":"Anton Bardera","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Girona, Spain"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Girona, Spain","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37563064000","id":37563064000,"full_name":"Imma Boada","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Girona, Spain"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Bergen, Norway","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282726800","id":37282726800,"full_name":"Ivan Viola","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Bergen, Norway"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Girona, Spain","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37426689600","id":37426689600,"full_name":"Miquel Feixas","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Girona, Spain"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Girona, Spain","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396572900","id":37396572900,"full_name":"Mateu Sbert","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Girona, Spain"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this paper we present a framework to define transfer functions from a target distribution provided by the user.

In this paper, we propose a novel area-preserving surface parameterization method which is rigorous in theory, moderate in computation, yet easily extendable to surfaces of non-disc and closed-boundary topologies. Starting from the distortion induced by an initial parameterization, an area restoring diffeomorphic flow is constructed as a Lie advection of differential 2-forms along the manifold, which yields equality of the area elements between the domain and the original surface at its final state. Existence and uniqueness of result are assured through an analytical derivation. Based upon a triangulated surface representation, we also present an efficient algorithm in line with discrete differential modeling. As an exemplar application, the utilization of this method for the effective visualization of brain cortical imaging modalities is presented. Compared with conformal methods, our method can reveal more subtle surface patterns in a quantitative manner. It, therefore, provides a competitive alternative to the existing parameterization techniques for better surface-based analysis in various scenarios.","article_number":"6064964","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064964","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064964/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064964/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"2005","end_page":"2014","citing_paper_count":39,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":505,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Vectors","Surface treatment","Geometry","Boundary conditions","Manifolds","Measurement"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Area-preserving surface parameterization","differential forms","Lie advection","surface visualization."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.197","title":"Exploring Uncertainty in Geodemographics with Interactive Graphics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":55,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"City University London, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590960700","id":37590960700,"full_name":"Aidan Slingsby","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["City University London, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"City University London, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37605079900","id":37605079900,"full_name":"Jason Dykes","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["City University London, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"City University London, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399045100","id":37399045100,"full_name":"Jo Wood","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["City University London, UK"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Geodemographic classifiers characterise populations by categorising geographical areas according to the demographic and lifestyle characteristics of those who live within them. The dimension-reducing quality of such classifiers provides a simple and effective means of characterising population through a manageable set of categories, but inevitably hides heterogeneity, which varies within and between the demographic categories and geographical areas, sometimes systematically. This may have implications for their use, which is widespread in government and commerce for planning, marketing and related activities. We use novel interactive graphics to delve into OAC – a free and open geodemographic classifier that classifies the UK population in over 200,000 small geographical areas into 7 super-groups, 21 groups and 52 sub-groups. Our graphics provide access to the original 41 demographic variables used in the classification and the uncertainty associated with the classification of each geographical area on-demand. It also supports comparison geographically and by category. This serves the dual purpose of helping understand the classifier itself leading to its more informed use and providing a more comprehensive view of population in a comprehensible manner. We assess the impact of these interactive graphics on experienced OAC users who explored the details of the classification, its uncertainty and the nature of between – and within – class variation and then reflect on their experiences. Visualization of the complexities and subtleties of the classification proved to be a thought-provoking exercise both confirming and challenging usersâ€šÃ„Ã´ understanding of population, the OAC classifier and the way it is used in their organisations. Users identified three contexts for which the techniques were deemed useful in the context of local government, confirming the validity of the proposed methods.","article_number":"6065022","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065022","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065022/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065022/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"2545","end_page":"2554","citing_paper_count":38,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":1301,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Demographics","Image color analysis","Visualization","Data visualization","Classification"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Geodemographics","OAC","classification","cartography","uncertainty."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.246","title":"TransGraph: Hierarchical Exploration of Transition Relationships in Time-Varying Volumetric Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":56,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38021343000","id":38021343000,"full_name":"Yi Gu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37405886900","id":37405886900,"full_name":"Chaoli Wang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"A fundamental challenge for time-varying volume data analysis and visualization is the lack of capability to observe and track data change or evolution in an occlusion-free, controllable, and adaptive fashion.

Such data is often generated to meet specific needs or certain conditions that may not be easily found in the original, real data. The nature of the data varies according to the application area and includes text, graphs, social or weather data, among many others. The common process to create such synthetic datasets is to implement small scripts or programs, restricted to small problems or to a specific application. In this paper we propose a framework designed to generate high dimensional datasets. Users can interactively create and navigate through multi dimensional datasets using a suitable graphical user-interface. The data creation is driven by statistical distributions based on a few user-defined parameters.

Furthermore, our framework supports the creation of complex non-orthogonal trends and classified datasets.

Even though computers are continually getting faster, it remains a challenge to incorporate sophisticated illumination models into direct volume rendering while maintaining interactive frame rates. In this paper, we present a novel approach for advanced illumination in direct volume rendering based on GPU ray-casting. Our approach features directional soft shadows taking scattering into account, ambient occlusion and color bleeding effects while achieving very competitive frame rates. In particular, multiple dynamic lights and interactive transfer function changes are fully supported. Commonly, direct volume rendering is based on a very simplified discrete version of the original volume rendering integral, including the development of the original exponential extinction into a-blending. In contrast to a-blending forming a product when sampling along a ray, the original exponential extinction coefficient is an integral and its discretization a Riemann sum. The fact that it is a sum can cleverly be exploited to implement volume lighting effects, i.e. soft directional shadows, ambient occlusion and color bleeding. We will show how this can be achieved and how it can be implemented on the GPU.","article_number":"6064942","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064942","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064942/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064942/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"1795","end_page":"1802","citing_paper_count":35,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1019,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Light sources","Scattering","Image color analysis","Graphics processing unit"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Volume Rendering","Shadows","Ambient Occlusion","GPU Ray-Casting","Exponential Extinction."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.212","title":"Improved Similarity Trees and their Application to Visual Data Classification","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":61,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Federal University of Uberlândia and ICMC, Brazil","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38287494800","id":38287494800,"full_name":"Jose Gustavo Paiva","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Federal University of Uberlândia and ICMC, Brazil"]}},{"affiliation":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SÃ£o Paulo, BR","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087869588","id":37087869588,"full_name":"Laura Florian","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SÃ£o Paulo, BR"]}},{"affiliation":"IC-University of Campinas, Brazil","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294758000","id":37294758000,"full_name":"Helio Pedrini","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IC-University of Campinas, Brazil"]}},{"affiliation":"IC-University of Campinas, Brazil","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38331135000","id":38331135000,"full_name":"Guilherme Telles","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IC-University of Campinas, Brazil"]}},{"affiliation":"ICMC-University of São Paulo, Brazil","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37371567600","id":37371567600,"full_name":"Rosane Minghim","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["ICMC-University of São Paulo, Brazil"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"An alternative form to multidimensional projections for the visual analysis of data represented in multidimensional spaces is the deployment of similarity trees, such as Neighbor Joining trees. They organize data objects on the visual plane emphasizing their levels of similarity with high capability of detecting and separating groups and subgroups of objects. Besides this similarity-based hierarchical data organization, some of their advantages include the ability to decrease point clutter; high precision; and a consistent view of the data set during focusing, offering a very intuitive way to view the general structure of the data set as well as to drill down to groups and subgroups of interest. Disadvantages of similarity trees based on neighbor joining strategies include their computational cost and the presence of virtual nodes that utilize too much of the visual space. This paper presents a highly improved version of the similarity tree technique. The improvements in the technique are given by two procedures. The first is a strategy that replaces virtual nodes by promoting real leaf nodes to their place, saving large portions of space in the display and maintaining the expressiveness and precision of the technique. The second improvement is an implementation that significantly accelerates the algorithm, impacting its use for larger data sets. We also illustrate the applicability of the technique in visual data mining, showing its advantages to support visual classification of data sets, with special attention to the case of image classification. We demonstrate the capabilities of the tree for analysis and iterative manipulation and employ those capabilities to support evolving to a satisfactory data organization and classification.","article_number":"6065013","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065013","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065013/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065013/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"2459","end_page":"2468","citing_paper_count":34,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1433,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image classification","Data visualization","Phylogeny","Biomedical image processing","Algorithm design and analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Similarity Trees","Multidimensional Projections","Image Classification."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.225","title":"Nodes on Ropes: A Comprehensive Data and Control Flow for Steering Ensemble Simulations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":62,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"VRVis Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38111592300","id":38111592300,"full_name":"Jurgen Waser","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VRVis Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"VRVis Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38580356000","id":38580356000,"full_name":"Hrvoje Ribicic","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VRVis Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"ETH Zürich, Switzerland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38099765400","id":38099765400,"full_name":"Raphael Fuchs","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["ETH Zürich, Switzerland"]}},{"affiliation":"VRVis Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37408064900","id":37408064900,"full_name":"Christian Hirsch","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VRVis Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"ETH Zürich, Switzerland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38102461400","id":38102461400,"full_name":"Benjamin Schindler","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["ETH Zürich, Switzerland"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38229402400","id":38229402400,"full_name":"Gunther Bloschl","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284271200","id":37284271200,"full_name":"Eduard Groller","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Vienna, Austria"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Flood disasters are the most common natural risk and tremendous efforts are spent to improve their simulation and management. However, simulation-based investigation of actions that can be taken in case of flood emergencies is rarely done. This is in part due to the lack of a comprehensive framework which integrates and facilitates these efforts. In this paper, we tackle several problems which are related to steering a flood simulation. One issue is related to uncertainty. We need to account for uncertain knowledge about the environment, such as levee-breach locations. Furthermore, the steering process has to reveal how these uncertainties in the boundary conditions affect the confidence in the simulation outcome. Another important problem is that the simulation setup is often hidden in a black-box. We expose system internals and show that simulation steering can be comprehensible at the same time. This is important because the domain expert needs to be able to modify the simulation setup in order to include local knowledge and experience. In the proposed solution, users steer parameter studies through the World Lines interface to account for input uncertainties. The transport of steering information to the underlying data-flow components is handled by a novel meta-flow. The meta-flow is an extension to a standard data-flow network, comprising additional nodes and ropes to abstract parameter control. The meta-flow has a visual representation to inform the user about which control operations happen. Finally, we present the idea to use the data-flow diagram itself for visualizing steering information and simulation results. We discuss a case-study in collaboration with a domain expert who proposes different actions to protect a virtual city from imminent flooding. The key to choosing the best response strategy is the ability to compare different regions of the parameter space while retaining an understanding of what is happening inside the data-flow system.","article_number":"6064950","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064950","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064950/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064950/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"1872","end_page":"1881","citing_paper_count":33,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":783,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Navigation","Disaster management","Control systems","Emergency services","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Emergency/Disaster Management","Visual Knowledge Discovery","Visualization System and Toolkit Design","Data-Flow","Meta-Flow","Parameter Study","Uncertainty","Visualization of Control."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.163","title":"Adaptive Privacy-Preserving Visualization Using Parallel Coordinates","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":63,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"UNC-Charlotte, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593202500","id":37593202500,"full_name":"Aritra Dasgupta","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UNC-Charlotte, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"UNC-Charlotte, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282563400","id":37282563400,"full_name":"Robert Kosara","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UNC-Charlotte, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Current information visualization techniques assume unrestricted access to data.

Researchers in the field of data mining have proposed different techniques over the years for privacy-preserving data publishing and subsequent mining techniques on such sanitized data. A well-known drawback in these methods is that for even a small guarantee of privacy, the utility of the datasets is greatly reduced. In this paper, we propose an adaptive technique for privacy preser vation in parallel coordinates. Based on knowledge about the sensitivity of the data, we compute a clustered representation on the fly, which allows the user to explore the data without breaching privacy.

Therefore, an elaborate analysis of the blood-flow in heart and thoracic arteries is essential. Contemporary MRI techniques enable acquisition of quantitative time-resolved flow information, resulting in 4D velocity fields that capture the blood-flow behavior. Visual exploration of these fields provides comprehensive insight into the unsteady blood-flow behavior, and precedes a quantitative analysis of additional blood-flow parameters. The complete inspection requires accurate segmentation of anatomical structures, encompassing a time-consuming and hard-to-automate process, especially for malformed morphologies. We present a way to avoid the laborious segmentation process in case of qualitative inspection, by introducing an interactive virtual probe. This probe is positioned semi-automatically within the blood-flow field, and serves as a navigational object for visual exploration. The difficult task of determining position and orientation along the view-direction is automated by a fitting approach, aligning the probe with the orientations of the velocity field. The aligned probe provides an interactive seeding basis for various flow visualization approaches. We demonstrate illustration-inspired particles, integral lines and integral surfaces, conveying distinct characteristics of the unsteady blood-flow. Lastly, we present the results of an evaluation with domain experts, valuing the practical use of our probe and flow visualization techniques.","article_number":"6064980","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064980","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064980/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064980/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"2153","end_page":"2162","citing_paper_count":32,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":752,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Magnetic resonance imaging","Blood flow","Three dimensional displays","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Probing","Flow visualization","Illustrative visualization","Multivalued images","Phase-contrast cine MRI."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.232","title":"Sequence Surveyor: Leveraging Overview for Scalable Genomic Alignment Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":65,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38019392100","id":38019392100,"full_name":"Danielle Albers","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37994248400","id":37994248400,"full_name":"Colin Dewey","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282585700","id":37282585700,"full_name":"Michael Gleicher","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce overview visualization tools for large-scale multiple genome alignment data.

Researchers in application domains such as engineering, computational biology, climate study, imaging and motion capture are faced with the problem of how to discover compact representations of highdimensional data while preserving their intrinsic structure. In many applications, the original data is projected onto low-dimensional space via dimensionality reduction techniques prior to modeling. One problem with this approach is that the projection step in the process can fail to preserve structure in the data that is only apparent in high dimensions. Conversely, such techniques may create structural illusions in the projection, implying structure not present in the original high-dimensional data. Our solution is to utilize topological techniques to recover important structures in high-dimensional data that contains non-trivial topology. Specifically, we are interested in high-dimensional branching structures. We construct local circle-valued coordinate functions to represent such features. Subsequently, we perform dimensionality reduction on the data while ensuring such structures are visually preserved. Additionally, we study the effects of global circular structures on visualizations. Our results reveal never-before-seen structures on real-world data sets from a variety of applications.","article_number":"6064953","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064953","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064953/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064953/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"1902","end_page":"1911","citing_paper_count":31,"citing_patent_count":2,"download_count":756,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Topology","Algorithm design and analysis","Feature extraction","Approximation methods"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Dimensionality reduction","circular coordinates","visualization","topological analysis."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.174","title":"BallotMaps: Detecting Name Bias in Alphabetically Ordered Ballot Papers","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":67,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"GiCentre, School of Informatics, City University London, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399045100","id":37399045100,"full_name":"Jo Wood","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["GiCentre, School of Informatics, City University London, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"GiCentre, School of Informatics, City University London, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017330600","id":38017330600,"full_name":"Donia Badawood","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["GiCentre, School of Informatics, City University London, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"GiCentre, School of Informatics, City University London, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37605079900","id":37605079900,"full_name":"Jason Dykes","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["GiCentre, School of Informatics, City University London, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"GiCentre, School of Informatics, City University London, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590960700","id":37590960700,"full_name":"Aidan Slingsby","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["GiCentre, School of Informatics, City University London, UK"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The relationship between candidates' position on a ballot paper and vote rank is explored in the case of 5000 candidates for the UK 2010 local government elections in the Greater London area. This design study uses hierarchical spatially arranged graphics to represent two locations that affect candidates at very different scales: the geographical areas for which they seek election and the spatial location of their names on the ballot paper. This approach allows the effect of position bias to be assessed; that is, the degree to which the position of a candidate's name on the ballot paper influences the number of votes received by the candidate, and whether this varies geographically. Results show that position bias was significant enough to influence rank order of candidates, and in the case of many marginal electoral wards, to influence who was elected to government. Position bias was observed most strongly for Liberal Democrat candidates but present for all major political parties. Visual analysis of classification of candidate names by ethnicity suggests that this too had an effect on votes received by candidates, in some cases overcoming alphabetic name bias. The results found contradict some earlier research suggesting that alphabetic name bias was not sufficiently significant to affect electoral outcome and add new evidence for the geographic and ethnicity influences on voting behaviour. The visual approach proposed here can be applied to a wider range of electoral data and the patterns identified and hypotheses derived from them could have significant implications for the design of ballot papers and the conduct of fair elections.","article_number":"6065005","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6065005","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065005/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065005/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"2384","end_page":"2391","citing_paper_count":30,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":983,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Nominations and elections","Data visualization","Local government","Image color analysis","Geospatial analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Voting","election","bias","democracy","governance","treemaps","geovisualization","hierarchy","governance."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.260","title":"Vortex Visualization in Ultra Low Reynolds Number Insect Flight","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":68,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"College of Engineering and Computer Science, Wright State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37665393300","id":37665393300,"full_name":"Christopher Koehler","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Engineering and Computer Science, Wright State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Engineering and Computer Science, Wright State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282584400","id":37282584400,"full_name":"Thomas Wischgoll","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Engineering and Computer Science, Wright State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Wright State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37836660700","id":37836660700,"full_name":"Haibo Dong","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Wright State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"College of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Wright State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017003700","id":38017003700,"full_name":"Zachary Gaston","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["College of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Wright State University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present the visual analysis of a biologically inspired CFD simulation of the deformable flapping wings of a dragonfly as it takes off and begins to maneuver, using vortex detection and integration-based flow lines. The additional seed placement and perceptual challenges introduced by having multiple dynamically deforming objects in the highly unsteady 3D flow domain are addressed. A brief overview of the high speed photogrammetry setup used to capture the dragonfly takeoff, parametric surfaces used for wing reconstruction, CFD solver and underlying flapping flight theory is presented to clarify the importance of several unsteady flight mechanisms, such as the leading edge vortex, that are captured visually. A novel interactive seed placement method is used to simplify the generation of seed curves that stay in the vicinity of relevant flow phenomena as they move with the flapping wings. This method allows a user to define and evaluate the quality of a seed's trajectory over time while working with a single time step. The seed curves are then used to place particles, streamlines and generalized streak lines. The novel concept of flowing seeds is also introduced in order to add visual context about the instantaneous vector fields surrounding smoothly animate streak lines. Tests show this method to be particularly effective at visually capturing vortices that move quickly or that exist for a very brief period of time. In addition, an automatic camera animation method is used to address occlusion issues caused when animating the immersed wing boundaries alongside many geometric flow lines. Each visualization method is presented at multiple time steps during the up-stroke and down-stroke to highlight the formation, attachment and shedding of the leading edge vortices in pairs of wings. Also, the visualizations show evidence of wake capture at stroke reversal which suggests the existence of previously unknown unsteady lift generation mechanisms that are unique to quad wing insects.","article_number":"6064971","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064971","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064971/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064971/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"2071","end_page":"2079","citing_paper_count":28,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1185,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three dimensional displays","Trajectory","Data visualization","Flow visualization","Insects","Feature extraction"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Flow visualization","flowing seed points","streak lines","streamlines","insect flight","vortex visualization","unsteady flow."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.235","title":"Straightening Tubular Flow for Side-by-Side Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":69,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Norway","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37889160600","id":37889160600,"full_name":"Paolo Angelelli","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Norway"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Norway","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274158800","id":37274158800,"full_name":"Helwig Hauser","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Norway"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Flows through tubular structures are common in many fields, including blood flow in medicine and tubular fluid flows in engineering.

This paper focuses on challenges (b) and (c). In particular, we present a framework for hierarchical event representation, and an importance-based selection algorithm for supporting the creation of a video storyboard from a video. We consider the storyboard to be an event summarization for the whole video, whilst each individual illustration on the board is also an event summarization but for a smaller time window. We utilized a 3D visualization template for depicting and annotating events in illustrations. To demonstrate the concepts and algorithms developed, we use Snooker video visualization as a case study, because it has a concrete and agreeable set of semantic definitions for events and can make use of existing techniques of event detection and 3D reconstruction in a reliable manner. Nevertheless, most of our concepts and algorithms developed for challenges (b) and (c) can be applied to other application areas.","article_number":"6064937","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064937","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064937/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064937/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"1747","end_page":"1756","citing_paper_count":28,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":763,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Multimedia communication","Data visualization","Semantics","Context","Three dimensional displays","Time series analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Multimedia visualization","Time series data","Illustrative visualization."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.231","title":"Saliency-Assisted Navigation of Very Large Landscape Images","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":71,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586231900","id":37586231900,"full_name":"Cheuk Yiu Ip","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282560200","id":37282560200,"full_name":"Amitabh Varshney","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The field of visualization has addressed navigation of very large datasets, usually meshes and volumes. Significantly less attention has been devoted to the issues surrounding navigation of very large images. In the last few years the explosive growth in the resolution of camera sensors and robotic image acquisition techniques has widened the gap between the display and image resolutions to three orders of magnitude or more. This paper presents the first steps towards navigation of very large images, particularly landscape images, from an interactive visualization perspective. The grand challenge in navigation of very large images is identifying regions of potential interest. In this paper we outline a three-step approach. In the first step we use multi-scale saliency to narrow down the potential areas of interest. In the second step we outline a method based on statistical signatures to further cull out regions of high conformity. In the final step we allow a user to interactively identify the exceptional regions of high interest that merit further attention. We show that our approach of progressive elicitation is fast and allows rapid identification of regions of interest. Unlike previous work in this area, our approach is scalable and computationally reasonable on very large images. We validate the results of our approach by comparing them to user-tagged regions of interest on several very large landscape images from the Internet.","article_number":"6064936","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064936","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064936/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064936/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"1737","end_page":"1746","citing_paper_count":26,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":687,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Image color analysis","Navigation","Image resolution"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Image Saliency","Very Large Scale Images","Scene Perception","Interactive Visualization","Anomaly Detection","Guided Interaction."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.236","title":"Symmetry in Scalar Field Topology","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":72,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Automation, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38258503300","id":38258503300,"full_name":"Dilip Mathew Thomas","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Automation, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science and Automation, and Supercomputer Education Research Centre, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37278509300","id":37278509300,"full_name":"Vijay Natarajan","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Automation, and Supercomputer Education Research Centre, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Study of symmetric or repeating patterns in scalar fields is important in scientific data analysis because it gives deep insights into the properties of the underlying phenomenon.

We propose a computationally efficient algorithm for detecting symmetric patterns in a scalar field distribution by analysing the topology of level sets of the scalar field. Our algorithm computes the contour tree of a given scalar field and identifies subtrees that are similar. We define a robust similarity measure for comparing subtrees of the contour tree and use it to group similar subtrees together. Regions of the domain corresponding to subtrees that belong to a common group are extracted and reported to be symmetric. Identifying symmetry in scalar fields finds applications in visualization, data exploration, and feature detection.

Although volume ray-casting is widely accepted as the volume rendering technique which achieves the highest image quality, so far no volumetric illumination algorithm has been designed to be directly incorporated into the ray-casting process. In this paper we propose image plane sweep volume illumination (IPSVI), which allows the integration of advanced illumination effects into a GPU-based volume ray-caster by exploiting the plane sweep paradigm. Thus, we are able to reduce the problem complexity and achieve interactive frame rates, while supporting scattering as well as shadowing. Since all illumination computations are performed directly within a single rendering pass, IPSVI does not require any preprocessing nor does it need to store intermediate results within an illumination volume. It therefore has a significantly lower memory footprint than other techniques. This makes IPSVI directly applicable to large data sets. Furthermore, the integration into a GPU-based ray-caster allows for high image quality as well as improved rendering performance by exploiting early ray termination. This paper discusses the theory behind IPSVI, describes its implementation, demonstrates its visual results and provides performance measurements.","article_number":"6064977","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064977","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064977/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064977/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"2125","end_page":"2134","citing_paper_count":22,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":759,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Light sources","Mathematical model","Equations","Synchronization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Interactive volume rendering","GPU-based ray-casting","Advanced illumination."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.159","title":"A Scale Space Based Persistence Measure for Critical Points in 2D Scalar Fields","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":76,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590998600","id":37590998600,"full_name":"Jan Reininghaus","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Technische Universitat Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Rheinland-Pfalz, DE","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233218800","id":38233218800,"full_name":"Natallia Kotava","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technische Universitat Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Rheinland-Pfalz, DE"]}},{"affiliation":"Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087448816","id":37087448816,"full_name":"David Guenther","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38028453100","id":38028453100,"full_name":"Jens Kasten","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Kaiserslautern, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282578800","id":37282578800,"full_name":"Hans Hagen","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Kaiserslautern, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282721800","id":37282721800,"full_name":"Ingrid Hotz","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"This paper introduces a novel importance measure for critical points in 2D scalar fields.

To demonstrate the practical relevance of our method we apply it to a synthetic and a real-world data set and evaluate its performance and scalability.","article_number":"6064968","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064968","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064968/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064968/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"2045","end_page":"2052","citing_paper_count":22,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":502,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Feature extraction","Noise measurement","Noise robustness","Laplace equations","Scalability"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Scale space","persistence","discrete Morse theory."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.170","title":"Asymmetric Tensor Field Visualization for Surfaces","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":77,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"SCI, University of Utah, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087942878","id":37087942878,"full_name":"Darrel Palke","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SCI, University of Utah, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Oregon State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37897252000","id":37897252000,"full_name":"Zhongzang Lin","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oregon State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Oregon State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37069800000","id":37069800000,"full_name":"Guoning Chen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oregon State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Oregon State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37889942300","id":37889942300,"full_name":"Harry Yeh","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oregon State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Oregon State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38024282800","id":38024282800,"full_name":"Paul Vincent","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oregon State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Swansea University, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267247900","id":37267247900,"full_name":"Robert Laramee","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Swansea University, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Oregon State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37398562200","id":37398562200,"full_name":"Eugene Zhang","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Oregon State University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Asymmetric tensor field visualization can provide important insight into fluid flows and solid deformations. Existing techniques for asymmetric tensor fields focus on the analysis, and simply use evenly-spaced hyperstreamlines on surfaces following eigenvectors and dual-eigenvectors in the tensor field. In this paper, we describe a hybrid visualization technique in which hyperstreamlines and elliptical glyphs are used in real and complex domains, respectively. This enables a more faithful representation of flow behaviors inside complex domains. In addition, we encode tensor magnitude, an important quantity in tensor field analysis, using the density of hyperstreamlines and sizes of glyphs. This allows colors to be used to encode other important tensor quantities. To facilitate quick visual exploration of the data from different viewpoints and at different resolutions, we employ an efficient image-space approach in which hyperstreamlines and glyphs are generated quickly in the image plane. The combination of these techniques leads to an efficient tensor field visualization system for domain scientists. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our visualization technique through applications to complex simulated engine fluid flow and earthquake deformation data.

These grids are composed of polyhedra that often are non-convex and have an arbitrary number of faces, where the faces can be non-planar with an arbitrary number of vertices. The importance of such grids in state-of-the-art simulation packages is increasing rapidly. We propose a very compact, face-based data structure for representing such meshes for visualization, called two-sided face sequence lists (TSFSL), as well as an algorithm for direct GPU-based ray-casting using this representation. The TSFSL data structure is able to represent the entire mesh topology in a 1D TSFSL data array of face records, which facilitates the use of efficient 1D texture accesses for visualization. In order to scale to large data sizes, we employ a mesh decomposition into bricks that can be handled independently, where each brick is then composed of its own TSFSL array. This bricking enables memory savings and performance improvements for large meshes. We illustrate the feasibility of our approach with real-world application results, by visualizing highly complex polyhedral data from commercial state-of-the-art simulation packages.","article_number":"6064976","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064976","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064976/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064976/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"2115","end_page":"2124","citing_paper_count":20,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":627,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Geometry","Rendering (computer graphics)","Data visualization","Graphics processing unit"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Volume rendering","unstructured grids","polyhedral grids","GPU-based visualization."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.167","title":"Arc Length-Based Aspect Ratio Selection","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":79,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Stanford University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604514900","id":37604514900,"full_name":"Justin Talbot","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Stanford University"]}},{"affiliation":"Stanford University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37840462500","id":37840462500,"full_name":"John Gerth","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Stanford University"]}},{"affiliation":"Stanford University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349803800","id":37349803800,"full_name":"Pat Hanrahan","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Stanford University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The aspect ratio of a plot has a dramatic impact on our ability to perceive trends and patterns in the data.

This paper is concerned with the effective visualization and precise topological analysis of area-preserving maps with two degrees of freedom from numerical or analytical data.

Furthermore, we show how to estimate the extent of connected safe areas to improve common medical 2D multi-planar reconstruction (MPR) views. We evaluate our method by means of expert interviews, an online survey, and a retrospective evaluation of 19 real abdominal radio-frequency ablation (RFA) interventions, with expert decisions serving as a gold standard. The evaluation results show clear evidence that our method can be successfully applied in clinical practice without introducing substantial overhead work for the acting personnel.

Examples of this application scenario are connectors or housings with metal inlays in the electronic or automotive industry. A major problem of this type of components is the presence of metal, which causes streaking artifacts and distorts the surrounding media in the reconstructed volume. Streaking artifacts and dark-band artifacts around metal components significantly influence the material characterization (especially for the plastic components). In specific cases these artifacts even prevent a further analysis. Due to the nature and the different characteristics of artifacts, the development of an efficient artifact-reduction technique in reconstruction-space is rather complicated. In this paper we present a projection-space pipeline for metal-artifacts reduction. The proposed technique first segments the metal in the spatial domain of the reconstructed volume in order to separate it from the other materials. Then metal parts are forward-projected on the set of projections in a way that metal-projection regions are treated as voids. Subsequently the voids, which are left by the removed metal, are interpolated in the 2D projections. Finally, the metal is inserted back into the reconstructed 3D volume during the fusion stage. We present a visual analysis tool, allowing for interactive parameter estimation of the metal segmentation. The results of the proposed artifact-reduction technique are demonstrated on a test part as well as on real world components. For these specimens we achieve a significant reduction of metal artifacts, allowing an enhanced material characterization.","article_number":"6064984","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064984","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064984/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064984/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"2193","end_page":"2202","citing_paper_count":18,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1044,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three dimensional displays","Image reconstruction","Computed tomography","Interpolation","Information analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Metal-artifact reduction","multi-material components","visual analysis","3D X-ray computed tomography."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.218","title":"iView: A Feature Clustering Framework for Suggesting Informative Views in Volume Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":83,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Visual Analytics and Imaging (VAI) Laboratory, Center for Visual Computing, Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37599599100","id":37599599100,"full_name":"Ziyi Zheng","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Analytics and Imaging (VAI) Laboratory, Center for Visual Computing, Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Visual Analytics and Imaging (VAI) Laboratory, Center for Visual Computing, Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38021380500","id":38021380500,"full_name":"Nafees Ahmed","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Analytics and Imaging (VAI) Laboratory, Center for Visual Computing, Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Visual Analytics and Imaging (VAI) Laboratory, Center for Visual Computing, Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273119700","id":37273119700,"full_name":"Klaus Mueller","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Visual Analytics and Imaging (VAI) Laboratory, Center for Visual Computing, Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The unguided visual exploration of volumetric data can be both a challenging and a time-consuming undertaking.

Recent research efforts have focused on entropy-based viewpoint selection criteria that depend on scalar values describing the structures of interest. In contrast, we propose a viewpoint suggestion pipeline that is based on feature-clustering in high-dimensional space. We use gradient/normal variation as a metric to identify interesting local events and then cluster these via k-means to detect important salient composite features. Next, we compute the maximum possible exposure of these composite feature for different viewpoints and calculate a 2D entropy map parameterized in longitude and latitude to point out promising view orientations. Superimposed onto an interactive track-ball interface, users can then directly use this entropy map to quickly navigate to potentially interesting viewpoints where visibility-based transfer functions can be employed to generate volume renderings that minimize occlusions. To give full exploration freedom to the user, the entropy map is updated on the fly whenever a view has been selected, pointing to new and promising but so far unseen view directions. Alternatively, our system can also use a set-cover optimization algorithm to provide a minimal set of views needed to observe all features. The views so generated could then be saved into a list for further inspection or into a gallery for a summary presentation.","article_number":"6064959","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064959","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064959/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064959/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"1959","end_page":"1968","citing_paper_count":16,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":787,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Transfer functions","Entropy","Rendering (computer graphics)","Feature extraction","Clustering algorithms"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Direct volume rendering","k-means","entropy","view suggestion","set-cover problem","ant colony optimization."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.187","title":"Developing and Evaluating Quilts for the Depiction of Large Layered Graphs","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":84,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"NC State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37595934400","id":37595934400,"full_name":"Juhee Bae","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["NC State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"North Carolina State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37356872100","id":37356872100,"full_name":"Benjamin Watson","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["North Carolina State University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Traditional layered graph depictions such as flow charts are in wide use.

In our second study, we compare Quilts using the mixed depiction to node-link diagrams and centered matrices. Overall results show that users can find paths through graphs significantly faster with Quilts (46.6 secs) than with node-link (58.3 secs) or matrix (71.2 secs) diagrams.

We designed a task, trend localization, that required comparison of multiple data values in a multi-variate visualization. We then conducted a user study with this task, evaluating five multivariate visualization techniques from the literature (Brush Strokes, Data-Driven Spots, Oriented Slivers, Color Blending, Dimensional Stacking) and juxtaposed grayscale maps. We report the results and discuss the implications for both the techniques and the task.","article_number":"6064969","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064969","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064969/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064969/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"2053","end_page":"2062","citing_paper_count":12,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":598,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Image color analysis","Data visualization","Gray-scale","Shape analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["User study","multi-variate visualization","visual task design","visual analytics."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.164","title":"An Efficient Direct Volume Rendering Approach for Dichromats","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":86,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Laboratory of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38024756400","id":38024756400,"full_name":"Weifeng Chen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Laboratory of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Laboratory of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37291847800","id":37291847800,"full_name":"Wei Chen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Laboratory of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Laboratory of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271755400","id":37271755400,"full_name":"Hujun Bao","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Laboratory of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Color vision deficiency (CVD) affects a high percentage of the population worldwide. When seeing a volume visualization result, persons with CVD may be incapable of discriminating the classification information expressed in the image if the color transfer function or the color blending used in the direct volume rendering is not appropriate. Conventional methods used to address this problem adopt advanced image recoloring techniques to enhance the rendering results frame-by-frame; unfortunately, problematic perceptual results may still be generated. This paper proposes an alternative solution that complements the image recoloring scheme by reconfiguring the components of the direct volume rendering (DVR) pipeline. Our approach optimizes the mapped colors of a transfer function to simulate CVD-friendly effect that is generated by applying the image recoloring to the results with the initial transfer function. The optimization process has a low computational complexity, and only needs to be performed once for a given transfer function. To achieve detail-preserving and perceptually natural semi-transparent effects, we introduce a new color composition mode that works in the color space of dichromats. Experimental results and a pilot study demonstrates that our approach can yield dichromats-friendly and consistent volume visualization in real-time.","article_number":"6064979","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064979","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064979/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064979/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"2144","end_page":"2152","citing_paper_count":12,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":762,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image color analysis","Transfer functions","Data visualization","Volume measurement","Linear systems","Rendering (computer graphics)"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Dichromacy","direct volume rendering","volume classification","image recoloring."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.252","title":"Visualization of AMR Data With Multi-Level Dual-Mesh Interpolation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":87,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"NASA Ames Research Center, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37264891100","id":37264891100,"full_name":"Patrick Moran","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["NASA Ames Research Center, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Sciences Corporation, NASA Ames, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282594500","id":37282594500,"full_name":"David Ellsworth","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Sciences Corporation, NASA Ames, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present a new technique for providing interpolation within cell-centered Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) data that achieves C0 continuity throughout the 3D domain.

The most advanced imaging technique is robot-driven multi-parameter fluorescence microscopy. This technique is capable of co-mapping hundreds of proteins and their distribution and assembly in protein clusters across a cell or tissue sample by running cycles of fluorescence tagging with monoclonal antibodies or other affinity reagents, imaging, and bleaching in situ. The imaging results in complex multi-parameter data composed of one slice or a 3D volume per affinity reagent. Biologists are particularly interested in the localization of co-occurring proteins, the frequency of co-occurrence and the distribution of co-occurring proteins across the cell. We present an interactive visual analysis approach for the evaluation of multi-parameter fluorescence microscopy data in toponomics. Multiple, linked views facilitate the definition of features by brushing multiple dimensions. The feature specification result is linked to all views establishing a focus+context visualization in 3D. In a new attribute view, we integrate techniques from graph visualization. Each node in the graph represents an affinity reagent while each edge represents two co-occurring affinity reagent bindings. The graph visualization is enhanced by glyphs which encode specific properties of the binding. The graph view is equipped with brushing facilities. By brushing in the spatial and attribute domain, the biologist achieves a better understanding of the function protein patterns of a cell. Furthermore, an interactive table view is integrated which summarizes unique fluorescence patterns. We discuss our approach with respect to a cell probe containing lymphocytes and a prostate tissue section.","article_number":"6064951","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064951","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064951/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064951/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"1882","end_page":"1891","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":730,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Microscopy","Fluorescence","Graphics","Three dimensional displays","Biological information theory","Image color analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analytics","Fluorescence Microscopy","Toponomics","Protein Interaction","Graph Visualization."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.242","title":"The Effect of Colour and Transparency on the Perception of Overlaid Grids","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":89,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Simon Fraser University, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37353447100","id":37353447100,"full_name":"Lyn Bartram","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Simon Fraser University, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"Simon Fraser University, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38027547900","id":38027547900,"full_name":"Billy Cheung","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Simon Fraser University, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"Simon Fraser University, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37376130500","id":37376130500,"full_name":"Maureen Stone","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Simon Fraser University, Canada"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Overlaid reference elements need to be sufficiently visible to effectively relate to the underlying information, but not so obtrusive that they clutter the presentation.

Previous work discovered a useful range of alpha values for black or white grids overlayed on scatterplot images rendered in shades of gray over gray backgrounds of different lightness values. This work compares black grids to blue and red ones on different image types of scatterplots and maps. We expected that the coloured grids over grayscale images would be more visually salient than black ones, resulting in lower alpha values. Instead, we found that there was no significant difference between the boundaries set for red and black grids, but that the boundaries for blue grids were set consistently higher (more opaque). As in our previous study, alpha values are affected by image density rather than image type, and are consistently lower than many default settings. These results have implications for the design of subtle reference structures.","article_number":"6064957","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064957","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064957/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064957/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"1942","end_page":"1948","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":907,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image color analysis","Complexity theory","Educational institutions","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Information visualization","automated presentation","applied perception","visual design","computational aesthetics."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.182","title":"Context Preserving Maps of Tubular Structures","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":90,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37605959300","id":37605959300,"full_name":"Joseph Marino","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37393948000","id":37393948000,"full_name":"Wei Zeng","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37276603700","id":37276603700,"full_name":"Xianfeng Gu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268052800","id":37268052800,"full_name":"Arie Kaufman","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"When visualizing tubular 3D structures, external representations are often used for guidance and display, and such views in 2D can often contain occlusions. Virtual dissection methods have been proposed where the entire 3D structure can be mapped to the 2D plane, though these will lose context by straightening curved sections. We present a new method of creating maps of 3D tubular structures that yield a succinct view while preserving the overall geometric structure. Given a dominant view plane for the structure, its curve skeleton is first projected to a 2D skeleton. This 2D skeleton is adjusted to account for distortions in length, modified to remove intersections, and optimized to preserve the shape of the original 3D skeleton. Based on this shaped 2D skeleton, a boundary for the map of the object is obtained based on a slicing path through the structure and the radius around the skeleton. The sliced structure is conformally mapped to a rectangle and then deformed via harmonic mapping to match the boundary placement. This flattened map preserves the general geometric context of a 3D object in a 2D display, and rendering of this flattened map can be accomplished using volumetric ray casting. We have evaluated our method on real datasets of human colon models.","article_number":"6064963","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064963","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064963/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064963/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6064926,"publication_year":2011,"publication_date":"Dec. 2011","start_page":"1997","end_page":"2004","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":472,"insert_date":"20111103","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three dimensional displays","Volume measurement","Shape analysis","Geometry","Navigation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Geometry-based technique","volume rendering","biomedical visualization","medical visualization","conformal mapping."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.204","title":"FoamVis: Visualization of 2D Foam Simulation Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":91,"volume":"17","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Swansea University, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088135314","id":37088135314,"full_name":"Dan Lipsa","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Swansea University, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Swansea University, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267247900","id":37267247900,"full_name":"Robert Laramee","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Swansea University, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Aberystwyth University, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088135909","id":37088135909,"full_name":"Simon Cox","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Aberystwyth University, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Aberystwyth University, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088137308","id":37088137308,"full_name":"Tudur Davies","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Aberystwyth University, UK"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Research in the field of complex fluids such as polymer solutions, particulate suspensions and foams studies how the flow of fluids with different material parameters changes as a result of various constraints.

Visual thinking uses picture-like representations as internal mental models or as external depictions such as diagrams. The first part of the talk will analyze the role of visual thinking in 100 great discoveries and 100 great inventions. The second part will discuss the contribution of visual thinking to developing new theories in the social sciences based on advances in cognitive science. Cognitive-affective mapping is a new technique for visualizing the role of emotion in social cognition. EMPATHICA is a new graphical system for resolving conflicts by increasing empathy using cognitive-affective maps.","article_number":"6064934","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6064934","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064934/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064934/","publication_title":"IEEE
