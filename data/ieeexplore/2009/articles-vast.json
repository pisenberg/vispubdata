Our aim is to collect new ideas in order to be able to utilize VA techniques more effectively in our user interface development. Simulation-based IMO methods are developed for complex problem solving, where the expert decision maker (analyst) should be supported during the iterative process of eliciting preference information and examining the resulting output data. IMO is a subfield of multiple criteria decision making (MCDM). In simulation-based IMO, the optimization task is formulated in a mathematical model containing several conflicting objectives and constraints depending on decision variables. While using IMO methods the analyst progressively provides preference information in order to find the most satisfactory compromise between the conflicting objectives. In the poster, the implementations of two new IMO methods are used as examples to demonstrate concrete challenges of interaction design. One of them is described in this summary.","article_number":"5333081","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333081","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333081/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333081/","publication_title":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","conference_dates":"12-13 Oct. 2009","publication_number":5312461,"is_number":5332407,"publication_year":2009,"publication_date":"12-13 Oct. 2009","start_page":"237","end_page":"238","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":230,"insert_date":"20091113","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Information analysis","Collaboration","User interfaces","Analytical models","Problem-solving","Iterative methods","Decision making","Constraint optimization","Mathematical model"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Interactive multiobjective optimization","visual analytics","information visualization","interaction design"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5283-5","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2009.5333946","title":"VIScover: Visualizing, exploring, and analysing structured data","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-5283-5","partnum":"09EX4063","rank":4,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Derivo GmbH, Ulm University, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089043571","id":37089043571,"full_name":"Thorsten Liebig","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Derivo GmbH, Ulm University, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Derivo GmbH, Ulm University, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681697800","id":37681697800,"full_name":"Olaf Noppens","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Derivo GmbH, Ulm University, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Ulm University, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37443230700","id":37443230700,"full_name":"Friedrich von Henke","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Ulm University, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Today's challenging task in intelligent data processing is not to store large volumes of interlinked data but to visualize, explore, and understand its explicit or implicit relationships.

First, lack of a standardized evaluation criterion leads to costly re-designs for each task and specific user community. Second, this inadequacy in criterion validation raises significant uncertainty regarding visualization outputs and their related decisions, which may be especially troubling in high consequence environments like those of the intelligence community. As an attempt to standardize the ldquoapples and orangesrdquo of the extant situation, we propose the creation of standardized evaluation tools using general principles of human cognition. Theoretically, visual analytics enables the user to see information in a way that should attenuate the user's memory load and increase the user's task-available cognitive resources. By using general cognitive abilities like available working memory resources as our dependent measures, we propose to develop standardized evaluative capabilities that can be generalized across contexts, tasks, and user communities.","article_number":"5333468","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333468","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333468/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333468/","publication_title":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","conference_dates":"12-13 Oct. 2009","publication_number":5312461,"is_number":5332407,"publication_year":2009,"publication_date":"12-13 Oct. 2009","start_page":"217","end_page":"218","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":210,"insert_date":"20091113","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Data visualization","Uncertainty","Data analysis","Testing","Laboratories","Feedback","Process design","Humans","Cognition"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","evaluation","cognitive load"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5283-5","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2009.5333420","title":"Poster: Visual prediction of time series","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-5283-5","partnum":"09EX4063","rank":7,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hewlett Packard Laboratories, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274264300","id":37274264300,"full_name":"Ming C.

To show the effectiveness of two interface tools, one a floating text-based menu (Floating Menu) and the other a more interactive iconic tool (Interactive-Icon), we evaluated the use and human performance of both tools within one highly interactive visual analytics system. We asked participants to answer similarly constructed, straightforward questions in a genomic visualization, first with one tool, and then the other. During task performance we tracked completion times, task errors, and captured coarse-grained interactive behaviors. Based on the participants accuracy, speed, behaviors and post-task qualitative feedback, we observed that although the Interactive-Icon tool supports continuous interactions, task-oriented user evaluation did not find a significant difference between the two tools because there is a familiarity effect on the performance of solving the task questions with using Floating-Menu interface tool.","article_number":"5333469","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333469","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333469/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333469/","publication_title":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","conference_dates":"12-13 Oct. 2009","publication_number":5312461,"is_number":5332407,"publication_year":2009,"publication_date":"12-13 Oct. 2009","start_page":"219","end_page":"220","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":219,"insert_date":"20091113","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Organisms","Bioinformatics","Performance analysis","Humans","Genomics","Phylogeny","Data visualization","Cognition","Art"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5283-5","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2009.5334454","title":"VAST 2009 challenge: An insider threat","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-5283-5","partnum":"09EX4063","rank":14,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Massachusetts, Lowell, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37360588500","id":37360588500,"full_name":"Georges Grinstein","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Massachusetts, Lowell, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268671300","id":37268671300,"full_name":"Jean Scholtz","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37357067600","id":37357067600,"full_name":"Mark Whiting","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283026800","id":37283026800,"full_name":"Catherine Plaisant","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"The 4th VAST Challenge centered on a cyber analytics scenario and offered three mini-challenges with datasets of badge and network traffic data, a social network including geospatial information, and security video.

The users targeted by the visual analytics community (law enforcement personnel, professional information analysts, financial analysts, health care analysts, etc.) are often inaccessible to researchers. These analysts are extremely busy and their work environments and data are often classified or at least confidential. Furthermore, their tasks often last weeks or even months. It is simply not feasible to do such long-term observations to understand their jobs. How then can we hope to gather enough information about the diverse user populations to understand their needs? Some researchers, including the author, have been successful in getting access to specific end-users. A reasonable approach, therefore, would be to find a way to share user information. This work outlines a proposal for developing a handbook of user profiles for use by researchers, developers, and

The horizontal axis represents the time of day from early morning to late evening. A single employee's entire month is viewed all at once using this visualization. The employee being viewed can be changed using the arrow keys. Every IP event is represented by a vertical bar positioned at the exact time of its appearance. We color the IP events by port number, which is either intranet, HTTP, tomcat, or email, and size the bar based on the outgoing data size. Whenever an employee enters the classified area, a semi-transparent yellow region is drawn until that user exits the classified area. In rare cases when the user double enters, the region is twice as opaque, and in the other rare case where a user leaves the exits without entering, a red region is drawn until the next time the employee enters.

What kind of picture do we get by looking at a country's collection of law cases? We introduce parallel tag clouds: a new way to visualize differences amongst facets of very large metadata-rich text corpora. We have pointed parallel tag clouds at a collection of over 600,000 US Circuit Court decisions spanning a period of 50 years and have discovered regional as well as linguistic differences between courts. The visualization technique combines graphical elements from parallel coordinates and traditional tag clouds to provide rich overviews of a document collection while acting as an entry point for exploration of individual texts. We augment basic parallel tag clouds with a details-in-context display and an option to visualize changes over a second facet of the data, such as time. We also address text mining challenges such as selecting the best words to visualize, and how to do so in reasonable time periods to maintain interactivity.","article_number":"5333443","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333443","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333443/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333443/","publication_title":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","conference_dates":"12-13 Oct. 2009","publication_number":5312461,"is_number":5332407,"publication_year":2009,"publication_date":"12-13 Oct. 2009","start_page":"91","end_page":"98","citing_paper_count":145,"citing_patent_count":4,"download_count":2180,"insert_date":"20091113","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Tag clouds"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Text visualization","corpus visualization","information retrieval","text mining","tag clouds"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5283-5","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2009.5332584","title":"Interactive visual clustering of large collections of trajectories","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-5283-5","partnum":"09EX4063","rank":33,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer Institute of Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS), Sankt Augustin, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047100","id":37283047100,"full_name":"Gennady Andrienko","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute of Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS), Sankt Augustin, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer Institute of Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS), Sankt Augustin, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047700","id":37283047700,"full_name":"Natalia Andrienko","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute of Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS), Sankt Augustin, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"KDD Lab-ISTI-CNR, Pisa, Italy","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37670571400","id":37670571400,"full_name":"Salvatore Rinzivillo","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["KDD Lab-ISTI-CNR, Pisa, Italy"]}},{"affiliation":"KDD Lab-ISTI-CNR, Pisa, Italy","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37669195900","id":37669195900,"full_name":"Mirco Nanni","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["KDD Lab-ISTI-CNR, Pisa, Italy"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37394413600","id":37394413600,"full_name":"Dino Pedreschi","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"]}},{"affiliation":"KDD Lab-ISTI-CNR, Pisa, Italy","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268539100","id":37268539100,"full_name":"Fosca Giannotti","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["KDD Lab-ISTI-CNR, Pisa, Italy"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"One of the most common operations in exploration and analysis of various kinds of data is clustering, i.e. discovery and interpretation of groups of objects having similar properties and/or behaviors. In clustering, objects are often treated as points in multi-dimensional space of properties. However, structurally complex objects, such as trajectories of moving entities and other kinds of spatio-temporal data, cannot be adequately represented in this manner. Such data require sophisticated and computationally intensive clustering algorithms, which are very hard to scale effectively to large datasets not fitting in the computer main memory.

Numerous statistical tools and data transformations, such as projections, binning and clustering, have been coupled with visualization to help analysts understand data better and faster. However, data is inherently uncertain, due to error, noise or unreliable sources. When making decisions based on uncertain data, it is important to quantify and present to the analyst both the aggregated uncertainty of the results and the impact of the sources of that uncertainty. In this paper, we present a new framework to support uncertainty in the visual analytics process, through statistic methods such as uncertainty modeling, propagation and aggregation. We show that data transformations, such as regression, principal component analysis and k-means clustering, can be adapted to account for uncertainty. This framework leads to better visualizations that improve the decision-making process and help analysts gain insight on the analytic process itself.","article_number":"5332611","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5332611","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5332611/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5332611/","publication_title":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","conference_dates":"12-13 Oct. 2009","publication_number":5312461,"is_number":5332407,"publication_year":2009,"publication_date":"12-13 Oct. 2009","start_page":"51","end_page":"58","citing_paper_count":66,"citing_patent_count":5,"download_count":1192,"insert_date":"20091113","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Uncertainty","Data analysis","Data visualization","Principal component analysis","Statistical analysis","Sampling methods","Decision making","Humans","Blogs"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty","Data Transformations","Principal Component Analysis","Model Fitting"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5283-5","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2009.5332595","title":"Finding comparable temporal categorical records: A similarity measure with an interactive visualization","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-5283-5","partnum":"09EX4063","rank":36,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science & Human-Computer Interaction Lab, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37670523200","id":37670523200,"full_name":"Krist Wongsuphasawat","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Human-Computer Interaction Lab, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland at College Park, College Park, MD, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283016400","id":37283016400,"full_name":"Ben Shneiderman","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland at College Park, College Park, MD, US"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"An increasing number of temporal categorical databases are being collected: Electronic Health Records in healthcare organizations, traffic incident logs in transportation systems, or student records in universities. Finding similar records within these large databases requires effective similarity measures that capture the searcher's intent. Many similarity measures exist for numerical time series, but temporal categorical records are different. We propose a temporal categorical similarity measure, the M&M (Match & Mismatch) measure, which is based on the concept of aligning records by sentinel events, then matching events between the target and the compared records. The M&M measure combines the time differences between pairs of events and the number of mismatches. To accom-modate customization of parameters in the M&M measure and results interpretation, we implemented Similan, an interactive search and visualization tool for temporal categorical records. A usability study with 8 participants demonstrated that Similan was easy to learn and enabled them to find similar records, but users had difficulty understanding the M&M measure. The usability study feedback, led to an improved version with a continuous timeline, which was tested in a pilot study with 5 participants.","article_number":"5332595","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5332595","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5332595/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5332595/","publication_title":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","conference_dates":"12-13 Oct. 2009","publication_number":5312461,"is_number":5332407,"publication_year":2009,"publication_date":"12-13 Oct. 2009","start_page":"27","end_page":"34","citing_paper_count":61,"citing_patent_count":4,"download_count":920,"insert_date":"20091113","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Visual databases","Time measurement","Usability","Medical services","Transportation","Educational institutions","Particle measurements","Feedback","Testing"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Similan","M&M Measure","Similarity Search","Temporal Categorical Records"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5283-5","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2009.5332593","title":"Proximity-based visualization of movement trace data","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-5283-5","partnum":"09EX4063","rank":37,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37597152500","id":37597152500,"full_name":"Tarik Crnovrsanin","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37299311900","id":37299311900,"full_name":"Chris Muelder","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282925900","id":37282925900,"full_name":"Carlos Correa","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275869400","id":37275869400,"full_name":"Kwan-Liu Ma","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"The increasing availability of motion sensors and video cameras in living spaces has made possible the analysis of motion patterns and collective behavior in a number of situations. The visualization of this movement data, however, remains a challenge. Although maintaining the actual layout of the data space is often desirable, direct visualization of movement traces becomes cluttered and confusing as the spatial distribution of traces may be disparate and uneven. We present proximity-based visualization as a novel approach to the visualization of movement traces in an abstract space rather than the given spatial layout. This abstract space is obtained by considering proximity data, which is computed as the distance between entities and some number of important locations. These important locations can range from a single fixed point, to a moving point, several points, or even the proximities between the entities themselves. This creates a continuum of proximity spaces, ranging from the fixed absolute reference frame to completely relative reference frames. By combining these abstracted views with the concrete spatial views, we provide a way to mentally map the abstract spaces back to the real space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, and its applicability to visual analytics problems such as hazard prevention, migration patterns, and behavioral studies.","article_number":"5332593","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5332593","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5332593/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5332593/","publication_title":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","conference_dates":"12-13 Oct. 2009","publication_number":5312461,"is_number":5332407,"publication_year":2009,"publication_date":"12-13 Oct. 2009","start_page":"11","end_page":"18","citing_paper_count":52,"citing_patent_count":2,"download_count":907,"insert_date":"20091113","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Motion analysis","Principal component analysis","Availability","Cameras","Pattern analysis","Concrete","Visual analytics","Hazards","Multidimensional systems"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Spatio-temporal visualization","proximity","linked views","principal component analysis","temporal trajectories","movement patterns"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5283-5","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2009.5333919","title":"Visual opinion analysis of customer feedback data","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-5283-5","partnum":"09EX4063","rank":38,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591207400","id":37591207400,"full_name":"Daniela Oelke","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Hewlett Packard Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274264300","id":37274264300,"full_name":"Ming Hao","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hewlett Packard Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601356700","id":37601356700,"full_name":"Christian Rohrdantz","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","id":37283138700,"full_name":"Daniel A.

First, we introduce a new discrimination-based technique to automatically extract the terms that are the subject of the positive or negative opinion (such as price or customer service) and that are frequently commented on. Second, we derive a Reverse-Distance-Weighting method to map the attributes to the related positive and negative opinions in the text. Third, the resulting high-dimensional feature vectors are visualized in a new summary representation that provides a quick overview. We also cluster the reviews according to the similarity of the comments. Special thumbnails are used to provide insight into the composition of the clusters and their relationship. In addition, an interactive circular correlation map is provided to allow analysts to detect the relationships of the comments to other important attributes and the scores.

Determining how such systems foster insight and sensemaking is important for their continued growth and study, however. Furthermore, studies that identify how people use such systems and why they benefit (or not) can help inform the design of new systems in this area. We conducted an evaluation of the visual analytics system Jigsaw employed in a small investigative sensemaking exercise, and we compared its use to three other more traditional methods of analysis. Sixteen participants performed a simulated intelligence analysis task under one of the four conditions. Experimental results suggest that Jigsaw assisted participants to analyze the data and identify an embedded threat. We describe different analysis strategies used by study participants and how computational support (or the lack thereof) influenced the strategies. We then illustrate several characteristics of the sensemaking process identified in the study and provide design implications for investigative analysis tools based thereon.

In this process, analysts typically iterate through sequences of steps many times, varying parameters each time. Few visual analytics tools support this process well, nor do they provide support for visualizing and understanding the analysis process itself. To help analysts understand, explore, reference, and reuse their analysis process, we present a visual analytics system named CzSaw (See-Saw) that provides an editable and re-playable history navigation channel in addition to multiple visual representations of document collections and the entities within them (in a manner inspired by Jigsaw). Conventional history navigation tools range from basic undo and redo to branching timelines of user actions. In CzSaw's approach to this, first, user interactions are translated into a script language that drives the underlying scripting-driven propagation system. The latter allows analysts to edit analysis steps, and ultimately to program them. Second, on this base, we build both a history view showing progress and alternative paths, and a dependency graph showing the underlying logic of the analysis and dependency relations among the results of each step. These tools result in a visual model of the sense-making process, providing a way for analysts to visualize their analysis process, to reinterpret the problem, explore alternative paths, extract analysis patterns from existing history, and reuse them with other related analyses.","article_number":"5333020","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333020","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333020/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333020/","publication_title":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","conference_dates":"12-13 Oct. 2009","publication_number":5312461,"is_number":5332407,"publication_year":2009,"publication_date":"12-13 Oct. 2009","start_page":"131","end_page":"138","citing_paper_count":44,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":653,"insert_date":"20091113","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["History","Visual analytics","Pattern analysis","Information analysis","Failure analysis","Data visualization","Navigation","Logic","Graphical user interfaces","Art"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual Analytics","Sense-making","Analysis Process","Visual History"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5283-5","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2009.5333920","title":"FinVis: Applied visual analytics for personal financial planning","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-5283-5","partnum":"09EX4063","rank":41,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Regional Visualization and Analytics Center, Purdue University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396006000","id":37396006000,"full_name":"Stephen Rudolph","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Regional Visualization and Analytics Center, Purdue University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Economics, Purdue University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681662800","id":37681662800,"full_name":"Anya Savikhin","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Economics, Purdue University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Regional Visualization and Analytics Center, Purdue University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282598900","id":37282598900,"full_name":"David S.

FinVis helps the user overcome cognitive limitations and understand the impact of correlation between financial instruments in order to reap the benefits of portfolio diversification. Because this software is accessible by non-expert users, decision-makers from the general population can benefit greatly from using FinVis in practical applications. We quantify the value of FinVis using experimental economics methods and find that subjects using the FinVis software make better financial portfolio decisions as compared to subjects using a tabular version with the same information. We also find that FinVis engages the user, which results in greater exploration of the dataset and increased learning as compared to a tabular display.

The resulting optimal reduced dimension depends on the optimization criteria and is often larger than 2. In the second stage, the dimension is further reduced to 2 for visualization purposes by another dimension reduction method such as principal component analysis. The role of the second-stage is to minimize the loss of information due to reducing the dimension all the way to 2.

Specifically, we use the self-organizing-map algorithm in conjunction with a user-adaptable combination of graph features for clustering of graphs. It offers insight into the overall structure of the data set. The clustering output is presented in a grid containing clusters of the connected components of the input graph. Interactive feature selection and task-tailored data views allow the exploration of the whole graph space. The system provides also tools for assessment and display of cluster quality. We demonstrate the usefulness of our system by application to a shareholder network analysis problem based on a large real-world data set.

Using this system, analysts are able to explore and navigate in model parameter space, interactively select and tune patterns, and refine the model for accuracy using computational techniques.

Therefore, the analysis of patent information has become an inevitable task for a variety of interest groups. The retrieval of relevant patent information is an integral part of almost every patent analysis scenario. Unfortunately, the complexity of patent material inhibits a straightforward retrieval of all relevant patent documents and leads to iterative, time-consuming approaches in practice. With `PatViz', a new system for interactive analysis of patent information has been developed to leverage iterative query refinement. PatViz supports users in building complex queries visually and in exploring patent result sets interactively. Thereby, the visual query module introduces an abstraction layer that provides uniform access to different retrieval systems and relieves users of the burden to learn different complex query languages. By establishing an integrated environment it allows for interactive reintegration of insights gained from visual result set exploration into the visual query representation. We expect that the approach we have taken is also suitable to improve iterative query refinement in other Visual Analytics systems.","article_number":"5333564","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333564","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333564/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333564/","publication_title":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","conference_dates":"12-13 Oct. 2009","publication_number":5312461,"is_number":5332407,"publication_year":2009,"publication_date":"12-13 Oct. 2009","start_page":"203","end_page":"210","citing_paper_count":20,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":552,"insert_date":"20091113","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Information analysis","Information retrieval","Visualization","Visual analytics","Companies","Environmental economics","Iterative methods","Intellectual property","Interactive systems","Database languages"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Patent retrieval","information visualization","visual analytics","multiple coordinated views"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5283-5","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2009.5333437","title":"Describing story evolution from dynamic information streams","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-5283-5","partnum":"09EX4063","rank":48,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37434158300","id":37434158300,"full_name":"Stuart Rose","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38179762500","id":38179762500,"full_name":"Scott Butner","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37672002300","id":37672002300,"full_name":"Wendy Cowley","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37285562300","id":37285562300,"full_name":"Michelle Gregory","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37671797700","id":37671797700,"full_name":"Julia Walker","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Sources of streaming information, such as news syndicates, publish information continuously. Information portals and news aggregators list the latest information from around the world enabling information consumers to easily identify events in the past 24 hours. The volume and velocity of these streams causes information from prior days to quickly vanish despite its utility in providing an informative context for interpreting new information. Few capabilities exist to support an individual attempting to identify or understand trends and changes from streaming information over time. The burden of retaining prior information and integrating with the new is left to the skills, determination, and discipline of each individual. In this paper we present a visual analytics system for linking essential content from information streams over time into dynamic stories that develop and change over multiple days. We describe particular challenges to the analysis of streaming information and present a fundamental visual representation for showing story change and evolution over time.","article_number":"5333437","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333437","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333437/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333437/","publication_title":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","conference_dates":"12-13 Oct. 2009","publication_number":5312461,"is_number":5332407,"publication_year":2009,"publication_date":"12-13 Oct. 2009","start_page":"99","end_page":"106","citing_paper_count":17,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":616,"insert_date":"20091113","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Information analysis","Graphics","Visual analytics","Joining processes","Streaming media","Data models","Laboratories","Portals","Image analysis","Indexing"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["H.3.1 [Content Analysis and Indexing]: Abstracting methods—","H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: Information Filtering—","H.3.7 [Digital Libraries]: User Issues—","I.3.3 [Computer Graphics]: Picture/Image Generation—"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5283-5","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2009.5333023","title":"Connecting the dots in visual analysis","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-5283-5","partnum":"09EX4063","rank":49,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681468200","id":37681468200,"full_name":"Yedendra B.

This process is often called “connecting the dots.” When analysts interactively explore complex datasets over multiple sessions, they may uncover a large number of findings. As a result, it is often difficult for them to recall the past insights, views and concepts that are most relevant to their current line of inquiry. This challenge is even more difficult during collaborative analysis tasks where they need to find connections between their own discoveries and insights found by others. In this paper, we describe a context-based retrieval algorithm to identify notes, views and concepts from users' past analyses that are most relevant to a view or a note based on their line of inquiry. We then describe a related notes recommendation feature that surfaces the most relevant items to the user as they work based on this algorithm. We have implemented this recommendation feature in HARVEST, a web based visual analytic system. We evaluate the related notes recommendation feature of HARVEST through a case study and discuss the implications of our approach.","article_number":"5333023","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333023","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333023/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333023/","publication_title":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","conference_dates":"12-13 Oct. 2009","publication_number":5312461,"is_number":5332407,"publication_year":2009,"publication_date":"12-13 Oct. 2009","start_page":"123","end_page":"130","citing_paper_count":16,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":366,"insert_date":"20091113","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Joining processes","Algorithm design and analysis","Information retrieval","Visual analytics","Information analysis","Data visualization","Collaboration","Context modeling","Heuristic algorithms","Tag clouds"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]—Retrieval models"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5283-5","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2009.5333428","title":"LSAView: A tool for visual exploration of latent semantic modeling","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-5283-5","partnum":"09EX4063","rank":50,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Sandia National Laboratories, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282576500","id":37282576500,"full_name":"Patricia J.

One of the biggest challenges in using LSA is determining the appropriate model parameters to use for different data domains and types of analyses. Although automated methods have been developed to make rank and scaling parameter choices, these approaches often make choices with respect to noise in the data, without an understanding of how those choices impact analysis and problem solving. Further, no tools currently exist to explore the relationships between an LSA model and analysis methods. Our work focuses on how parameter choices impact analysis and problem solving.

The data generated by the laboratory workflow naturally lends itself to a scatter plot visualization. However, characteristics of this data give rise to some unique aspects not typical of a standard scatter plot. We are able to take the output from tandem mass spectrometry and render the data in such a way that it mimics more traditional two-dimensional gel techniques and at the same time reveals the correlated behavior indicative of protein complexes. By computationally measuring these correlated patterns in the data, membership in putative complexes can be inferred. User interactions are provided to support both an interactive discovery mode as well as an unsupervised clustering of likely complexes.

By finding unique fingerprints of RF signals received at different locations within a predefined area beforehand, whenever a similar fingerprint is subsequently seen again, the localization system will be able to infer a user's current location. However, developers of these systems face the problem of finding reliable RF fingerprints that are unique enough and adequately stable over time. We present a visual analytics system that enables developers of these localization systems to visually gain insight on whether their collected datasets and chosen fingerprint features have the necessary properties to enable a reliable RF fingerprinting-based localization system. The system was evaluated by testing and debugging an existing localization system.","article_number":"5332596","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5332596","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5332596/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5332596/","publication_title":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","conference_dates":"12-13 Oct. 2009","publication_number":5312461,"is_number":5332407,"publication_year":2009,"publication_date":"12-13 Oct. 2009","start_page":"35","end_page":"42","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":391,"insert_date":"20091113","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Radio frequency","Fingerprint recognition","Global Positioning System","RF signals","Satellite broadcasting","Electronic mail","Debugging","Signal generators","Receivers"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["H.5.2 [User Interfaces]: Graphical user interfaces (GUI)—","D.2.5 [Testing and Debugging]: Debugging aids—"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5283-5","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2009.5333917","title":"Using projection and 2D plots to visually reveal genetic mechanisms of complex human disorders","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-5283-5","partnum":"09EX4063","rank":56,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Battelle Center of Mathematical Medicine, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Ohio State Uinversity, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37570501300","id":37570501300,"full_name":"Boonthanome Nouanesengsy","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Battelle Center of Mathematical Medicine, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Ohio State Uinversity, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Battelle Center of Mathematical Medicine, Nationwide Children's Hospital, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37667195400","id":37667195400,"full_name":"Sang-Cheol Seok","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Battelle Center of Mathematical Medicine, Nationwide Children's Hospital, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Ohio State Uinversity, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279493500","id":37279493500,"full_name":"Han-Wei Shen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Ohio State Uinversity, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Battelle Center of Mathematical Medicine, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Ohio State Uinversity, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681642300","id":37681642300,"full_name":"Veronica J Vieland","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Battelle Center of Mathematical Medicine, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Ohio State Uinversity, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Gene mapping is a statistical method used to localize human disease genes to particular regions of the human genome. When performing such analysis, a genetic likelihood space is generated and sampled, which results in a multidimensional scalar field. Researchers are interested in exploring this likelihood space through the use of visualization. Previous efforts at visualizing this space, though, were slow and cumbersome, only showing a small portion of the space at a time, thus requiring the user to keep a mental picture of several views. We have developed a new technique that displays much more data at once by projecting the multidimensional data into several 2D plots. One plot is created for each parameter that shows the change along that parameter. A radial projection is used to create another plot that provides an overview of the high dimensional surface from the perspective of a single point. Linking and brushing between all the plots are used to determine relationships between parameters. We demonstrate our techniques on real world autism data, showing how to visually examine features of the high dimensional space.","article_number":"5333917","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333917","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333917/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333917/","publication_title":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","conference_dates":"12-13 Oct. 2009","publication_number":5312461,"is_number":5332407,"publication_year":2009,"publication_date":"12-13 Oct. 2009","start_page":"171","end_page":"178","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":149,"insert_date":"20091113","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Genetics","Humans","Multidimensional systems","Space exploration","Data visualization","Statistical analysis","Diseases","Genomics","Bioinformatics","Performance analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Multidimensional data","Linkage Analysis","Posterior Probability of Linkage","PPL","PPLD","LD analysis","Linkage disequilibrium","Autism"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5283-5","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2009.5332610","title":"Geovisual analytics for self-organizing network data","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-5283-5","partnum":"09EX4063","rank":57,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"National Center for Visual Analytics, Dept. of Science and Technology, Linköping University, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087652378","id":37087652378,"full_name":"Van Quan Ho","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["National Center for Visual Analytics, Dept. of Science and Technology, Linköping University, Sweden"]}},{"affiliation":"Dept. of Science and Technology, Linköping University, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37669906900","id":37669906900,"full_name":"Tobias Astrom","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Dept. of Science and Technology, Linköping University, Sweden"]}},{"affiliation":"Dept. of Science and Technology, Linköping University, Sweden","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283245900","id":37283245900,"full_name":"Mikael Jern","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Dept. of Science and Technology, Linköping University, Sweden"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Cellular radio networks are continually growing in both node count and complexity. It therefore becomes more difficult to manage the networks and necessary to use time and cost effective automatic algorithms to organize the networks neighbor cell relations. There have been a number of attempts to develop such automatic algorithms. Network operators, however, may not trust them because they need to have an understanding of their behavior and of their reliability and performance, which is not easily perceived. This paper presents a novel Web-enabled geovisual analytics approach to exploration and understanding of self-organizing network data related to cells and neighbor cell relations. A demonstrator and case study are presented in this paper, developed in close collaboration with the Swedish telecom company Ericsson and based on large multivariate, time-varying and geospatial data provided by the company. It allows the operators to follow, interact with and analyze the evolution of a self-organizing network and enhance their understanding of how an automatic algorithm configures locally-unique physical cell identities and organizes neighbor cell relations of the network. The geovisual analytics tool is tested with a self-organizing network that is operated by the automatic neighbor relations (ANR) algorithm. The demonstrator has been tested with positive results by a group of domain experts from Ericsson and will be tested in production.","article_number":"5332610","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5332610","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5332610/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5332610/","publication_title":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","conference_dates":"12-13 Oct. 2009","publication_number":5312461,"is_number":5332407,"publication_year":2009,"publication_date":"12-13 Oct. 2009","start_page":"43","end_page":"50","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":325,"insert_date":"20091113","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Self-organizing networks","Information analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Data analysis","Data visualization","Testing","Visual analytics","Pattern analysis","Filtering","Large-scale systems"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Geovisual analytics","visualization","self-organizing network","multi-layer","multi-dimensional","time-varying","geospatial data sets"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5283-5","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2009.5334150","title":"Symposium committee","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-5283-5","partnum":"09EX4063","rank":58,"authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"Provides a listing of current committee members.","article_number":"5334150","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5334150","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5334150/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5334150/","publication_title":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","conference_dates":"12-13 Oct. 2009","publication_number":5312461,"is_number":5332407,"publication_year":2009,"publication_date":"12-13 Oct. 2009","start_page":"x","end_page":"x","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":105,"insert_date":"20091113","index_terms":{},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5283-5","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2009.5334118","title":"Using stories to understand patterns","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"978-1-4244-5283-5","partnum":"09EX4063","rank":59,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"SUPA, Department of Physics, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271142500","id":37271142500,"full_name":"Andrew Glassner","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SUPA, Department of Physics, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK"]}}]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Conferences","abstract":"People easily find patterns everywhere, from familiar faces in pancakes to voices on the wind and tigers in the clouds.

Visualization could help analysts to explore large collections of data and documents, supporting the analysts investigative sense-making processes. This panel gathers recognized leaders from three important domains, investigative reporting, biosciences (genomics), and intelligence analysis, that all include a fundamental investigative analysis component. The panelists will provide a glimpse into their worlds, describing and illustrating the data they examine, the goals and methods of their analysts, and the culture of their respective professions. In particular, the panelists will explore how visualization could potentially benefit investigators from their domain and they will provide guidance for visualization researchers seeking to collaborate with their colleagues.","article_number":"5332411","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5332411","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5332411/","publication_title":"2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","conference_location":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","conference_dates":"12-13 Oct. 2009","publication_number":5312461,"is_number":5332407,"publication_year":2009,"publication_date":"12-13 Oct. 2009","start_page":"279","end_page":"281","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":322,"insert_date":"20091113","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visual analytics","Genomics","Bioinformatics","Information analysis","Software systems","Military computing","Text analysis","Collaboration","Information systems"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["investigative analysis","interactive visualization","visual analytics","investigative reporting","genomics","intelligence analysis"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5283-5","isbnType":"New-2005"}]}}]}
