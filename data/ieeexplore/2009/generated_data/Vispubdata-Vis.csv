Vis,2009,Color Seamlessness in Multi-Projector Displays Using Constrained Gamut Morphing,10.1109/TVCG.2009.124,https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.124,1317,1326,Journals,"Multi-projector displays show significant spatial variation in 3D color gamut due to variation in the chromaticity gamuts across the projectors, vignetting effect of each projector and also overlap across adjacent projectors. In this paper we present a new constrained gamut morphing algorithm that removes all these variations and results in true color seamlessness across tiled multiprojector displays. Our color morphing algorithm adjusts the intensities of light from each pixel of each projector precisely to achieve a smooth morphing from one projector’s gamut to the other’s through the overlap region. This morphing is achieved by imposing precise constraints on the perceptual difference between the gamuts of two adjacent pixels. In addition, our gamut morphing assures a C1 continuity yielding visually pleasing appearance across the entire display.We demonstrate our method successfully on a planar and a curved display using both low and high-end projectors. Our approach is completely scalable, efficient and automatic. We also demonstrate the real-time performance of our image correction algorithm on GPUs for interactive applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that presents a scalable method with a strong foundation in perception and realizes, for the first time, a truly seamless display where the number of projectors cannot be deciphered.",,Behzad Sajadi;Maxim Lazarov;M.

The output from a level above is input to the level below, bringing attention to the design challenge that an upstream error inevitably cascades to all downstream levels. This model provides prescriptive guidance for determining appropriate evaluation approaches by identifying threats to validity unique to each level. We also provide three recommendations motivated by this model: authors should distinguish between these levels when claiming contributions at more than one of them, authors should explicitly state upstream assumptions at levels above the focus of a paper, and visualization venues should accept more papers on domain characterization.",,Tamara Munzner,"University of British Columbia, Canada",,"Models,frameworks,design,evaluation.,,,,",,508,,

We introduce Bubble Sets as a visualization technique for data that has both a primary data relation with a semantically significant spatial organization and a significant set membership relation in which members of the same set are not necessarily adjacent in the primary layout. In order to maintain the spatial rights of the primary data relation, we avoid layout adjustment techniques that improve set cluster continuity and density. Instead, we use a continuous, possibly concave, isocontour to delineate set membership, without disrupting the primary layout. Optimizations minimize cluster overlap and provide for calculation of the isocontours at interactive speeds. Case studies show how this technique can be used to indicate multiple sets on a variety of common visualizations.",,Christopher Collins;Gerald Penn;Sheelagh Carpendale,"University of Toronto, Canada;University of Toronto, Canada;University of Calgary, Canada",,"clustering,spatial layout,graph visualization,tree visualization,,,,",,215,,

Powerful visualization systems may be inflexible or impose abstractions foreign to visual thinking, while graphical systems such as rendering APIs and vector-based drawing programs are tedious for complex work. We argue that an easy-to-use graphical system tailored for visualization is needed. In response, we contribute Protovis, an extensible toolkit for constructing visualizations by composing simple graphical primitives. In Protovis, designers specify visualizations as a hierarchy of marks with visual properties defined as functions of data. This representation achieves a level of expressiveness comparable to low-level graphics systems, while improving efficiency - the effort required to specify a visualization - and accessibility - the effort required to learn and modify the representation. We substantiate this claim through a diverse collection of examples and comparative analysis with popular visualization tools.",,Michael Bostock;Jeffrey Heer,"Computer Science Department, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA;Computer Science Department, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA",,"Information visualization,user interfaces,toolkits,2D graphics.,,,,",,199,,

Such geographically embedded networks (graphs) are usually very large. For example, the county-to-county migration data in the U.S. has thousands of counties and about a million migration paths. Moreover, many variables are associated with each flow, such as the number of migrants for different age groups, income levels, and occupations. It is a challenging task to visualize such data and discover network structures, multivariate relations, and their geographic patterns simultaneously. This paper addresses these challenges by developing an integrated interactive visualization framework that consists three coupled components: (1) a spatially constrained graph partitioning method that can construct a hierarchy of geographical regions (communities), where there are more flows or connections within regions than across regions; (2) a multivariate clustering and visualization method to detect and present multivariate patterns in the aggregated region-to-region flows; and (3) a highly interactive flow mapping component to map both flow and multivariate patterns in the geographic space, at different hierarchical levels. The proposed approach can process relatively large data sets and effectively discover and visualize major flow structures and multivariate relations at the same time. User interactions are supported to facilitate the understanding of both an overview and detailed patterns.",,Diansheng Guo,"Department of Geography, University of South Carolina, USA",,"hierarchical clustering,graph partitioning,flow mapping,spatial interaction,contiguity constraints,multidimensional visualization,coordinated views,data mining",,164,,

However, there are many situations where such an overview is not relevant or practical for users, as analyzing the global structure may not be related to the main task of the users that have semi-specific information needs. Furthermore, users accessing large graph databases through an online connection or users running on less powerful (mobile) hardware simply do not have the resources needed to compute these overviews. In this paper, we advocate an interaction model that allows users to remotely browse the immediate context graph around a specific node of interest. We show how Furnas’ original degree of interest function can be adapted from trees to graphs and how we can use this metric to extract useful contextual subgraphs, control the complexity of the generated visualization and direct users to interesting datapoints in the context.

Conserve dsyntenic blocks are an important biological data abstraction for indicating regions of shared sequences. The goal of this work is to show multiple types of relationships at multiple scales in a way that is visually comprehensible in accordance with known perceptual principles. We present a task analysis for this domain where the fundamental questions asked by biologists can be understood by a characterization of relationships into the four types of proximity/location, size, orientation, and similarity/strength, and the four scales of genome, chromosome, block, and genomic feature. We also propose a new taxonomy of the design space for visually encoding conservation data. We present MizBee, a multiscale synteny browser with the unique property of providing interactive side-by-side views of the data across the range of scales supporting exploration of all of these relationship types.

Most multivariate visualization techniques are unable to display such data effectively, and a common approach is to employ dimensionality reduction prior to visualization. Most existing dimensionality reduction systems focus on preserving one or a few significant structures in data. For many analysis tasks, however, several types of structures can be of high significance and the importance of a certain structure compared to the importance of another is often task-dependent. This paper introduces a system for dimensionality reduction by combining user-defined quality metrics using weight functions to preserve as many important structures as possible. The system aims at effective visualization and exploration of structures within large multivariate data sets and provides enhancement of diverse structures by supplying a range of automatic variable orderings. Furthermore it enables a quality-guided reduction of variables through an interactive display facilitating investigation of trade-offs between loss of structure and the number of variables to keep.

Different from most multiple views visualization frameworks involving parallel coordinates where each visualization type occupies an individual window, we convert two selected neighboring coordinate axes into a scatterplot directly. Multidimensional scaling is adopted to allow converting multiple axes into a single subplot. The transition between two visual types is designed in a seamless way. In our work, a series of interaction tools has been developed. Uniform brushing functionality is implemented to allow the user to perform data selection on both points and parallel coordinate polylines without explicitly switching tools.

An analysis tool must emphasize both the prevalence and the temporal ordering of these events. Additionally, the analysis tool must also support flexible comparisons to allow analysts to gather visual evidence. In a previsous work, we introduced align, rank, and filter (ARF) to accentuate temporal ordering. In this paper, we present temporal summaries, an interactive visualization technique that highlights the prevalence of event occurrences. Temporal summaries dynamically aggregate events in multiple granularities (year, month, week, day, hour, etc.) for the purpose of spotting trends over time and comparing several groups of records. They provide affordances for analysts to perform temporal range filters.

The visual analysis is therefore difficult, especially if a specific class of trajectories in an erroneous dataset has to be studied. We designed FromDaDy, a trajectory visualization tool that tackles the difficulties of exploring the visualization of multiple trails. This multidimensional data exploration is based on scatterplots, brushing, pick and drop, juxtaposed views and rapid visual design. Users can organize the workspace composed of multiple juxtaposed views. They can define the visual configuration of the views by connecting data dimensions from the dataset to Bertin's visual variables. They can then brush trajectories, and with a pick and drop operation they can spread the brushed information across views. They can then repeat these interactions, until they extract a set of relevant data, thus formulating complex queries. Through two real-world scenarios, we show how FromDaDy supports iterative queries and the extraction of trajectories in a dataset that contains up to 5 million data.",,Christophe Hurter;Benjamin Tissoires;Stéphane Conversy,"DSNA DTI Research and Development, ENAC and IRIT IHCS, France;DSNA DTI Research and Development, ENAC and IRIT IHCS, France;ENAC and IRIT IHCS, France",,"visualization,iterative exploration,direct manipulation,trajectories,,,,",,91,,
Vis,2009,A User Study to Compare Four Uncertainty Visualization Methods for 1D and 2D Datasets,10.1109/TVCG.2009.114,https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.114,1209,1218,Journals,"Many techniques have been proposed to show uncertainty in data visualizations. However, very little is known about their effectiveness in conveying meaningful information. In this paper, we present a user study that evaluates the perception of uncertainty amongst four of the most commonly used techniques for visualizing uncertainty in one-dimensional and two-dimensional data. The techniques evaluated are traditional errorbars, scaled size of glyphs, color-mapping on glyphs, and color-mapping of uncertainty on the data surface. The study uses generated data that was designed to represent the systematic and random uncertainty components. Twenty-seven users performed two types of search tasks and two types of counting tasks on 1D and 2D datasets. The search tasks involved finding data points that were least or most uncertain. The counting tasks involved counting data features or uncertainty features. A 4 times 4 full-factorial ANOVA indicated a significant interaction between the techniques used and the type of tasks assigned for both datasets indicating that differences in performance between the four techniques depended on the type of task performed. Several one-way ANOVAs were computed to explore the simple main effects. Bonferronni's correction was used to control for the family-wise error rate for alpha-inflation. Although we did not find a consistent order among the four techniques for all the tasks, there are several findings from the study that we think are useful for uncertainty visualization design. We found a significant difference in user performance between searching for locations of high and searching for locations of low uncertainty. Errorbars consistently underperformed throughout the experiment. Scaling the size of glyphs and color-mapping of the surface performed reasonably well. The efficiency of most of these techniques were highly dependent on the tasks performed. We believe that these findings can be used in future uncertainty visualization design. In addition, the framework developed in this user study presents a structured approach to evaluate uncertainty visualization techniques, as well as provides a basis for future research in uncertainty visualization.",,Jibonananda Sanyal;Song Zhang;Gargi Bhattacharya;Phil Amburn;Robert Moorhead,"Geosystems Research Institute, High Performance Computing Collaboratory, Mississippi State University, USA;Computer Science and Engineering Department, Mississippi State University, USA;Department of Psychology, Southem Illinois University, Carbondale, USA;Geosystems Research Institute, High Performance Computing Collaboratory, Mississippi State University, USA;Geosystems Research Institute, High Performance Computing Collaboratory, Mississippi State University, USA",,"User study,uncertainty visualization,,,,,,",,89,,
Vis,2009,An interactive visualization tool for multi-channel confocal microscopy data in neurobiology research,10.1109/TVCG.2009.118,https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.118,1489,1496,Journals,"Confocal microscopy is widely used in neurobiology for studying the three-dimensional structure of the nervous system. Confocal image data are often multi-channel, with each channel resulting from a different fluorescent dye or fluorescent protein; one channel may have dense data, while another has sparse; and there are often structures at several spatial scales: subneuronal domains, neurons, and large groups of neurons (brain regions). Even qualitative analysis can therefore require visualization using techniques and parameters fine-tuned to a particular dataset. Despite the plethora of volume rendering techniques that have been available for many years, the techniques standardly used in neurobiological research are somewhat rudimentary, such as looking at image slices or maximal intensity projections. Thus there is a real demand from neurobiologists, and biologists in general, for a flexible visualization tool that allows interactive visualization of multi-channel confocal data, with rapid fine-tuning of parameters to reveal the three-dimensional relationships of structures of interest. Together with neurobiologists, we have designed such a tool, choosing visualization methods to suit the characteristics of confocal data and a typical biologist's workflow. We use interactive volume rendering with intuitive settings for multidimensional transfer functions, multiple render modes and multi-views for multi-channel volume data, and embedding of polygon data into volume data for rendering and editing. As an example, we apply this tool to visualize confocal microscopy datasets of the developing zebrafish visual system.",,Yong Wan;Hideo Otsuna;Chi-Bin Chien;Charles Hansen,"Scientific and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA;Department of Neurobiology and Anatomy, University of Utah, USA;Department of Neurobiology and Anatomy, University of Utah, USA;Scientific and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA",,"Visualization,neurobiology,confocal microscopy,qualitative analysis,volume rendering,,,",,88,,

The visualization of such data in parallel coordinates may reveal patterns latently contained in the data and thus can improve the understanding of multidimensional relations. In this paper, we adopt the concept of continuous scatterplots for the visualization of spatially continuous input data to derive a density model for parallel coordinates. Based on the point-line duality between scatterplots and parallel coordinates, we propose a mathematical model that maps density from a continuous scatterplot to parallel coordinates and present different algorithms for both numerical and analytical computation of the resulting density field. In addition, we show how the 2-D model can be used to successively construct continuous parallel coordinates with an arbitrary number of dimensions.

These are achieved by integrating a representation of the information visualization pipeline into the shared workspace, thus explicitly indicating coordination points on data, representation, presentation, and view levels.

Vis,2009,Structuring Feature Space: A Non-Parametric Method for Volumetric Transfer Function Generation,10.1109/TVCG.2009.185,https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.185,1473,1480,Journals,"The use of multi-dimensional transfer functions for direct volume rendering has been shown to be an effective means of extracting materials and their boundaries for both scalar and multivariate data. The most common multi-dimensional transfer function consists of a two-dimensional (2D) histogram with axes representing a subset of the feature space (e.g., value vs. value gradient magnitude), with each entry in the 2D histogram being the number of voxels at a given feature space pair. Users then assign color and opacity to the voxel distributions within the given feature space through the use of interactive widgets (e.g., box, circular, triangular selection). Unfortunately, such tools lead users through a trial-and-error approach as they assess which data values within the feature space map to a given area of interest within the volumetric space. In this work, we propose the addition of non-parametric clustering within the transfer function feature space in order to extract patterns and guide transfer function generation. We apply a non-parametric kernel density estimation to group voxels of similar features within the 2D histogram. These groups are then binned and colored based on their estimated density, and the user may interactively grow and shrink the binned regions to explore feature boundaries and extract regions of interest. We also extend this scheme to temporal volumetric data in which time steps of 2D histograms are composited into a histogram volume. A three-dimensional (3D) density estimation is then applied, and users can explore regions within the feature space across time without adjusting the transfer function at each time step. Our work enables users to effectively explore the structures found within a feature space of the volume and provide a context in which the user can understand how these structures relate to their volumetric data. We provide tools for enhanced exploration and manipulation of the transfer function, and we show that the initial transfer function generation serves as a reasonable base for volumetric rendering, reducing the trial-and-error overhead typically found in transfer function design.",,Ross Maciejewski;Insoo Woo;Wei Chen;David Ebert,"Rendering and Perceptualization Laboratory, Purdue University, USA;Rendering and Perceptualization Laboratory, Purdue University, USA;State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG, University of Zhejiang, China;Rendering and Perceptualization Laboratory, Purdue University, USA",,"Volume rendering,kernel density estimation,transfer function design,temporal volume rendering,,,,",,73,,
Vis,2009,The Occlusion Spectrum for Volume Classification and Visualization,10.1109/TVCG.2009.189,https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.189,1465,1472,Journals,"Despite the ever-growing improvements on graphics processing units and computational power, classifying 3D volume data remains a challenge.In this paper, we present a new method for classifying volume data based on the ambient occlusion of voxels. This information stems from the observation that most volumes of a certain type, e.g., CT, MRI or flow simulation, contain occlusion patterns that reveal the spatial structure of their materials or features. Furthermore, these patterns appear to emerge consistently for different data sets of the same type. We call this collection of patterns the \emph{occlusion spectrum} of a dataset. We show that using this occlusion spectrum leads to better two-dimensional transfer functions that can help classify complex data sets in terms of the spatial relationships among features.

Different weighting schemes determine the ability to separate structures of interest in the occlusion spectrum. We present a general methodology for finding such a weighting.

Following the methods suggested by van Ham et al.

Users were asked to optimize their layout for aesthetics and analytical tasks with a social network. We discuss characteristics of the user-generated layouts and interaction methods employed by users in this process. We then report on a web-based study to compare these layouts with the output of popular automatic layout algorithms. Our results demonstrate that the best of the user-generated layouts performed as well as or better than the physics-based layout. Orthogonal and circular automatic layouts were found to be considerably less effective than either the physics-based layout or the best of the user-generated layouts.

Accordingly, the need for high quality visualization of these protein systems raises. Highly interactive visualization techniques are especially needed for the analysis of time-dependent molecular simulations. Beside various other molecular representations the surface representations are of high importance for these applications. So far, users had to accept a trade-off between rendering quality and performance - particularly when visualizing trajectories of time-dependent protein data. We present a new approach for visualizing the solvent excluded surface of proteins using a GPU ray casting technique and thus achieving interactive frame rates even for long protein trajectories where conventional methods based on precomputation are not applicable. Furthermore, we propose a semantic simplification of the raw protein data to reduce the visual complexity of the surface and thereby accelerate the rendering without impeding perception of the protein's basic shape. We also demonstrate the application of our solvent excluded surface method to visualize the spatial probability density for the protein atoms over the whole period of the trajectory in one frame, providing a qualitative analysis of the protein flexibility.",,Michael Krone;Katrin Bidmon;Thomas Ertl,"Visualization Research Center VISUS, Universität Stuttgart, Germany;Visualization Research Center VISUS, Universität Stuttgart, Germany;Visualization Research Center VISUS, Universität Stuttgart, Germany",,"Point-based Data,Time-varying Data,GPU,Ray Casting,Molecular Visualization,Surface Extraction,Isosurfaces,",,61,,

We introduce a procedure called ""loop surgery"" that transforms M into a mesh M' by a sequence of cuts and guarantees the Reeb graph of f(M') to be loop free. Therefore, loop surgery reduces Reeb graph computation to the simpler problem of computing a contour tree, for which well-known algorithms exist that are theoretically efficient (O(n log n)) and fast in practice. Inverse cuts reconstruct the loops removed at the beginning.The time complexity of our algorithm is that of a contour tree computation plus a loop surgery overhead, which depends on the number of handles of the mesh. Our systematic experiments confirm that for real-life data, this overhead is comparable to the computation of the contour tree, demonstrating virtually linear scalability on meshes ranging from 70 thousand to 3.5 million tetrahedra. Performance numbers show that our algorithm, although restricted to volumetric data, has an average speedup factor of 6,500 over the previous fastest techniques, handling larger and more complex data-sets.We demonstrate the verstility of our approach by extending fast topologically clean isosurface extraction to non simply-connected domains. We apply this technique in the context of pressure analysis for mechanical design. In this case, our technique produces results in matter of seconds even for the largest meshes.

Hierarchical displays of this type condition a dataset by multiple discrete variable values, creating nested graphical summaries of the resulting subsets in which size, shape and colour can be used to show subset properties. These 'small multiples' are ordered by the conditioning variable values and are laid out hierarchically using dimensional stacking. Crucially, we consider the use of different layouts at different hierarchical levels, so that the coordinates of the plane can be used more effectively to draw attention to trends and anomalies in the data. We argue that these layouts should be informed by the type of conditioning variable and by the research question being explored.

We propose that particle systems have a significantly more general role in sampling structure from unsegmented data. We describe a particle system that computes samplings of crease features (i.e. ridges and valleys, as lines or surfaces) that effectively represent many anatomical structures in scanned medical data. Because structure naturally exists at a range of sizes relative to the image resolution, computer vision has developed the theory of scale-space, which considers an n-D image as an (n + 1)-D stack of images at different blurring levels. Our scale-space particles move through continuous four-dimensional scale-space according to spatial constraints imposed by the crease features, a particle-image energy that draws particles towards scales of maximal feature strength, and an inter-particle energy that controls sampling density in space and scale. To make scale-space practical for large three-dimensional data, we present a spline-based interpolation across scale from a small number of pre-computed blurrings at optimally selected scales. The configuration of the particle system is visualized with tensor glyphs that display information about the local Hessian of the image, and the scale of the particle.

Automation of transfer function specifications still remains a challenge in volume rendering. This paper presents an approach for automating transfer function generations by utilizing topological attributes derived from the contour tree of a volume. The contour tree acts as a visual index to volume segments, and captures associated topological attributes involved in volumetric data. A residue flow model based on Darcy's law is employed to control distributions of opacity between branches of the contour tree. Topological attributes are also used to control color selection in a perceptual color space and create harmonic color transfer functions. The generated transfer functions can depict inclusion relationship between structures and maximize opacity and color differences between them. The proposed approach allows efficient automation of transfer function generations, and exploration on the data to be carried out based on controlling of opacity residue flow rate instead of complex low-level transfer function parameter adjustments.

By visualizing changes of normal and shear stresses with respect to the principal stress directions of the physiological state, a comparative analysis of the physiological stress distribution and the stress distribution with implant is provided, and the implant parameters that most closely replicate the physiological stress state in order to avoid stress shielding can be determined. Our method combines volume rendering for the visualization of stress magnitudes with the tracing of short line segments for the visualization of stress directions. To improve depth perception, transparent, shaded, and antialiased lines are rendered in correct visibility order, and they are attenuated by the volume rendering.

Specifically, it utilizes a multi-view visualization strategy including a small multiples view of motion sequences, a parallel coordinates view, and detailed 3D inspection views. The resulting framework follows an overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand style of analysis, and it explicitly targets a limitation of current tools, namely, supporting analysis and comparison at the level of a collection of motions rather than sequential analysis of a single or small number of motions. Scientific motion collections appropriate for this style of analysis exist in clinical work in orthopedics and physical rehabilitation, in the study of functional morphology within evolutionary biology, and in other contexts. An application is described based on a collaboration with evolutionary biologists studying the mechanics of chewing motions in pigs. Interactive exploration of data describing a collection of more than one hundred experimentally captured pig chewing cycles is described.",,Daniel Keefe;Marcus Ewert;William Ribarsky;Remco Chang,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Minnesota, USA;Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Minnesota, USA;The Charlotte Visualization Center, UNC-Charlotte, USA;The Charlotte Visualization Center, UNC-Charlotte, USA",,"Scientific visualization,information visualization,coordinated multiple views,biomechanics,,,,",,43,,

In combination with a layer mechanism, our architecture facilitates generating previews incrementally to provide rich visual feedback quickly. To help avoiding common pitfalls of multi-threading, we discuss synchronization and communication in detail. We explicitly denote design choices to control trade-offs.

Previous methods for DTI fiber visualization use zooming, color-mapping, selection, and abstraction to deliver the characteristics of the fibers. However, these schemes mainly focus on the optimization of visualization in the 3D space where cluttering and occlusion make grasping even a few thousand fibers difficult. This paper introduces a novel interaction method that augments the 3D visualization with a 2D representation containing a low-dimensional embedding of the DTI fibers. This embedding preserves the relationship between the fibers and removes the visual clutter that is inherent in 3D renderings of the fibers. This new interface allows the user to manipulate the DTI fibers as both 3D curves and 2D embedded points and easily compare or validate his or her results in both domains. The implementation of the framework is GPU based to achieve real-time interaction. The framework was applied to several tasks, and the results show that our method reduces the user's workload in recognizing 3D DTI fibers and permits quick and accurate DTI fiber selection.",,Wei Chen;Zi'ang Ding;Song Zhang;Anna MacKay-Brandt;Stephen Correia;Huamin Qu;John Allen Crow;David F.

To minimize the amount of data to be streamed from disk to the graphics subsystem, we propose a visually continuous level-of-detail (LOD) particle representation based on a hierarchical quantization scheme for particle coordinates and rules for generating coarse particle distributions. Given the maximal world space error per level, our LOD selection technique guarantees a sub-pixel screen space error during rendering. A brick-based page-tree allows to further reduce the number of disk seek operations to be performed. Additional particle quantities like density, velocity dispersion, and radius are compressed at no visible loss using vector quantization of logarithmically encoded floating point values.

The benefits of visualization for synchronous group knowledge work, however, have not been addressed extensively. Anecdotal evidence and use cases illustrate the benefits of synchronous collaborative information visualization, but very few empirical studies have rigorously examined the impact of visualization on group knowledge work. We have consequently designed and conducted an experiment in which we have analyzed the impact of visualization on knowledge sharing in situated work groups. Our experimental study consists of evaluating the performance of 131 subjects (all experienced managers) in groups of 5 (for a total of 26 groups), working together on a real-life knowledge sharing task. We compare (1) the control condition (no visualization provided), with two visualization supports: (2) optimal and (3) suboptimal visualization (based on a previous survey). The facilitator of each group was asked to populate the provided interactive visual template with insights from the group, and to organize the contributions according to the group consensus. We have evaluated the results through both objective and subjective measures. Our statistical analysis clearly shows that interactive visualization has a statistically significant, objective and positive impact on the outcomes of knowledge sharing, but that the subjects seem not to be aware of this. In particular, groups supported by visualization achieved higher productivity, higher quality of outcome and greater knowledge gains. No statistically significant results could be found between an optimal and a suboptimal visualization though (as classified by the pre-experiment survey). Subjects also did not seem to be aware of the benefits that the visualizations provided as no difference between the visualization and the control conditions was found for the self-reported measures of satisfaction and participation.

This paper introduces a novel approach to represent spatial data changing over time by plotting a number of non-overlapping pixels, close to the sensor positions in a map. Thereby, we encode the amount of time that a subject spent at a particular sensor to the number of plotted pixels. Color is used in a twofold manner; while distinct colors distinguish between sensor nodes in different regions, the colors' intensity is used as an indicator to the temporal property of the subjects' activity. The resulting visualization technique, called growth ring maps, enables users to find similarities and extract patterns of interest in spatiotemporal data by using humans' perceptual abilities. We demonstrate the newly introduced technique on a dataset that shows the behavior of healthy and Alzheimer transgenic, male and female mice. We motivate the new technique by showing that the temporal analysis based on hierarchical clustering and the spatial analysis based on transition matrices only reveal limited results. Results and findings are cross-validated using multidimensional scaling.

However, the stability of the chosen parameters is not evaluated and a small change in the parameter values can give very different results. The user remains completely unaware of such effects. Furthermore, it is difficult to reproduce output results between differentusers.

The suggested approach combines the vast search and processing power of the computer with the superior reasoning and pattern recognition capabilities of the human user. An evolutionary search algorithm has been adapted to assist in the fuzzy logic formalization of hypotheses that aim at explaining features inside multivariate, volumetric data. Up to now, users solely rely on their knowledge and expertise when looking for explanatory theories. However, it often remains unclear whether the selected attribute ranges represent the real explanation for the feature of interest. Other selections hidden in the large number of data variables could potentially lead to similar features. Moreover, as simulation complexity grows, users are confronted with huge multidimensional data sets making it almost impossible to find meaningful hypotheses at all. We propose an interactive cycle of knowledge-based analysis and automatic hypothesis generation. Starting from initial hypotheses, created with linking and brushing, the user steers a heuristic search algorithm to look for alternative or related hypotheses. The results are analyzed in information visualization views that are linked to the volume rendering. Individual properties as well as global aggregates are visually presented to provide insight into the most relevant aspects of the generated hypotheses. This novel approach becomes computationally feasible due to a GPU implementation of the time-critical parts in the algorithm.

Conventionally, these methods have been treated as separate modalities, necessitating different sampling strategies and rendering algorithms. In reality, an isosurface is a special case of a transfer function, namely a Dirac impulse at a given isovalue. However, artifact-free rendering of discrete isosurfaces in a volume rendering framework is an elusive goal, requiring either infinite sampling or smoothing of the transfer function. While preintegration approaches solve the most obvious deficiencies in handling sharp transfer functions, artifacts can still result, limiting classification. In this paper, we introduce a method for rendering such features by explicitly solving for isovalues within the volume rendering integral. In addition, we present a sampling strategy inspired by ray differentials that automatically matches the frequency of the image plane, resulting in fewer artifacts near the eye and better overall performance.

They therefore mimic differential curvature, are efficient to compute, and encode anisotropy.

A key advantage of our method is that it can directly visualize higher-order state transitions. A standard first order state transition is a sequence of two states that are linked by a transition. A higher-order state transition is a sequence of three or more states where the sequence of participating states are linked together by consecutive first order state transitions. Our method extends the current state-graph exploration methods by employing a two dimensional graph, in which higher-order state transitions are visualized as curved lines. All transitions are bundled into thick splines, so that the thickness of an edge represents the frequency of instances. The bundling between two states takes into account the state transitions before and after the transition. This is done in such a way that it forms a continuous representation in which any subsequence of the timeseries is represented by a continuous smooth line. The edge bundles in these graphs can be explored interactively through our incremental selection algorithm. We demonstrate our method with an application in exploring labeled time-series data from a biological survey, where a clustering has assigned a single label to the data at each time-point.

We compare two different methods to generate a streak surface: a) by computing a patch-based surface representation that avoids any interdependence between patches, and b) by computing a particle-based surface representation including particle connectivity, and by updating this connectivity during particle refinement and coarsening. In the rendering stage, the surface is either rendered as a set of quadrilateral surface patches using high-quality point-based approaches, or a surface triangulation is built in turn from the given particle connectivity and the resulting triangle mesh is rendered. We perform a comparative study of the proposed techniques with respect to surface quality, visual quality and performance by visualizing streak surfaces in real flows using different rendering options.",,Kai Buerger;Florian Ferstl;Holger Theisel;Rüdiger Westermann,"Technische Universität München;Visual Computing Group, University of Magdeburg, Germany;Visual Computing Group, University of Magdeburg, Germany;Computer Graphics & Visualization Group, Technische Universität München, Germany",,"Unsteady flow visualization,streak surface generation,GPUs,,,,,",,28,,

While the complex nasal anatomy can be revealed by visual inspection and medical imaging, only vague information is available regarding the nasal airflow itself: Rhinomanometry delivers rather unspecific integral information on the pressure gradient as well as on total flow and nasal flow resistance. In this article we demonstrate how the understanding of physiological nasal breathing can be improved by simulating and visually analyzing nasal airflow, based on an anatomically correct model of the upper human respiratory tract. In particular we demonstrate how various information visualization (InfoVis) techniques, such as a highly scalable implementation of parallel coordinates, time series visualizations, as well as unstructured grid multi-volume rendering, all integrated within a multiple linked views framework, can be utilized to gain a deeper understanding of nasal breathing. Evaluation is accomplished by visual exploration of spatio-temporal airflow characteristics that include not only information on flow features but also on accompanying quantities such as temperature and humidity. To our knowledge, this is the first in-depth visual exploration of the physiological function of the nose over several simulated breathing cycles under consideration of a complete model of the nasal airways, realistic boundary conditions, and all physically relevant time-varying quantities.",,Stefan Zachow;Philipp Muigg;Thomas Hildebrandt;Helmut Doleisch;Hans-Christian Hege,"Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany;Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, University of Technology, Vienna, Austria;Section Brain Surgery, Asklepios Clinic Birkenwerder, Germany;SimVis GmbH, Austria;Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany",,"Flow visualization,exploratory data analysis,interactive visualFlow visualization,exploratory data analysis,interactive visual analysis of scientific data,time-dependent data.,,",,28,,

In this paper, we conjecture that this may be due to the mismatch between the high-level abstract data types commonly visualized in our field, and the low-level floating-point model supported by current GPU shader languages. To help remedy this situation, we present a refinement of the traditional information visualization pipeline that is amenable to implementation using GPU shaders. The refinement consists of a final image-space step in the pipeline where the multivariate data of the visualization is sampled in the resolution of the current view. To concretize the theoretical aspects of this work, we also present a visual programming environment for constructing visualization shaders using a simple drag-and-drop interface.

A curve-centric volume reformation deforms a volume, with regards to a curve in space, to create a new space in which the curve evaluates to zero in two dimensions and spans its arc-length in the third. The volume surrounding the curve is deformed such that spatial neighborhood to the curve is preserved. The result of the curve-centric reformation produces images where one axis is aligned to arc-length, and thus allows researchers and practitioners to apply their arc-length parameterized data visualizations in parallel for comparison. Furthermore we show that when visualizing dense data, our technique provides an inside out projection, from the curve and out into the volume, which allows for inspection what is around the curve. Finally we demonstrate the usefulness of our techniques in the context of two application cases. We show that existing data visualizations of arc-length parameterized data can be enhanced by using our techniques, in addition to creating a new view and perspective on volumetric data around curves. Additionally we show how volumetric data can be brought into plotting environments that allow precise readouts.

Several sophisticated algorithms have been proposed for constructing contour trees while they often complicate the software implementation especially for higher-dimensional cases such as time-varying volumes. This paper presents a simple yet effective approach to plotting in 3D space, approximate contour trees from a set of scattered samples embedded in the high-dimensional space. Our main idea is to take advantage of manifold learning so that we can elongate the distribution of high-dimensional data samples to embed it into a low-dimensional space while respecting its local proximity of sample points. The contribution of this paper lies in the introduction of new distance metrics to manifold learning, which allows us to reformulate existing algorithms as a variant of currently available dimensionality reduction scheme. Efficient reduction of data sizes together with segmentation capability is also developed to equip our approach with a coarse-to-fine analysis even for large-scale datasets. Examples are provided to demonstrate that our proposed scheme can successfully traverse the features of volumes and their temporal behaviors through the constructed contour trees.",,Shigeo Takahashi;Issei Fujishiro;Masato Okada,"University of Tokyo, Japan;Keio University, Japan;University of Tokyo, Japan",,"Contour trees,manifold learning,time-varying volumes,high-dimensional data analysis,,,,",,26,,

Within the theoretical framework, we further present a feature-based shape representation derived from IGSS processing, which is shown to be theoretically plausible and practically effective. By integrating the concept of scale-dependent saliency into the shape description, this representation is not only highly descriptive of the local structures, but also exhibits several desired characteristics of global shape representations, such as being compact, robust to noise and computationally efficient.

In previous studies, paper-reference matrices are usually transformed into reference-reference matrices to obtain co-citation relationships, which are then visualized in different representations, typically as node-link networks, to represent the intellectual structures of scientific domains. Such network visualizations sometimes contain tightly knit components, which make visual analysis of the intellectual structure a challenging task. In this study, we propose a new approach to reveal co-citation relationships. Instead of using a reference-reference matrix, we directly use the original paper-reference matrix as the information source, and transform the paper-reference matrix into an FP-tree and visualize it in a Java-based prototype system. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach through visual analyses of the intellectual structure of two domains: information visualization and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).

It is a tetrahedron-based rendering pipeline that projects geometry into volume images, an exact parallel to the conventional triangle-based rendering pipeline for 3D graphics. Novel features include GPU-based algorithms for real-time 4D occlusion handling and transparency compositing; we thus enable a previously impossible level of quality and interactivity for exploring lit 4D objects. The 4D tetrahedrons are stored in GPU memory as vertex buffer objects, and the vertex shader is used to perform per-vertex 4D modelview transformations and 4D-to-3D projection. The geometry shader extension is utilized to slice the projected tetrahedrons and rasterize the slices into individual 2D layers of voxel fragments. Finally, the fragment shader performs per-voxel operations such as lighting and alpha blending with previously computed layers. We account for 4D voxel occlusion along the 4D-to-3D projection ray by supporting a multi-pass back-to-front fragment composition along the projection ray; to accomplish this, we exploit a new adaptation of the dual depth peeling technique to produce correct volume image data and to simultaneously render the resulting volume data using 3D transfer functions into the final 2D image. Previous CPU implementations of the rendering of 4D-embedded 3-manifolds could not perform either the 4D depth-buffered projection or manipulation of the volume-rendered image in real-time; in particular, the dual depth peeling algorithm is a novel GPU-based solution to the real-time 4D depth-buffering problem.

This paper addresses whether the stackless traversal approaches are useful on newer hardware and technology (such as CUDA). To this end, we present a novel stackless approach for implicit kd-trees, which exploits the benefits of index-based node traversal, without incurring extra node visitation. This approach, which we term Kd-Jump, enables the traversal to immediately return to the next valid node, like a stack, without incurring extra node visitation (kd-restart). Also, Kd-Jump does not require global memory (stack) at all and only requires a small matrix in fast constant-memory. We report that Kd-Jump outperforms a stack by 10 to 20% and kd-restar t by 100%. We also present a Hybrid Kd-Jump, which utilizes a volume stepper for leaf testing and a run-time depth threshold to define where kd-tree traversal stops and volume-stepping occurs.

Such scientific scrutiny is at the heart of verifiable visualization - subjecting visualization algorithms to the same verification process that is used in other components of the scientific pipeline. More concretely, we derive formulas for the expected order of accuracy (or convergence rate) of several isosurface features, and compare them to experimentally observed results in the selected codes. This technique is practical: in two cases, it exposed actual problems in implementations. We provide the reader with the range of responses they can expect to encounter with isosurface techniques, both under ldquonormal operating conditionsrdquo and also under adverse conditions.

When moving to parallel computation, not only does the code execution need to be considered but also communication between the different processes which can induce delays that are detrimental to performance. As the number of processes increases, so does the impact of the communication delays on performance. For large-scale parallel applications, it is critical to understand how the communication impacts performance in order to make the code more efficient. There are several tools available for visualizing program execution and communications on parallel systems. These tools generally provide either views which statistically summarize the entire program execution or process-centric views. However, process-centric visualizations do not scale well as the number of processes gets very large. In particular, the most common representation of parallel processes is a Gantt chart with a row for each process.

One solution has been to use two dimensional color schemes, but the results are often hard to interpret and inaccurately read. An alternative is to use a color sequence for one variable and a texture sequence for another. This has been used, for example, in geology, but much less studied than the two dimensional color scheme, although theory suggests that it should lead to easier perceptual separation of information relating to the two variables. To make a texture sequence more clearly readable the concept of the quantitative texton sequence (QTonS) is introduced. A QTonS is defined a sequence of small graphical elements, called textons, where each texton represents a different numerical value and sets of textons can be densely displayed to produce visually differentiable textures. An experiment was carried out to compare two bivariate color coding schemes with two schemes using QTonS for one bivariate map component and a color sequence for the other. Two different key designs were investigated (a key being a sequence of colors or textures used in obtaining quantitative values from a map). The first design used two separate keys, one for each dimension, in order to measure how accurately subjects could independently estimate the underlying scalar variables. The second key design was two dimensional and intended to measure the overall integral accuracy that could be obtained. The results show that the accuracy is substantially higher for the QTonS/color sequence schemes. A hypothesis that texture/color sequence combinations are better for independent judgments of mapped quantities was supported. A second experiment probed the limits of spatial resolution for QTonSs.",,Colin Ware,"Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping, University of New Hampshire, USA",,"Bivariate maps,texture,texton,legibility,quantitative texton sequence,QTonS,,",,15,,

Indexing consists of identifying the event and people in photos. It is an integral phase that takes place before searching and sharing. In our method we use existing indexed photos to index new photos. This is performed through a manual drag and drop procedure followed by a content fusion process that we call 'propagation'. At the core of this process is the necessity to organize and visualize the photos that will be used for indexing in a manner that is easily recognizable and accessible by the user. In this respect we make use of an object Galois sub-hierarchy and display it using a Hasse diagram. The need for an incremental display that maintains the user's mental map also leads us to propose a novel way of building the Hasse diagram.

This research proposes a strategy that links an overview dendrogram and a detail-view dendrogram, each integrated with a re-orderable matrix.

It also incorporates an augmented timeline with expandable time points that better shows multiple data values for the focused time point by embedding bar charts. We applied GeneShelf to one of the largest microarray datasets generated to study the progression and recovery process of injuries at the spinal cord of mice and rats. We present a case study and a preliminary qualitative user study with biologists to show the utility and usability of GeneShelf.",,Bohyoung Kim;Bongshin Lee;Susan Knoblach;Eric Hoffman;Jinwook Seo,"Seoul National University, South Korea;Microsoft Research Limited, USA;Children''s Hospital National Medical Center, USA;Children''s Hospital National Medical Center, USA;Seoul National University, South Korea",,"bioinformatics visualization,augmented timeline,animation,zoomable grid,gene expression profiling,,,",,9,,
Vis,2009,Supercubes: A High-Level Primitive for Diamond Hierarchies,10.1109/TVCG.2009.186,https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.186,1603,1610,Journals,"Volumetric datasets are often modeled using a multiresolution approach based on a nested decomposition of the domain into a polyhedral mesh. Nested tetrahedral meshes generated through the longest edge bisection rule are commonly used to decompose regular volumetric datasets since they produce highly adaptive crack-free representations. Efficient representations for such models have been achieved by clustering the set of tetrahedra sharing a common longest edge into a structure called a diamond. The alignment and orientation of the longest edge can be used to implicitly determine the geometry of a diamond and its relations to the other diamonds within the hierarchy. We introduce the supercube as a high-level primitive within such meshes that encompasses all unique types of diamonds. A supercube is a coherent set of edges corresponding to three consecutive levels of subdivision. Diamonds are uniquely characterized by the longest edge of the tetrahedra forming them and are clustered in supercubes through the association of the longest edge of a diamond with a unique edge in a supercube. Supercubes are thus a compact and highly efficient means of associating information with a subset of the vertices, edges and tetrahedra of the meshes generated through longest edge bisection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the supercube representation when encoding multiresolution diamond hierarchies built on a subset of the points of a regular grid. We also show how supercubes can be used to efficiently extract meshes from diamond hierarchies and to reduce the storage requirements of such variable-resolution meshes.",,Kenneth Weiss;Leila De Floriani,"Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA;Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche Area di Ricerca di Napoli 1, Napoli, Campania, IT",,"Longest edge bisection,diamonds,hierarchy of diamonds,multiresolution models,selective refinement.,,,",,9,,
Vis,2009,Isosurface Extraction and View-Dependent Filtering from Time-Varying Fields Using Persistent Time-Octree (PTOT),10.1109/TVCG.2009.160,https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.160,1367,1374,Journals,"We develop a new algorithm for isosurface extraction and view-dependent filtering from large time-varying fields, by using a novel persistent time-octree (PTOT) indexing structure. Previously, the persistent octree (POT) was proposed to perform isosurface extraction and view-dependent filtering, which combines the advantages of the interval tree (for optimal searches of active cells) and of the branch-on-need octree (BONO, for view-dependent filtering), but it only works for steady-state(i.e., single time step) data. For time-varying fields, a 4D version of POT, 4D-POT, was proposed for 4D isocontour slicing, where slicing on the time domain gives all active cells in the queried timestep and isovalue. However, such slicing is not output sensitive and thus the searching is sub-optimal. Moreover, it was not known how to support view-dependent filtering in addition to time-domain slicing.In this paper, we develop a novel persistent time-octree (PTOT) indexing structure, which has the advantages of POT and performs 4D isocontour slicing on the time domain with an output-sensitive and optimal searching. In addition, when we query the same iso value q over m consecutive time steps, there is no additional searching overhead (except for reporting the additional active cells) compared to querying just the first time step. Such searching performance for finding active cells is asymptotically optimal, with asymptotically optimal space and preprocessing time as well. Moreover, our PTOT supports view-dependent filtering in addition to time-domain slicing. We propose a simple and effective out-of-core scheme, where we integrate our PTOT with implicit occluders, batched occlusion queries and batched CUDA computing tasks, so that we can greatly reduce the I/O cost as well as increase the amount of data being concurrently computed in GPU.This results in an efficient algorithm for isosurface extraction with view-dependent filtering utilizing a state-of-the-art programmable GPU for time-varying fields larger than main memory. Our experiments on datasets as large as 192 GB (with 4 GB per time step) having no more than 870 MB of memory footprint in both preprocessing and run-time phases demonstrate the efficacy of our new technique.",,Cong Wang;Yi-Jen Chiang,"CSE Department, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, Brooklyn, NY, USA;CSE Department, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, Brooklyn, NY, USA",,"Isosurface extraction,time-varying fields,persistent data structure,view-dependent filtering,out-of-core methods,,,",,9,,

Many types of chemistry simulation results are available, from atomic level bonding to volumetric representations of electron density. However, tools for the visualization of the results from quantum chemistry computations are still limited to showing atomic bonds and isosurfaces or isocontours corresponding to certain isovalues. In this work, we study the volumetric representations of the results from quantum chemistry computations, and evaluate and visualize the representations directly on the GPU without resampling the result in grid structures. Our visualization tool handles the direct evaluation of the approximated wavefunctions described as a combination of Gaussian-like primitive basis functions. For visualizations, we use a slice based volume rendering technique with a 2D transfer function, volume clipping, and illustrative rendering in order to reveal and enhance the quantum chemistry structure. Since there is no need of resampling the volume from the functional representations, two issues, data transfer and resampling resolution, can be ignored, therefore, it is possible to interactively explore large amount of different information in the computation results.",,Yun Jang;Ugo Varetto,"ETH Zürich, Switzerland;Swiss National Supercomputing Centre, Switzerland",,"Quantum Chemistry,GTO,Volume Rendering,GPU,,,,",,8,,

The underlying predictor-corrector scheme is general enough to be applied to other line-type features and it is extendable to the extraction of surfaces such as isosurfaces or Lagrangian coherent structures. The proposed method exploits temporal coherence to speed up computation for subsequent time steps. We show how the predictor-corrector formulation can be specialized for severalvariants of vortex core line definitions including two recent unsteady extensions, and we contribute a theoretical and practical comparison of these. In particular, we reveal a close relation between unsteady extensions of Fuchs et al. and Weinkauf et al. and we give a proof of the Galilean invariance of the latter.When visualizing SPH data, there is the possibility to use the same interpolation method for visualization as has been used for the simulation. This is different from the case of finite volume simulation results, where it is not possible to recover from the results the spatial interpolation that was used during the simulation. Such data are typically interpolated using the basic trilinear interpolant, and if smoothness is required, some artificial processing is added. In SPH data, however, the smoothing kernels are specified from the simulation, and they provide an exact and smooth interpolation of data or gradients at arbitrary points in the domain.",,Benjamin Schindler;Raphael Fuchs;John Biddiscombe;Ronald Peikert,"ETH, Institute of Visual Computing, Zurich, Switzerland;ETH, Institute of Visual Computing, Zurich, Switzerland;Swiss National Supercomputing Centre, Manno, Switzerland;ETH, Institute of Visual Computing, Zurich, Switzerland",,"Smoothed particle hydrodynamics,flow visualization,unsteady flow,feature extraction,vortex core lines,,,",,7,,

The basic approach of repeatedly extracting isosurfaces, illuminating them, and then building a 3D illumination grid suffers from the non-uniform sampling that arises from coupling the sampling of radiance with the sampling of isosurfaces. We demonstrate how the illumination step can be decoupled from the isosurface extraction step by illuminating the entire 3D scalar function as a 3-manifold in 4-dimensional space. By reformulating light transport in a higher dimension, one can sample a 3D volume without requiring the radiance samples to aggregate along individual isosurfaces in the pre-computed illumination grid.",,David C.

Current solutions are ineffective for visualizing fibrous structures such as muscle, because typical datasets (CT or MRI) do not contain directional details. In this paper, we introduce a new muscle illustration approach that leverages diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data and example-based texture synthesis techniques. Beginning with a volumetric diffusion tensor image, we reformulate it into a scalar field and an auxiliary guidance vector field to represent the structure and orientation of a muscle bundle. A muscle mask derived from the input diffusion tensor image is used to classify the muscle structure. The guidance vector field is further refined to remove noise and clarify structure. To simulate the internal appearance of the muscle, we propose a new two-dimensional example based solid texture synthesis algorithm that builds a solid texture constrained by the guidance vector field. Illustrating the constructed scalar field and solid texture efficiently highlights the global appearance of the muscle as well as the local shape and structure of the muscle fibers in an illustrative fashion. We have applied the proposed approach to five example datasets (four pig hearts and a pig leg), demonstrating plausible illustration and expressiveness.",,Wei Chen;Zhicheng Yan;Song Zhang;John Allen Crow;David S.

Coordinated multiple view approaches are particularly effective for visual exploration because they support precise expression of heterogeneous multidimensional queries using simple interactions. Recent visual analytics research has made significant progress in identifying and understanding patterns of composed views and coordinations that support fast, flexible, and open-ended data exploration. What is missing is formalization of the space of expressible queries in terms of visual representation and interaction. This paper introduces the conjunctive visual form model in which visual exploration consists of interactively-driven sequences of transitions between visual states that correspond to conjunctive normal forms in boolean logic. The model predicts several new and useful ways to extend the space of rapidly expressible queries through addition of simple interactive capabilities to existing compositional patterns. Two recent related visual tools offer a subset of these capabilities, providing a basis for conjecturing about such extensions.",,Chris Weaver,"School of Computer Science and the Center Spatial Analysis, University of Oklahama, USA",,"Boolean query,brushing,conjunctive normal form,exploratory visualization,multiple views,visual abstraction.,,",,7,,
