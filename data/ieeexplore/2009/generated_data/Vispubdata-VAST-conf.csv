These two views suppose different approaches to the analysis, which can yield different kinds of valuable knowledge about places and about people. We define possible types of analysis tasks related to the two views of the data and present several analysis methods appropriate for these tasks. The methods are suited to large amounts of the data.",,Gennady Andrienko;Natalia Andrienko;Peter Bak;Slava Kisilevich;Daniel Keim,"University of Bonn and Fraunhofer IAIS, Germany;University of Bonn and Fraunhofer IAIS, Germany;University of Konstanz, Germany;University of Konstanz, Germany;University of Konstanz, Germany",,",,,,,,,,",,15,,

VAST-conf,2009,Interactive poster: Interactive multiobjective optimization - a new application area for visual analytics,10.1109/VAST.2009.5333081,https://doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2009.5333081,237,238,Conferences,"The poster introduces interactive multiobjective optimization (IMO) as a field offering new application possibilities and challenges for visual analytics (VA), and aims at inspiring collaboration between the two fields. Our aim is to collect new ideas in order to be able to utilize VA techniques more effectively in our user interface development. Simulation-based IMO methods are developed for complex problem solving, where the expert decision maker (analyst) should be supported during the iterative process of eliciting preference information and examining the resulting output data. IMO is a subfield of multiple criteria decision making (MCDM). In simulation-based IMO, the optimization task is formulated in a mathematical model containing several conflicting objectives and constraints depending on decision variables. While using IMO methods the analyst progressively provides preference information in order to find the most satisfactory compromise between the conflicting objectives. In the poster, the implementations of two new IMO methods are used as examples to demonstrate concrete challenges of interaction design. One of them is described in this summary.",,Suvi Tarkkanen;Kaisa Miettinen;Jussi Hakanen,"Department of Mathematical Information Technology, University of Jyväskylä, Finland;Department of Mathematical Information Technology, University of Jyväskylä, Finland;Department of Mathematical Information Technology, University of Jyväskylä, Finland",,"Interactive multiobjective optimization,visual analytics,information visualization,interaction design,,,,,",,5,,

VAST-conf,2009,Working memory load as a novel tool for evaluating visual analytics,10.1109/VAST.2009.5333468,https://doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2009.5333468,217,218,Conferences,"The current visual analytics literature highlights design and evaluation processes that are highly variable and situation dependent, which raises at least two broad challenges. First, lack of a standardized evaluation criterion leads to costly re-designs for each task and specific user community. Second, this inadequacy in criterion validation raises significant uncertainty regarding visualization outputs and their related decisions, which may be especially troubling in high consequence environments like those of the intelligence community. As an attempt to standardize the ldquoapples and orangesrdquo of the extant situation, we propose the creation of standardized evaluation tools using general principles of human cognition. Theoretically, visual analytics enables the user to see information in a way that should attenuate the user's memory load and increase the user's task-available cognitive resources. By using general cognitive abilities like available working memory resources as our dependent measures, we propose to develop standardized evaluative capabilities that can be generalized across contexts, tasks, and user communities.",,Courtney C.

However, it is still unknown how much the interaction implicit to the interface impacts the performance of visual analysis. To show the effectiveness of two interface tools, one a floating text-based menu (Floating Menu) and the other a more interactive iconic tool (Interactive-Icon), we evaluated the use and human performance of both tools within one highly interactive visual analytics system. We asked participants to answer similarly constructed, straightforward questions in a genomic visualization, first with one tool, and then the other. During task performance we tracked completion times, task errors, and captured coarse-grained interactive behaviors. Based on the participants accuracy, speed, behaviors and post-task qualitative feedback, we observed that although the Interactive-Icon tool supports continuous interactions, task-oriented user evaluation did not find a significant difference between the two tools because there is a familiarity effect on the performance of solving the task questions with using Floating-Menu interface tool.",,Dong Hyun Jeong;Tera Marie Green;William Ribarsky;Remco Chang,"Charlotte Visualization Center, UNC-Charlotte, USA;School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University, Canada;Charlotte Visualization Center, UNC-Charlotte, USA;Charlotte Visualization Center, UNC-Charlotte, USA",,",,,,,,,,",,1,,

Numerous statistical tools and data transformations, such as projections, binning and clustering, have been coupled with visualization to help analysts understand data better and faster. However, data is inherently uncertain, due to error, noise or unreliable sources. When making decisions based on uncertain data, it is important to quantify and present to the analyst both the aggregated uncertainty of the results and the impact of the sources of that uncertainty. In this paper, we present a new framework to support uncertainty in the visual analytics process, through statistic methods such as uncertainty modeling, propagation and aggregation.

We propose a temporal categorical similarity measure, the M&M (Match & Mismatch) measure, which is based on the concept of aligning records by sentinel events, then matching events between the target and the compared records. The M&M measure combines the time differences between pairs of events and the number of mismatches. To accom-modate customization of parameters in the M&M measure and results interpretation, we implemented Similan, an interactive search and visualization tool for temporal categorical records.

Although maintaining the actual layout of the data space is often desirable, direct visualization of movement traces becomes cluttered and confusing as the spatial distribution of traces may be disparate and uneven. We present proximity-based visualization as a novel approach to the visualization of movement traces in an abstract space rather than the given spatial layout. This abstract space is obtained by considering proximity data, which is computed as the distance between entities and some number of important locations. These important locations can range from a single fixed point, to a moving point, several points, or even the proximities between the entities themselves. This creates a continuum of proximity spaces, ranging from the fixed absolute reference frame to completely relative reference frames. By combining these abstracted views with the concrete spatial views, we provide a way to mentally map the abstract spaces back to the real space.

Few visual analytics tools support this process well, nor do they provide support for visualizing and understanding the analysis process itself. To help analysts understand, explore, reference, and reuse their analysis process, we present a visual analytics system named CzSaw (See-Saw) that provides an editable and re-playable history navigation channel in addition to multiple visual representations of document collections and the entities within them (in a manner inspired by Jigsaw). Conventional history navigation tools range from basic undo and redo to branching timelines of user actions. In CzSaw's approach to this, first, user interactions are translated into a script language that drives the underlying scripting-driven propagation system. The latter allows analysts to edit analysis steps, and ultimately to program them. Second, on this base, we build both a history view showing progress and alternative paths, and a dependency graph showing the underlying logic of the analysis and dependency relations among the results of each step. These tools result in a visual model of the sense-making process, providing a way for analysts to visualize their analysis process, to reinterpret the problem, explore alternative paths, extract analysis patterns from existing history, and reuse them with other related analyses.",,Nazanin Kadivar;Victor Chen;Dustin Dunsmuir;Eric Lee;Cheryl Qian;John Dill;Christopher Shaw;Robert Woodbury,"School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University, Canada;School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University, Canada;School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University, Canada;School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University, Canada;School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University, Canada;School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University, Canada;School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University, Canada;School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University, Canada",,"Visual Analytics,Sense-making,Analysis Process,Visual History,,,,,",,44,,

Few capabilities exist to support an individual attempting to identify or understand trends and changes from streaming information over time. The burden of retaining prior information and integrating with the new is left to the skills, determination, and discipline of each individual. In this paper we present a visual analytics system for linking essential content from information streams over time into dynamic stories that develop and change over multiple days. We describe particular challenges to the analysis of streaming information and present a fundamental visual representation for showing story change and evolution over time.",,Stuart Rose;Scott Butner;Wendy Cowley;Michelle Gregory;Julia Walker,"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA;Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA;Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA;Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA;Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA",,"H.3.1 [Content Analysis and Indexing]: Abstracting methods—,H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: Information Filtering—,H.3.7 [Digital Libraries]: User Issues—,I.3.3 [Computer Graphics]: Picture/Image Generation—,,,,,",,17,,

This process is often called “connecting the dots.” When analysts interactively explore complex datasets over multiple sessions, they may uncover a large number of findings. As a result, it is often difficult for them to recall the past insights, views and concepts that are most relevant to their current line of inquiry. This challenge is even more difficult during collaborative analysis tasks where they need to find connections between their own discoveries and insights found by others. In this paper, we describe a context-based retrieval algorithm to identify notes, views and concepts from users' past analyses that are most relevant to a view or a note based on their line of inquiry. We then describe a related notes recommendation feature that surfaces the most relevant items to the user as they work based on this algorithm. We have implemented this recommendation feature in HARVEST, a web based visual analytic system. We evaluate the related notes recommendation feature of HARVEST through a case study and discuss the implications of our approach.",,Yedendra B.

One of the biggest challenges in using LSA is determining the appropriate model parameters to use for different data domains and types of analyses. Although automated methods have been developed to make rank and scaling parameter choices, these approaches often make choices with respect to noise in the data, without an understanding of how those choices impact analysis and problem solving. Further, no tools currently exist to explore the relationships between an LSA model and analysis methods. Our work focuses on how parameter choices impact analysis and problem solving. In this paper, we present LSAView, a system for interactively exploring parameter choices for LSA models. We illustrate the use of LSAView's small multiple views, linked matrix-graph views, and data views to analyze parameter selection and application in the context of graph layout and clustering.",,Patricia J.

Understanding the composition of such complexes is vital to understanding cell biology at the molecular level. MassVis is a visual analysis tool designed to assist the interpretation of data from a new workflow for detecting the composition of such protein complexes in biological samples. The data generated by the laboratory workflow naturally lends itself to a scatter plot visualization. However, characteristics of this data give rise to some unique aspects not typical of a standard scatter plot. We are able to take the output from tandem mass spectrometry and render the data in such a way that it mimics more traditional two-dimensional gel techniques and at the same time reveals the correlated behavior indicative of protein complexes. By computationally measuring these correlated patterns in the data, membership in putative complexes can be inferred. User interactions are provided to support both an interactive discovery mode as well as an unsupervised clustering of likely complexes. The specific analysis tasks led us to design a unique arrangement of item selection and coordinated detail views in order to simultaneously view different aspects of the selected item.",,Robert Kincaid;Kurt Dejgaard,"Agilent Laboratories;McGill University, Canada",,"information visualization,visual analysis,correlation analysis,mass spectrometry,proteomics,interactome,,,",,8,,

By finding unique fingerprints of RF signals received at different locations within a predefined area beforehand, whenever a similar fingerprint is subsequently seen again, the localization system will be able to infer a user's current location. However, developers of these systems face the problem of finding reliable RF fingerprints that are unique enough and adequately stable over time. We present a visual analytics system that enables developers of these localization systems to visually gain insight on whether their collected datasets and chosen fingerprint features have the necessary properties to enable a reliable RF fingerprinting-based localization system.

When performing such analysis, a genetic likelihood space is generated and sampled, which results in a multidimensional scalar field. Researchers are interested in exploring this likelihood space through the use of visualization. Previous efforts at visualizing this space, though, were slow and cumbersome, only showing a small portion of the space at a time, thus requiring the user to keep a mental picture of several views. We have developed a new technique that displays much more data at once by projecting the multidimensional data into several 2D plots. One plot is created for each parameter that shows the change along that parameter. A radial projection is used to create another plot that provides an overview of the high dimensional surface from the perspective of a single point. Linking and brushing between all the plots are used to determine relationships between parameters.

It therefore becomes more difficult to manage the networks and necessary to use time and cost effective automatic algorithms to organize the networks neighbor cell relations. There have been a number of attempts to develop such automatic algorithms. Network operators, however, may not trust them because they need to have an understanding of their behavior and of their reliability and performance, which is not easily perceived. This paper presents a novel Web-enabled geovisual analytics approach to exploration and understanding of self-organizing network data related to cells and neighbor cell relations. A demonstrator and case study are presented in this paper, developed in close collaboration with the Swedish telecom company Ericsson and based on large multivariate, time-varying and geospatial data provided by the company. It allows the operators to follow, interact with and analyze the evolution of a self-organizing network and enhance their understanding of how an automatic algorithm configures locally-unique physical cell identities and organizes neighbor cell relations of the network. The geovisual analytics tool is tested with a self-organizing network that is operated by the automatic neighbor relations (ANR) algorithm.
