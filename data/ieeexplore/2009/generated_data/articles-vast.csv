"The Internet traffic challenge required the development of a custom application to analyze internet traffic patterns coupled with building access records. To solve this challenge, the author applied the Prajna Project, an open-source Java toolkit designed to provide various capabilities for visualization, knowledge representation, semantic reasoning, and data fusion. By applying some of the capabilities of Prajna to this challenge, the author could quickly develop a custom application for visual analysis. The author determined that he could solve some of the analytical components of this challenge using automated reasoning techniques. Prajna includes interfaces to incorporate automated reasoners into visual applications. By blending the automated reasoning processes with visual analysis, the author could design a flexible, useful application to solve this challenge.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5332481/","LOCKED","5332481","Vision Systems & Technology, Inc., USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37374975000","1","Edward Swing","37374975000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","12-13 Oct. 2009","Atlantic City, NJ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2009.5332481","276","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5332481/","Information Visualization","Software Toolkit","Knowledge Representation","Semantic Reasoning","","","","","","Internet","Information filtering","Information filters","Workstations","Application software","Knowledge representation","Pattern analysis","Information analysis","","","5332407","978-1-4244-5283-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-5283-5","09EX4063","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5332481","12-13 Oct. 2009","5312461","2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2009","IEEE","1","275","Merging visual analysis with automated reasoning: Using Prajna to solve the traffic challenge"

"In visual analytics, menu systems are commonly adopted as supporting tools because of the complex nature of data. However, it is still unknown how much the interaction implicit to the interface impacts the performance of visual analysis. To show the effectiveness of two interface tools, one a floating text-based menu (Floating Menu) and the other a more interactive iconic tool (Interactive-Icon), we evaluated the use and human performance of both tools within one highly interactive visual analytics system. We asked participants to answer similarly constructed, straightforward questions in a genomic visualization, first with one tool, and then the other. During task performance we tracked completion times, task errors, and captured coarse-grained interactive behaviors. Based on the participants accuracy, speed, behaviors and post-task qualitative feedback, we observed that although the Interactive-Icon tool supports continuous interactions, task-oriented user evaluation did not find a significant difference between the two tools because there is a familiarity effect on the performance of solving the task questions with using Floating-Menu interface tool.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333469/","LOCKED","5333469","Charlotte Visualization Center, UNC Charlotte, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37400451800","1","Dong Hyun Jeong","37400451800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University, Canada","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403562900","2","Tera Marie Green","37403562900","Charlotte Visualization Center, UNC Charlotte, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300425000","3","William Ribarsky","37300425000","Charlotte Visualization Center, UNC Charlotte, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592409400","4","Remco Chang","37592409400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","0","12-13 Oct. 2009","Atlantic City, NJ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2009.5333469","220","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333469/","","","","","","","","","","Visual analytics","Organisms","Bioinformatics","Performance analysis","Humans","Genomics","Phylogeny","Data visualization","Cognition","Art","5332407","978-1-4244-5283-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-5283-5","09EX4063","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333469","12-13 Oct. 2009","5312461","2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2009","IEEE","4","219","Comparing two interface tools in performing visual analytics tasks"
"The classic TileBars paradigm has been used to show distribution information of query terms in full-text documents. However, when the number of query terms becomes large, it is not an easy task for users to comprehend their distribution within certain parts of a document. In this paper, we present a novel approach to improve the visual presentation of TileBars, in which barycenter heuristic for bigraph crossing minimization is used to reorder TileBars elements. The reordered TileBars can be demonstrated to provide users with better focus and navigation while exploring text documents.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333436/","LOCKED","5333436","Digital Enterprise Research Institute, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37667058500","1","VinhTuan Thai","37667058500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Digital Enterprise Research Institute, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37661704100","2","Siegfried Handschuh","37661704100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1","12-13 Oct. 2009","Atlantic City, NJ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2009.5333436","226","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333436/","H.5.2 [Information interfaces and presentation]: User Interfaces","Graphical user interfaces","","","","","","","","Frequency","Navigation","Bipartite graph","Visual analytics","Ontologies","User interfaces","Pattern analysis","Smoothing methods","Bars","Prototypes","5332407","978-1-4244-5283-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-5283-5","09EX4063","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333436","12-13 Oct. 2009","5312461","2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2009","IEEE","5","225","Reordered tilebars for visual text exploration"

"Complex scenario analysis requires the exploration of multiple hypotheses and supporting evidence for each argument posed. Knowledge-intensive organisations typically analyse large amounts of inter-related, heterogeneous data to retrieve the knowledge this contains and use it to support effective decision-making. We demonstrate the use of interactive graph visualisation to support hierarchical, task-driven, hypothesis investigation. The visual investigative analysis is guided by task and domain ontologies used to capture the structure of the investigation process and the experience gained and knowledge created in previous, related investigations.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333438/","LOCKED","5333438","Dept. of Information Studies, The University of Sheffield, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681297400","1","Aba-Sah Dadzie","37681297400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dept. of Information Studies, The University of Sheffield, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681293700","2","Daniela Petrelli","37681293700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","12-13 Oct. 2009","Atlantic City, NJ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2009.5333438","228","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333438/","H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: User Interfaces—Graphical user interfaces (GUI)","K.6.1 [Management of Computing and Information Systems]: Project and People Management—Life Cycle","","","","","","","","Information retrieval","Ontologies","Information analysis","Bicycles","Visualization","Project management","Failure analysis","Assembly systems","Computer science","Decision making","5332407","978-1-4244-5283-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-5283-5","09EX4063","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333438","12-13 Oct. 2009","5312461","2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2009","IEEE","7","227","Visual knowledge exploration and discovery from different points of view"
"Processing is a very powerful visualization language which combines software concepts with principles of visual form and interaction. Artists, designers and architects use it but it is also a very effective programming language in the area of visual analytics. In the following contribution Processing is utilized in order to visually analyze data provided by IEEE VAST 2009 Mini Challenge Badge and Network Traffic. The applied process is iterative and each stage of the analytical reasoning process is accompanied by customized software development. The visual model, the process and the technical solution will be briefly introduced.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5334463/","LOCKED","5334463","Carnegie Mellon University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38273811400","1","Claudia Muller-Birn","38273811400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Capgemini sd&m AG, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38270552500","2","Lukas Birn","38270552500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","12-13 Oct. 2009","Atlantic City, NJ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2009.5334463","252","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5334463/","H.1.2 [User/Machine Systems]: Visual Analytics","D.2.3 [Coding Tools and Techniques]: Object-oriented programming","","","","","","","","Programming","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Data visualization","Visual analytics","Object oriented modeling","Software tools","Computer languages","","","5332407","978-1-4244-5283-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-5283-5","09EX4063","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5334463","12-13 Oct. 2009","5312461","2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2009","IEEE","8","251","Combining iterative analytical reasoning and software development using the visualization language Processing"

The Cluster Division component, the Bead Shape Identification and Cluster Shape Composition form the core of the system. BEADS visualization consists of a 2-D plot, standard 2-D shapes which are used as metaphors to represent corresponding high-dimensional shapes of beads. The final resulting images convey the relative placement of beads with respect to the cluster center, the shape of the beads. We give a textual summary of the beads and their 2-D placement on the Beads plot in tabular format along with the image.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333417/","LOCKED","5333417","Centre for Data Engineering, International Institute of Information Technology-Hyderabad, INDIA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681354900","1","Soujanya Vadapalli","37681354900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Centre for Data Engineering, International Institute of Information Technology-Hyderabad, INDIA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37281960300","2","Kamalakar Karlapalem","37281960300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","12-13 Oct. 2009","Atlantic City, NJ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2009.5333417","236","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333417/","","","","","","","","","","Data visualization","Shape","Clustering algorithms","Partitioning algorithms","Data engineering","Testing","Image representation","Computer displays","","","5332407","978-1-4244-5283-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-5283-5","09EX4063","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333417","12-13 Oct. 2009","5312461","2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2009","IEEE","11","235","BEADS: High dimensional data cluster visualization"
"In modern process industry, it is often difficult to analyze a manufacture process due to its numerous time-series data. Analysts wish to not only interpret the evolution of data over time in a working procedure, but also examine the changes in the whole production process through time. To meet such analytic requirements, we have developed ProcessLine, an interactive visualization tool for a large amount of time-series data in process industry. The data are displayed in a fisheye timeline. ProcessLine provides good overviews for the whole production process and details for the focused working procedure.

"As a solution to the VAST 2009 Traffic Mini Visualization Challenge, we built the Badge and Network Traffic (BNT) tool to create animations of the events taking place in the embassy. Using the embassy layout, the prox-card and web-access entries and their time-stamps, we animated color-based flagging of events. The BNT tool highlights logical anomalies occuring in the badge and network traffic data with color-coded alerts. Prior to the animated visualization, the tool analyzes data with respect to various aspects using (i) the amount of data transfers, (ii) destination IPs access patterns, (iii) employee's browsing patterns and (iv) employee's entry log into the restricted area. Any abnormality noticed is immediately reported to the user in the form of plots. In this presentation, we list out the various analyses performed and how they were utilized in the visualization.

"A team of five worked on this challenge to identify a possible criminal structure within the Flitter social network. Initially we worked on the problem individually, deliberately not sharing any data, results or conclusions. This maximised the chances of spotting any blunders, unjustified assumptions or inferences and allowed us to triangulate any common conclusions. After an agreed period we shared our results demonstrating the visualization applications we had built and the reasoning behind our conclusions. This sharing of assumptions encouraged us to incorporate uncertainty in our visualization approaches as it became clear that there was a number of possible interpretations of the rules and assumptions governing the challenge. This summary of the work emphasises one of those applications detailing the geographic analysis and uncertainty handling of the network data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333965/","LOCKED","5333965","School of Informatics, City University London, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399045100","1","Jo Wood","37399045100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","School of Informatics, City University London, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590960700","2","Aidan Slingsby","37590960700","School of Informatics, City University London, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38272131500","3","Naz Khalili-Shavarini","38272131500","School of Informatics, City University London, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37605079900","4","Jason Dykes","37605079900","School of Informatics, City University London, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37370770900","5","David Mountain","37370770900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","12-13 Oct. 2009","Atlantic City, NJ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2009.5333965","262","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333965/","","","","","","","","","","Data visualization","Data analysis","Cities and towns","Electronic mail","Geography","Informatics","Social network services","Databases","Performance analysis","","5332407","978-1-4244-5283-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-5283-5","09EX4063","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333965","12-13 Oct. 2009","5312461","2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2009","IEEE","15","261","Visualization of uncertainty and analysis of geographical data"

"The current visual analytics literature highlights design and evaluation processes that are highly variable and situation dependent, which raises at least two broad challenges. First, lack of a standardized evaluation criterion leads to costly re-designs for each task and specific user community. Second, this inadequacy in criterion validation raises significant uncertainty regarding visualization outputs and their related decisions, which may be especially troubling in high consequence environments like those of the intelligence community. As an attempt to standardize the ldquoapples and orangesrdquo of the extant situation, we propose the creation of standardized evaluation tools using general principles of human cognition. Theoretically, visual analytics enables the user to see information in a way that should attenuate the user's memory load and increase the user's task-available cognitive resources. By using general cognitive abilities like available working memory resources as our dependent measures, we propose to develop standardized evaluative capabilities that can be generalized across contexts, tasks, and user communities.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333468/","LOCKED","5333468","Sandia National Laboratories, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681577100","1","Courtney C.

These two views suppose different approaches to the analysis, which can yield different kinds of valuable knowledge about places and about people.

"The poster introduces interactive multiobjective optimization (IMO) as a field offering new application possibilities and challenges for visual analytics (VA), and aims at inspiring collaboration between the two fields. Our aim is to collect new ideas in order to be able to utilize VA techniques more effectively in our user interface development. Simulation-based IMO methods are developed for complex problem solving, where the expert decision maker (analyst) should be supported during the iterative process of eliciting preference information and examining the resulting output data. IMO is a subfield of multiple criteria decision making (MCDM). In simulation-based IMO, the optimization task is formulated in a mathematical model containing several conflicting objectives and constraints depending on decision variables. While using IMO methods the analyst progressively provides preference information in order to find the most satisfactory compromise between the conflicting objectives. In the poster, the implementations of two new IMO methods are used as examples to demonstrate concrete challenges of interaction design. One of them is described in this summary.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333081/","LOCKED","5333081","Department of Mathematical Information Technology, University of Jyväskylä, Finland","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681626500","1","Suvi Tarkkanen","37681626500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Department of Mathematical Information Technology, University of Jyväskylä, Finland","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546691200","2","Kaisa Miettinen","37546691200","Department of Mathematical Information Technology, University of Jyväskylä, Finland","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681627000","3","Jussi Hakanen","37681627000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5","0","12-13 Oct. 2009","Atlantic City, NJ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2009.5333081","238","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333081/","Interactive multiobjective optimization","visual analytics","information visualization","interaction design","","","","","","Visual analytics","Information analysis","Collaboration","User interfaces","Analytical models","Problem-solving","Iterative methods","Decision making","Constraint optimization","Mathematical model","5332407","978-1-4244-5283-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-5283-5","09EX4063","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333081","12-13 Oct. 2009","5312461","2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2009","IEEE","20","237","Interactive poster: Interactive multiobjective optimization - a new application area for visual analytics"
"Although many in the community have advocated user-centered evaluations for visual analytic environments, a significant barrier exists. The users targeted by the visual analytics community (law enforcement personnel, professional information analysts, financial analysts, health care analysts, etc.) are often inaccessible to researchers. These analysts are extremely busy and their work environments and data are often classified or at least confidential. Furthermore, their tasks often last weeks or even months. It is simply not feasible to do such long-term observations to understand their jobs. How then can we hope to gather enough information about the diverse user populations to understand their needs? Some researchers, including the author, have been successful in getting access to specific end-users. A reasonable approach, therefore, would be to find a way to share user information. This work outlines a proposal for developing a handbook of user profiles for use by researchers, developers, and evaluators.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333474/","LOCKED","5333474","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268671300","1","Jean Scholtz","37268671300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","12-13 Oct. 2009","Atlantic City, NJ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2009.5333474","216","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333474/","user-centered evaluation","visual analytics","user requirements","","","","","","","Proposals","Visual analytics","Information analysis","Visualization","Law enforcement","Best practices","Personnel","Medical services","User interfaces","Social network services","5332407","978-1-4244-5283-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-5283-5","09EX4063","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333474","12-13 Oct. 2009","5312461","2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2009","IEEE","21","215","Interactive poster: A proposal for sharing user requirements for visual analytic tools"

"We hypothesized that potential spies would try to use other employees' terminals in order to not draw attention to themselves. We define one type of suspicious activity as IP use on a terminal when the owner is inside the classified area. We created a timeline visualization of IP usage, overlaid with classified area entrances and exits. The vertical axis divides the timelines into 31 rows, one for each day of the month. The horizontal axis represents the time of day from early morning to late evening. A single employee's entire month is viewed all at once using this visualization. The employee being viewed can be changed using the arrow keys. Every IP event is represented by a vertical bar positioned at the exact time of its appearance. We color the IP events by port number, which is either intranet, HTTP, tomcat, or email, and size the bar based on the outgoing data size. Whenever an employee enters the classified area, a semi-transparent yellow region is drawn until that user exits the classified area. In rare cases when the user double enters, the region is twice as opaque, and in the other rare case where a user leaves the exits without entering, a red region is drawn until the next time the employee enters. The legend key and office diagram showing the current selected employee, highlighted in red, can be seen in the top left-hand corner.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333950/","LOCKED","5333950","VIDI Group, University of California, Davis, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37598134900","1","Chad Jones","37598134900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","VIDI Group, University of California, Davis, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37287357700","2","Michael Ogawa","37287357700","VIDI Group, University of California, Davis, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38181769500","3","James Shearer","38181769500","VIDI Group, University of California, Davis, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37404049100","4","Anna Tikhonova","37404049100","VIDI Group, University of California, Davis, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275869400","5","Kwan-Liu Ma","37275869400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","12-13 Oct. 2009","Atlantic City, NJ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2009.5333950","258","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333950/","","","","","","","","","","Surveillance","Packaging","Visualization","Computer security","Cameras","Software packages","Robustness","","","","5332407","978-1-4244-5283-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-5283-5","09EX4063","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333950","12-13 Oct. 2009","5312461","2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2009","IEEE","26","257","VIDI surveillance - embassy monitoring and oversight system"
"Intelligence analysts in the areas of defense and homeland security are now faced with the difficult problem of discerning the relevant details amidst massive data stores. We propose a component-based visualization architecture that is built specifically to encourage the flexible exploration of geospatial event databases. The proposed system is designed to deploy on a variety of display layouts, from a single laptop screen to a multi-monitor tiled-display. By utilizing a combination of parallel coordinates, principal components plots, and other data views, analysts may reduce the dimensionality of a data set to its most salient features. Of particular value to our target applications are understanding correlations between data layers, both within a single view and across multiple views. Our proposed system aims to address the limited scalability associated with coordinated multiple views (CMVs) through the implementation of an efficient core application which is extensible by the end-user.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333451/","LOCKED","5333451","Naval Research Laboratory, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681593700","1","Jonathan Decker","37681593700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Naval Research Laboratory, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38557639600","2","Alex Godwin","38557639600","Naval Research Laboratory, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300434300","3","Mark A.

The grand challenge required integrating the findings from the mini challenges into a plausible, consistent scenario. A mixture of linked, customized tools based on queryable models and rapid prototyping as well as generic analysis tools (developed in-house) helped us correctly solve all of the mini challenges.

"The IEEE Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST) Symposium has held a contest each year since its inception in 2006. These events are designed to provide visual analytics researchers and developers with analytic challenges similar to those encountered by professional information analysts. The VAST contest has had an extended life outside of the symposium, however, as materials are being used in universities and other educational settings, either to help teachers of visual analytics-related classes or for student projects. We describe how we develop VAST contest datasets that results in products that can be used in different settings and review some specific examples of the adoption of the VAST contest materials in the classroom. The examples are drawn from graduate and undergraduate courses at Virginia Tech and from the Visual Analytics ldquoSummer Camprdquo run by the National Visualization and Analytics Center in 2008.

"In this paper, we present a system for the interactive visualization and exploration of graphs with many weakly connected components. The visualization of large graphs has recently received much research attention. However, specific systems for visual analysis of graph data sets consisting of many components are rare. In our approach, we rely on graph clustering using an extensive set of topology descriptors. Specifically, we use the self-organizing-map algorithm in conjunction with a user-adaptable combination of graph features for clustering of graphs. It offers insight into the overall structure of the data set. The clustering output is presented in a grid containing clusters of the connected components of the input graph. Interactive feature selection and task-tailored data views allow the exploration of the whole graph space. The system provides also tools for assessment and display of cluster quality. We demonstrate the usefulness of our system by application to a shareholder network analysis problem based on a large real-world data set. While so far our approach is applied to weighted directed graphs only, it can be used for various graph types.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333893/","LOCKED","5333893","Interactive Graphics Systems Group, Technische Universität Darmstadt and Fraunhofer IGD, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586276100","1","Tatiana von Landesberger","37586276100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Interactive Graphics Systems Group, Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37683615400","2","Melanie Gorner","37683615400","Interactive Graphics Systems Group, Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282557600","3","Tobias Schreck","37282557600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","19","1","12-13 Oct. 2009","Atlantic City, NJ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2009.5333893","162","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333893/","E.1 [Data Structures]: Graphs and Networks","[H.3.3]: Information Search and Retrieval","Clustering H.5.2 [User Interfaces]: Graphical user interfaces (GUI)","[I.3.3]: COMPUTER GRAPHICS","Picture/Image Generation","","","","","Data visualization","Graphics","Clustering algorithms","Data analysis","Topology","Displays","Data structures","Information retrieval","Image retrieval","User interfaces","5332407","978-1-4244-5283-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-5283-5","09EX4063","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333893","12-13 Oct. 2009","5312461","2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2009","IEEE","33","155","Visual analysis of graphs with multiple connected components"
"Protein complexes are formed when two or more proteins non-covalently interact to form a larger three dimensional structure with specific biological function. Understanding the composition of such complexes is vital to understanding cell biology at the molecular level. MassVis is a visual analysis tool designed to assist the interpretation of data from a new workflow for detecting the composition of such protein complexes in biological samples. The data generated by the laboratory workflow naturally lends itself to a scatter plot visualization. However, characteristics of this data give rise to some unique aspects not typical of a standard scatter plot. We are able to take the output from tandem mass spectrometry and render the data in such a way that it mimics more traditional two-dimensional gel techniques and at the same time reveals the correlated behavior indicative of protein complexes.

"The increasing availability of motion sensors and video cameras in living spaces has made possible the analysis of motion patterns and collective behavior in a number of situations. The visualization of this movement data, however, remains a challenge. Although maintaining the actual layout of the data space is often desirable, direct visualization of movement traces becomes cluttered and confusing as the spatial distribution of traces may be disparate and uneven. We present proximity-based visualization as a novel approach to the visualization of movement traces in an abstract space rather than the given spatial layout. This abstract space is obtained by considering proximity data, which is computed as the distance between entities and some number of important locations. These important locations can range from a single fixed point, to a moving point, several points, or even the proximities between the entities themselves. This creates a continuum of proximity spaces, ranging from the fixed absolute reference frame to completely relative reference frames. By combining these abstracted views with the concrete spatial views, we provide a way to mentally map the abstract spaces back to the real space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, and its applicability to visual analytics problems such as hazard prevention, migration patterns, and behavioral studies.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5332593/","LOCKED","5332593","University of California, Davis, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37597152500","1","Tarik Crnovrsanin","37597152500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of California, Davis, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37299311900","2","Chris Muelder","37299311900","University of California, Davis, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282925900","3","Carlos Correa","37282925900","University of California, Davis, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275869400","4","Kwan-Liu Ma","37275869400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","45","2","12-13 Oct. 2009","Atlantic City, NJ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2009.5332593","18","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5332593/","Spatio-temporal visualization","proximity","linked views","principal component analysis","temporal trajectories","movement patterns","","","","Data visualization","Motion analysis","Principal component analysis","Availability","Cameras","Pattern analysis","Concrete","Visual analytics","Hazards","Multidimensional systems","5332407","978-1-4244-5283-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-5283-5","09EX4063","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5332593","12-13 Oct. 2009","5312461","2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2009","IEEE","35","11","Proximity-based visualization of movement trace data"
"Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is a commonly-used method for automated processing, modeling, and analysis of unstructured text data. One of the biggest challenges in using LSA is determining the appropriate model parameters to use for different data domains and types of analyses. Although automated methods have been developed to make rank and scaling parameter choices, these approaches often make choices with respect to noise in the data, without an understanding of how those choices impact analysis and problem solving. Further, no tools currently exist to explore the relationships between an LSA model and analysis methods. Our work focuses on how parameter choices impact analysis and problem solving. In this paper, we present LSAView, a system for interactively exploring parameter choices for LSA models. We illustrate the use of LSAView's small multiple views, linked matrix-graph views, and data views to analyze parameter selection and application in the context of graph layout and clustering.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333428/","LOCKED","5333428","Sandia National Laboratories, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282576500","1","Patricia J.

"An increasing number of temporal categorical databases are being collected: Electronic Health Records in healthcare organizations, traffic incident logs in transportation systems, or student records in universities. Finding similar records within these large databases requires effective similarity measures that capture the searcher's intent. Many similarity measures exist for numerical time series, but temporal categorical records are different. We propose a temporal categorical similarity measure, the M&M (Match & Mismatch) measure, which is based on the concept of aligning records by sentinel events, then matching events between the target and the compared records. The M&M measure combines the time differences between pairs of events and the number of mismatches. To accom-modate customization of parameters in the M&M measure and results interpretation, we implemented Similan, an interactive search and visualization tool for temporal categorical records. A usability study with 8 participants demonstrated that Similan was easy to learn and enabled them to find similar records, but users had difficulty understanding the M&M measure. The usability study feedback, led to an improved version with a continuous timeline, which was tested in a pilot study with 5 participants.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5332595/","LOCKED","5332595","Department of Computer Science & Human-Computer Interaction Lab, University of Maryland, College Park, 20742, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37670523200","1","Krist Wongsuphasawat","37670523200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Department of Computer Science & Human-Computer Interaction Lab, University of Maryland, College Park, 20742, USA","","2","Ben Shneiderman","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","45","1","12-13 Oct. 2009","Atlantic City, NJ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2009.5332595","34","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5332595/","Similan","M&M Measure","Similarity Search","Temporal Categorical Records","","","","","","Visualization","Visual databases","Time measurement","Usability","Medical services","Transportation","Educational institutions","Particle measurements","Feedback","Testing","5332407","978-1-4244-5283-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-5283-5","09EX4063","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5332595","12-13 Oct. 2009","5312461","2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2009","IEEE","37","27","Finding comparable temporal categorical records: A similarity measure with an interactive visualization"
"In this paper, we discuss dimension reduction methods for 2D visualization of high dimensional clustered data. We propose a two-stage framework for visualizing such data based on dimension reduction methods. In the first stage, we obtain the reduced dimensional data by applying a supervised dimension reduction method such as linear discriminant analysis which preserves the original cluster structure in terms of its criteria. The resulting optimal reduced dimension depends on the optimization criteria and is often larger than 2. In the second stage, the dimension is further reduced to 2 for visualization purposes by another dimension reduction method such as principal component analysis. The role of the second-stage is to minimize the loss of information due to reducing the dimension all the way to 2. Using this framework, we propose several two-stage methods, and present their theoretical characteristics as well as experimental comparisons on both artificial and real-world text data sets.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5332629/","LOCKED","5332629","College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, 266 Ferst Drive, Atlanta, 30332, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37602784600","1","Jaegul Choo","37602784600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","National Visualization and Analytics Center, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, 902 Battelle Blvd, Richland, WA 99354, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37648561300","2","Shawn Bohn","37648561300","College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, 266 Ferst Drive, Atlanta, 30332, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37277119500","3","Haesun Park","37277119500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","30","0","12-13 Oct. 2009","Atlantic City, NJ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2009.5332629","74","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5332629/","dimension reduction","linear discriminant analysis","principal component analysis","orthogonal centroid method","2D projection","clustered data","regularization","generalized singular value decomposition","","Data visualization","Principal component analysis","Linear discriminant analysis","Educational institutions","Drives","Visual analytics","Information analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Scattering","Laboratories","5332407","978-1-4244-5283-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-5283-5","09EX4063","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5332629","12-13 Oct. 2009","5312461","2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2009","IEEE","38","67","Two-stage framework for visualization of clustered high dimensional data"
"This paper presents a working graph analytics model that embraces the strengths of the traditional top-down and bottom-up approaches with a resilient crossover concept to exploit the vast middle-ground information overlooked by the two extreme analytical approaches. Our graph analytics model is co-developed by users and researchers, who carefully studied the functional requirements that reflect the critical thinking and interaction pattern of a real-life intelligence analyst. To evaluate the model, we implement a system prototype, known as GreenHornet, which allows our analysts to test the theory in practice, identify the technological and usage-related gaps in the model, and then adapt the new technology in their work space. The paper describes the implementation of GreenHornet and compares its strengths and weaknesses against the other prevailing models and tools.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333880/","LOCKED","5333880","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38193849400","1","Pak Chung Wong","38193849400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550755900","2","Patrick Mackey","37550755900","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564931700","3","Kristin A.

"Visual analytics tools provide powerful visual representations in order to support the sense-making process. In this process, analysts typically iterate through sequences of steps many times, varying parameters each time. Few visual analytics tools support this process well, nor do they provide support for visualizing and understanding the analysis process itself. To help analysts understand, explore, reference, and reuse their analysis process, we present a visual analytics system named CzSaw (See-Saw) that provides an editable and re-playable history navigation channel in addition to multiple visual representations of document collections and the entities within them (in a manner inspired by Jigsaw). Conventional history navigation tools range from basic undo and redo to branching timelines of user actions. In CzSaw's approach to this, first, user interactions are translated into a script language that drives the underlying scripting-driven propagation system. The latter allows analysts to edit analysis steps, and ultimately to program them. Second, on this base, we build both a history view showing progress and alternative paths, and a dependency graph showing the underlying logic of the analysis and dependency relations among the results of each step. These tools result in a visual model of the sense-making process, providing a way for analysts to visualize their analysis process, to reinterpret the problem, explore alternative paths, extract analysis patterns from existing history, and reuse them with other related analyses.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333020/","LOCKED","5333020","School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University, Canada","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681588600","1","Nazanin Kadivar","37681588600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University, Canada","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38182637400","2","Victor Chen","38182637400","School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University, Canada","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601085600","3","Dustin Dunsmuir","37601085600","School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University, Canada","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37596074400","4","Eric Lee","37596074400","School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University, Canada","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38585310400","5","Cheryl Qian","38585310400","School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University, Canada","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37278563100","6","John Dill","37278563100","School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University, Canada","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37358198200","7","Christopher Shaw","37358198200","School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University, Canada","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38181028300","8","Robert Woodbury","38181028300","","","","","","","","","","","36","0","12-13 Oct. 2009","Atlantic City, NJ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2009.5333020","138","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333020/","Visual Analytics","Sense-making","Analysis Process","Visual History","","","","","","History","Visual analytics","Pattern analysis","Information analysis","Failure analysis","Data visualization","Navigation","Logic","Graphical user interfaces","Art","5332407","978-1-4244-5283-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-5283-5","09EX4063","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333020","12-13 Oct. 2009","5312461","2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2009","IEEE","40","131","Capturing and supporting the analysis process"
"Cellular radio networks are continually growing in both node count and complexity. It therefore becomes more difficult to manage the networks and necessary to use time and cost effective automatic algorithms to organize the networks neighbor cell relations. There have been a number of attempts to develop such automatic algorithms. Network operators, however, may not trust them because they need to have an understanding of their behavior and of their reliability and performance, which is not easily perceived. This paper presents a novel Web-enabled geovisual analytics approach to exploration and understanding of self-organizing network data related to cells and neighbor cell relations. A demonstrator and case study are presented in this paper, developed in close collaboration with the Swedish telecom company Ericsson and based on large multivariate, time-varying and geospatial data provided by the company. It allows the operators to follow, interact with and analyze the evolution of a self-organizing network and enhance their understanding of how an automatic algorithm configures locally-unique physical cell identities and organizes neighbor cell relations of the network. The geovisual analytics tool is tested with a self-organizing network that is operated by the automatic neighbor relations (ANR) algorithm. The demonstrator has been tested with positive results by a group of domain experts from Ericsson and will be tested in production.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5332610/","LOCKED","5332610","National Center for Visual Analytics, Dept. of Science and Technology, Linköping University, Sweden","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087652378","1","Van Quan Ho","37087652378","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","National Center for Visual Analytics, Dept. of Science and Technology, Linköping University, Sweden","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37669906900","2","Tobias Astrom","37669906900","National Center for Visual Analytics, Dept. of Science and Technology, Linköping University, Sweden","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283245900","3","Mikael Jern","37283245900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","12-13 Oct. 2009","Atlantic City, NJ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2009.5332610","50","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5332610/","Geovisual analytics","visualization","self-organizing network","multi-layer","multi-dimensional","time-varying","geospatial data sets","","","Self-organizing networks","Information analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Data analysis","Data visualization","Testing","Visual analytics","Pattern analysis","Filtering","Large-scale systems","5332407","978-1-4244-5283-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-5283-5","09EX4063","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5332610","12-13 Oct. 2009","5312461","2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2009","IEEE","41","43","Geovisual analytics for self-organizing network data"
"Despite the growing number of systems providing visual analytic support for investigative analysis, few empirical studies of the potential benefits of such systems have been conducted, particularly controlled, comparative evaluations. Determining how such systems foster insight and sensemaking is important for their continued growth and study, however. Furthermore, studies that identify how people use such systems and why they benefit (or not) can help inform the design of new systems in this area. We conducted an evaluation of the visual analytics system Jigsaw employed in a small investigative sensemaking exercise, and we compared its use to three other more traditional methods of analysis. Sixteen participants performed a simulated intelligence analysis task under one of the four conditions. Experimental results suggest that Jigsaw assisted participants to analyze the data and identify an embedded threat. We describe different analysis strategies used by study participants and how computational support (or the lack thereof) influenced the strategies. We then illustrate several characteristics of the sensemaking process identified in the study and provide design implications for investigative analysis tools based thereon. We conclude with recommendations for metrics and techniques for evaluating other visual analytics investigative analysis tools.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333878/","LOCKED","5333878","School of Interactive Computing & GVU Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37673524700","1","Youn-ah Kang","37673524700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","School of Interactive Computing & GVU Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37428446300","2","Carsten Gorg","37428446300","School of Interactive Computing & GVU Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267736900","3","John Stasko","37267736900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","36","1","12-13 Oct. 2009","Atlantic City, NJ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2009.5333878","146","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333878/","","","","","","","","","","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Control systems","Performance analysis","Data analysis","Information analysis","Electronic mail","Guidelines","Collaborative work","Collaborative tools","5332407","978-1-4244-5283-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-5283-5","09EX4063","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333878","12-13 Oct. 2009","5312461","2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2009","IEEE","42","139","Evaluating visual analytics systems for investigative analysis: Deriving design principles from a case study"
"FinVis is a visual analytics tool that allows the non-expert casual user to interpret the return, risk and correlation aspects of financial data and make personal finance decisions. This interactive exploratory tool helps the casual decision-maker quickly choose between various financial portfolio options and view possible outcomes. FinVis allows for exploration of inter-temporal data to analyze outcomes of short-term or long-term investment decisions. FinVis helps the user overcome cognitive limitations and understand the impact of correlation between financial instruments in order to reap the benefits of portfolio diversification. Because this software is accessible by non-expert users, decision-makers from the general population can benefit greatly from using FinVis in practical applications. We quantify the value of FinVis using experimental economics methods and find that subjects using the FinVis software make better financial portfolio decisions as compared to subjects using a tabular version with the same information. We also find that FinVis engages the user, which results in greater exploration of the dataset and increased learning as compared to a tabular display. Further, participants using FinVis reported increased confidence in financial decision-making and noted that they were likely to use this tool in practical application.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333920/","LOCKED","5333920","Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center (PURVAC), USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396006000","1","Stephen Rudolph","37396006000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Purdue University Department of Economics, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681662800","2","Anya Savikhin","37681662800","Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center (PURVAC), USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282598900","3","David S.

"Patents are an important economic factor in todays globalized markets. Therefore, the analysis of patent information has become an inevitable task for a variety of interest groups. The retrieval of relevant patent information is an integral part of almost every patent analysis scenario. Unfortunately, the complexity of patent material inhibits a straightforward retrieval of all relevant patent documents and leads to iterative, time-consuming approaches in practice. With `PatViz', a new system for interactive analysis of patent information has been developed to leverage iterative query refinement. PatViz supports users in building complex queries visually and in exploring patent result sets interactively. Thereby, the visual query module introduces an abstraction layer that provides uniform access to different retrieval systems and relieves users of the burden to learn different complex query languages. By establishing an integrated environment it allows for interactive reintegration of insights gained from visual result set exploration into the visual query representation. We expect that the approach we have taken is also suitable to improve iterative query refinement in other Visual Analytics systems.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333564/","LOCKED","5333564","Visualization and Interactive Systems Group, Universität Stuttgart, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593029700","1","Steffen Koch","37593029700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Visualization and Interactive Systems Group, Universität Stuttgart, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37683989300","2","Harald Bosch","37683989300","Visualization and Interactive Systems Group, Universität Stuttgart, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681276000","3","Mark Giereth","37681276000","Visualization and Interactive Systems Group, Universität Stuttgart, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268023800","4","Thomas Ertl","37268023800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","16","0","12-13 Oct. 2009","Atlantic City, NJ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2009.5333564","210","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333564/","Patent retrieval","information visualization","visual analytics","multiple coordinated views","","","","","","Information analysis","Information retrieval","Visualization","Visual analytics","Companies","Environmental economics","Iterative methods","Intellectual property","Interactive systems","Database languages","5332407","978-1-4244-5283-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-5283-5","09EX4063","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333564","12-13 Oct. 2009","5312461","2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2009","IEEE","44","203","Iterative integration of visual insights during patent search and analysis"
"One of the most common operations in exploration and analysis of various kinds of data is clustering, i.e. discovery and interpretation of groups of objects having similar properties and/or behaviors. In clustering, objects are often treated as points in multi-dimensional space of properties. However, structurally complex objects, such as trajectories of moving entities and other kinds of spatio-temporal data, cannot be adequately represented in this manner. Such data require sophisticated and computationally intensive clustering algorithms, which are very hard to scale effectively to large datasets not fitting in the computer main memory. We propose an approach to extracting meaningful clusters from large databases by combining clustering and classification, which are driven by a human analyst through an interactive visual interface.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5332584/","LOCKED","5332584","Fraunhofer Institute IAIS (Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems), Sankt Augustin, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047100","1","Gennady Andrienko","37283047100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Fraunhofer Institute IAIS (Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems), Sankt Augustin, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047700","2","Natalia Andrienko","37283047700","KDD Lab ISTI CNR, Pisa, Italy","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37670571400","3","Salvatore Rinzivillo","37670571400","KDD Lab ISTI CNR, Pisa, Italy","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37669195900","4","Mirco Nanni","37669195900","University of Pisa, Italy","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37394413600","5","Dino Pedreschi","37394413600","KDD Lab ISTI CNR, Pisa, Italy","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268539100","6","Fosca Giannotti","37268539100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","111","2","12-13 Oct. 2009","Atlantic City, NJ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2009.5332584","10","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5332584/","Spatio-temporal data","movement data","trajectories","clustering","classification","scalable visualization","geovisualization","","","Humans","Clustering algorithms","Data visualization","Information analysis","Functional analysis","Information systems","Clustering methods","Scalability","Joining processes","Spatiotemporal phenomena","5332407","978-1-4244-5283-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-5283-5","09EX4063","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5332584","12-13 Oct. 2009","5312461","2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2009","IEEE","45","3","Interactive visual clustering of large collections of trajectories"
"This paper demonstrates the promise of augmenting interactive multivariate representations with information from statistical processes in the domain of weather data analysis. Statistical regression, correlation analysis, and descriptive statistical calculations are integrated via graphical indicators into an enhanced parallel coordinates system, called the Multidimensional Data eXplorer (MDX). These statistical indicators, which highlight significant associations in the data, are complemented with interactive visual analysis capabilities. The resulting system allows a smooth, interactive, and highly visual workflow. The system's utility is demonstrated with an extensive hurricane climate study that was conducted by a hurricane expert. In the study, the expert used a new data set of environmental weather data, composed of 28 independent variables, to predict annual hurricane activity. MDX shows the Atlantic Meridional Mode increases the explained variance of hurricane seasonal activity by 7-15% and removes less significant variables used in earlier studies. The findings and feedback from the expert (1) validate the utility of the data set for hurricane prediction, and (2) indicate that the integration of statistical processes with interactive parallel coordinates, as implemented in MDX, addresses both deficiencies in traditional weather data analysis and exhibits some of the expected benefits of visual data analysis.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5332586/","LOCKED","5332586","Naval Research Laboratory, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396434400","1","Chad A.

"A common task in literary analysis is to study characters in a novel or collection. Automatic entity extraction, text analysis and effective user interfaces facilitate character analysis. Using our interface, called POSvis, the scholar uses word clouds and self-organizing graphs to review vocabulary, to filter by part of speech, and to explore the network of characters located near characters under review. Further, visualizations show word usages within an analysis window (i.e. a book chapter), which can be compared with a reference window (i.e. the whole book).

"Discovering and extracting linear trends and correlations in datasets is very important for analysts to understand multivariate phenomena. However, current widely used multivariate visualization techniques, such as parallel coordinates and scatterplot matrices, fail to reveal and illustrate such linear relationships intuitively, especially when more than 3 variables are involved or multiple trends coexist in the dataset. We present a novel multivariate model parameter space visualization system that helps analysts discover single and multiple linear patterns and extract subsets of data that fit a model well. Using this system, analysts are able to explore and navigate in model parameter space, interactively select and tune patterns, and refine the model for accuracy using computational techniques. We build connections between model space and data space visually, allowing analysts to employ their domain knowledge during exploration to better interpret the patterns they discover and their validity. Case studies with real datasets are used to investigate the effectiveness of the visualizations.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333431/","LOCKED","5333431","Computer Science Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37668783300","1","Zhenyu Guo","37668783300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268441700","2","Matthew O.

"Visual exploration of multivariate data typically requires projection onto lower-dimensional representations. The number of possible representations grows rapidly with the number of dimensions, and manual exploration quickly becomes ineffective or even unfeasible. This paper proposes automatic analysis methods to extract potentially relevant visual structures from a set of candidate visualizations. Based on features, the visualizations are ranked in accordance with a specified user task. The user is provided with a manageable number of potentially useful candidate visualizations, which can be used as a starting point for interactive data analysis. This can effectively ease the task of finding truly useful visualizations and potentially speed up the data exploration task. In this paper, we present ranking measures for class-based as well as non class-based Scatterplots and Parallel Coordinates visualizations. The proposed analysis methods are evaluated on different datasets.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5332628/","LOCKED","5332628","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590724000","1","Andrada Tatu","37590724000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TU Braunschweig, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37603943800","2","Georgia Albuquerque","37603943800","TU Braunschweig, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546817000","3","Martin Eisemann","37546817000","Telefonica o2 Business, Intelligence Center, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37669961800","4","Jorn Schneidewind","37669961800","University of Magdeburg, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266875400","5","Holger Theisel","37266875400","TU Braunschweig, Germany","","6","Marcus Magnork","","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","7","Daniel Keim","37283138700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","80","1","12-13 Oct. 2009","Atlantic City, NJ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2009.5332628","66","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5332628/","H.3.3 [Information Storage and Retrieval]","Information Search and Retrieval I.3.3 [Computer Graphics]","Picture/Image Generation","","","","","","","Data visualization","Scattering","Visual analytics","Data mining","Coordinate measuring machines","Image storage","Information retrieval","Image retrieval","Displays","Business","5332407","978-1-4244-5283-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-5283-5","09EX4063","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5332628","12-13 Oct. 2009","5312461","2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2009","IEEE","49","59","Combining automated analysis and visualization techniques for effective exploration of high-dimensional data"
"Radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting-based techniques for localization are a promising approach for ubiquitous positioning systems, particularly indoors. By finding unique fingerprints of RF signals received at different locations within a predefined area beforehand, whenever a similar fingerprint is subsequently seen again, the localization system will be able to infer a user's current location. However, developers of these systems face the problem of finding reliable RF fingerprints that are unique enough and adequately stable over time. We present a visual analytics system that enables developers of these localization systems to visually gain insight on whether their collected datasets and chosen fingerprint features have the necessary properties to enable a reliable RF fingerprinting-based localization system. The system was evaluated by testing and debugging an existing localization system.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5332596/","LOCKED","5332596","School of Interactive Computing & GVU Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37677711000","1","Yi Han","37677711000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","School of Interactive Computing & GVU Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37670091600","2","Erich P.

"Sources of streaming information, such as news syndicates, publish information continuously. Information portals and news aggregators list the latest information from around the world enabling information consumers to easily identify events in the past 24 hours. The volume and velocity of these streams causes information from prior days to quickly vanish despite its utility in providing an informative context for interpreting new information. Few capabilities exist to support an individual attempting to identify or understand trends and changes from streaming information over time. The burden of retaining prior information and integrating with the new is left to the skills, determination, and discipline of each individual. In this paper we present a visual analytics system for linking essential content from information streams over time into dynamic stories that develop and change over multiple days. We describe particular challenges to the analysis of streaming information and present a fundamental visual representation for showing story change and evolution over time.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333437/","LOCKED","5333437","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37434158300","1","Stuart Rose","37434158300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38179762500","2","Scott Butner","38179762500","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37672002300","3","Wendy Cowley","37672002300","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37285562300","4","Michelle Gregory","37285562300","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37671797700","5","Julia Walker","37671797700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","16","0","12-13 Oct. 2009","Atlantic City, NJ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2009.5333437","106","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333437/","H.3.1 [Content Analysis and Indexing]: Abstracting methods—","H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: Information Filtering—","H.3.7 [Digital Libraries]: User Issues—","I.3.3 [Computer Graphics]: Picture/Image Generation—","","","","","","Information analysis","Graphics","Visual analytics","Joining processes","Streaming media","Data models","Laboratories","Portals","Image analysis","Indexing","5332407","978-1-4244-5283-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-5283-5","09EX4063","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333437","12-13 Oct. 2009","5312461","2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2009","IEEE","51","99","Describing story evolution from dynamic information streams"
"Do court cases differ from place to place? What kind of picture do we get by looking at a country's collection of law cases? We introduce parallel tag clouds: a new way to visualize differences amongst facets of very large metadata-rich text corpora. We have pointed parallel tag clouds at a collection of over 600,000 US Circuit Court decisions spanning a period of 50 years and have discovered regional as well as linguistic differences between courts. The visualization technique combines graphical elements from parallel coordinates and traditional tag clouds to provide rich overviews of a document collection while acting as an entry point for exploration of individual texts. We augment basic parallel tag clouds with a details-in-context display and an option to visualize changes over a second facet of the data, such as time. We also address text mining challenges such as selecting the best words to visualize, and how to do so in reasonable time periods to maintain interactivity.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333443/","LOCKED","5333443","University of Toronto, Canada","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37669874100","1","Christopher Collins","37669874100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IBM Research, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681355300","2","Fernanda B.

"Visual analytics has become an important tool for gaining insight on large and complex collections of data. Numerous statistical tools and data transformations, such as projections, binning and clustering, have been coupled with visualization to help analysts understand data better and faster. However, data is inherently uncertain, due to error, noise or unreliable sources. When making decisions based on uncertain data, it is important to quantify and present to the analyst both the aggregated uncertainty of the results and the impact of the sources of that uncertainty. In this paper, we present a new framework to support uncertainty in the visual analytics process, through statistic methods such as uncertainty modeling, propagation and aggregation. We show that data transformations, such as regression, principal component analysis and k-means clustering, can be adapted to account for uncertainty. This framework leads to better visualizations that improve the decision-making process and help analysts gain insight on the analytic process itself.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5332611/","LOCKED","5332611","University of California at Davis, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282925900","1","Carlos D.

"During visual analysis, users must often connect insights discovered at various points of time. This process is often called ldquoconnecting the dots.rdquo When analysts interactively explore complex datasets over multiple sessions, they may uncover a large number of findings. As a result, it is often difficult for them to recall the past insights, views and concepts that are most relevant to their current line of inquiry. This challenge is even more difficult during collaborative analysis tasks where they need to find connections between their own discoveries and insights found by others. In this paper, we describe a context-based retrieval algorithm to identify notes, views and concepts from users' past analyses that are most relevant to a view or a note based on their line of inquiry. We then describe a related notes recommendation feature that surfaces the most relevant items to the user as they work based on this algorithm.

"Gene mapping is a statistical method used to localize human disease genes to particular regions of the human genome. When performing such analysis, a genetic likelihood space is generated and sampled, which results in a multidimensional scalar field. Researchers are interested in exploring this likelihood space through the use of visualization. Previous efforts at visualizing this space, though, were slow and cumbersome, only showing a small portion of the space at a time, thus requiring the user to keep a mental picture of several views. We have developed a new technique that displays much more data at once by projecting the multidimensional data into several 2D plots. One plot is created for each parameter that shows the change along that parameter. A radial projection is used to create another plot that provides an overview of the high dimensional surface from the perspective of a single point. Linking and brushing between all the plots are used to determine relationships between parameters. We demonstrate our techniques on real world autism data, showing how to visually examine features of the high dimensional space.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333917/","LOCKED","5333917","Battelle Center for Mathematical Medicine, Nationwide Childrens Hospital & The Ohio State University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37570501300","1","Boonthanome Nouanesengsy","37570501300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Battelle Center for Mathematical Medicine, Nationwide Childrens Hospital, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37667195400","2","Sang-Cheol Seok","37667195400","The Ohio State University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279493500","3","Han-Wei Shen","37279493500","Battelle Center for Mathematical Medicine, Nationwide Childrens Hospital & The Ohio State University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681642300","4","Veronica J Vieland","37681642300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2","0","12-13 Oct. 2009","Atlantic City, NJ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2009.5333917","178","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333917/","Visualization","Multidimensional data","Linkage Analysis","Posterior Probability of Linkage","PPL","PPLD","LD analysis","Linkage disequilibrium","Autism","Genetics","Humans","Multidimensional systems","Space exploration","Data visualization","Statistical analysis","Diseases","Genomics","Bioinformatics","Performance analysis","5332407","978-1-4244-5283-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-5283-5","09EX4063","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5333917","12-13 Oct. 2009","5312461","2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2009","IEEE","56","171","Using projection and 2D plots to visually reveal genetic mechanisms of complex human disorders"
"Today, online stores collect a lot of customer feedback in the form of surveys, reviews, and comments. This feedback is categorized and in some cases responded to, but in general it is underutilized - even though customer satisfaction is essential to the success of their business. In this paper, we introduce several new techniques to interactively analyze customer comments and ratings to determine the positive and negative opinions expressed by the customers. First, we introduce a new discrimination-based technique to automatically extract the terms that are the subject of the positive or negative opinion (such as price or customer service) and that are frequently commented on. Second, we derive a Reverse-Distance-Weighting method to map the attributes to the related positive and negative opinions in the text. Third, the resulting high-dimensional feature vectors are visualized in a new summary representation that provides a quick overview. We also cluster the reviews according to the similarity of the comments. Special thumbnails are used to provide insight into the composition of the clusters and their relationship. In addition, an interactive circular correlation map is provided to allow analysts to detect the relationships of the comments to other important attributes and the scores. We have applied these techniques to customer comments from real-world online stores and product reviews from web sites to identify the strength and problems of different products and services, and show the potential of our technique.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5333919/","LOCKED","5333919","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591207400","1","Daniela Oelke","37591207400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hewlett Packard Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37069334200","2","Ming Hao","37069334200","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601356700","3","Christian Rohrdantz","37601356700","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","4","Daniel A.

"Interactive visualization could become an essential tool in the work of investigative analysts. Visualization could help analysts to explore large collections of data and documents, supporting the analysts investigative sense-making processes. This panel gathers recognized leaders from three important domains, investigative reporting, biosciences (genomics), and intelligence analysis, that all include a fundamental investigative analysis component. The panelists will provide a glimpse into their worlds, describing and illustrating the data they examine, the goals and methods of their analysts, and the culture of their respective professions. In particular, the panelists will explore how visualization could potentially benefit investigators from their domain and they will provide guidance for visualization researchers seeking to collaborate with their colleagues.","","EPHEMERA","5332411","Georgia Tech, (Panel Organizer), USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267736900","1","John Stasko","37267736900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Duke University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37670643100","2","Sarah Cohen","37670643100","Univ. of Colorado School of Medicine, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38226790100","3","Lawrence Hunter","38226790100","i2 Limited, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37672224300","4","Joe Parry","37672224300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","12-13 Oct. 2009","Atlantic City, NJ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2009.5332411","281","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5332411/","investigative analysis","interactive visualization","visual analytics","investigative reporting","genomics","intelligence analysis","","","","Data visualization","Visual analytics","Genomics","Bioinformatics","Information analysis","Software systems","Military computing","Text analysis","Collaboration","Information systems","5332407","978-1-4244-5283-5","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-5283-5","09EX4063","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5332411","12-13 Oct. 2009","5312461","2009 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2009","IEEE","72","279","How interactive visualization can assist investigative analysis: Views and perspectives from domain experts"
