"Research on information visualization has reached the point where a number of successful point designs have been proposed and a variety of techniques have been discovered. It is now appropriate to describe and analyze portions of the design space so as to understand the differences among designs and to suggest new possibilities.

"We present the H3 layout technique for drawing large directed graphs as node-link diagrams in 3D hyperbolic space. We can lay out much larger structures than can be handled using traditional techniques for drawing general graphs because we assume a hierarchical nature of the data. We impose a hierarchy on the graph by using domain-specific knowledge to find an appropriate spanning tree. Links which are not part of the spanning tree do not influence the layout but can be selectively drawn by user request. The volume of hyperbolic 3-space increases exponentially, as opposed to the familiar geometric increase of euclidean 3-space. We exploit this exponential amount of room by computing the layout according to the hyperbolic metric. We optimize the cone tree layout algorithm for 3D hyperbolic space by placing children on a hemisphere around the cone mouth instead of on its perimeter. Hyperbolic navigation affords a Focus+Context view of the structure with minimal visual clutter. We have successfully laid out hierarchies of over 20,000 nodes. Our implementation accommodates navigation through graphs too large to be rendered interactively by allowing the user to explicitly prune or expand subtrees.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/636718/","LOCKED","636718","University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA","University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349490300","1","T.

"The display of multivariate datasets in parallel coordinates, transforms the search for relations among the variables into a 2-D pattern recognition problem. This is the basis for the application to visual data mining. The knowledge discovery process together with some general guidelines are illustrated on a dataset from the production of a VLSI chip. The special strength of parallel coordinates is in modeling relations. As an example, a simplified economic model is constructed with data from various economic sectors of a real country. The visual model shows the interelationship and dependencies between the sectors, circumstances where there is competition for the same resource, and feasible economic policies. Interactively, the model can be used to do trade-off analyses, discover sensitivities, do approximate optimization, monitor (as in a process) and provide decision support.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/636793/","LOCKED","636793","Computer Science Department, San Diego SuperComputing Center, Tel-Aviv University, Israel","Computer Science Department, San Diego SuperComputing Center, Tel-Aviv University, Israel","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294162600","1","A.

"We introduce nonlinear magnification fields as an abstract representation of nonlinear magnification, providing methods for converting transformation routines to magnification fields and vice-versa. This new representation provides ease of manipulation and power of expression. By removing the restrictions of explicit foci and allowing precise specification of magnification values, we can achieve magnification effects which were not previously possible. Of particular interest are techniques we introduce for expressing complex and subtle magnification effects through magnification brushing, and allowing intrinsic properties of the data being visualized to create data-driven magnifications.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/636786/","LOCKED","636786","Indiana University Bloomington, Bloomington, IN, US","Indiana University Bloomington, Bloomington, IN, US","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349418300","1","T.A.

"In information visualization, as the volume and complexity of the data increases, researchers require more powerful visualization tools that enable them to more effectively explore multidimensional datasets. We discuss the general utility of a novel visualization spreadsheet framework. Just as a numerical spreadsheet enables exploration of numbers, a visualization spreadsheet enables exploration of visual forms of information. We show that the spreadsheet approach facilitates certain information visualization tasks that are more difficult using other approaches. Unlike traditional spreadsheets, which store only simple data elements and formulas in each cell, a visualization spreadsheet cell can hold an entire complex data set, selection criteria, viewing specifications, and other information needed for a full-fledged information visualization. Similarly, inter-cell operations are far more complex, stretching beyond simple arithmetic and string operations to encompass a range of domain-specific operators. We have built two prototype systems that illustrate some of these research issues. The underlying approach in our work allows domain experts to define new data types and data operations, and enables visualization experts to incorporate new visualizations, viewing parameters, and view operations.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/636761/","LOCKED","636761","Department of Computer Science, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA","Department of Computer Science, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087757864","1","E.H.-H.

"A method for efficiently volume rendering dense scatterplots of relational data is described. Plotting difficulties that arise from large numbers of data points, categorical variables, interaction with non-axis dimensions, and unknown values, are addressed by this method. The domain of the plot is voxelized using binning and then volume rendering. Since a table is used as the underlying data structure, no storage is wasted on regions with no data. The opacity of each voxel is a function of the number of data points in a corresponding bin. A voxel's color is derived by averaging the value of one of the variables for all the data points that fall in a bin. Other variables in the data may be mapped to external query sliders. A dragger object permits a user to select regions inside the volume.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/636791/","LOCKED","636791","Silicon Graphics, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA","Silicon Graphics, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37363099200","1","B.G.

"The Table Lens, focus+context visualization for large data tables, allows users to see 100 times as many data values as a spreadsheet in the same screen space in a manner that enables an extremely immediate form of exploratory data analysis. In the original Table Lens design, data are shown in the context area using graphical representations in a single pixel row. Scaling up the Table Lens technique beyond approximately 500 cases (rows) by 40 variables (columns) requires not showing every value individually and thus raises challenges for preserving the exploratory and navigational ease and power of the original design. We describe two design enhancements for introducing regions of less than a pixel row for each data value and discuss the issues raised by each.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/636787/","LOCKED","636787","Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, Inxight Software, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA","Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, Inxight Software, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087952577","1","T.

"We describe a system that allows the user to rapidly construct program visualizations over a variety of data sources. Such a system is a necessary foundation for using visualization as an aid to software understanding. The system supports an arbitrary set of data sources so that information from both static and dynamic analysis can be combined to offer meaningful software visualizations. It provides the user with a visual universal-relation front end that supports the definition of queries over multiple data sources without knowledge of the structure or contents of the sources. It uses a flexible back end with a range of different visualizations, most geared to the efficient display of large amounts of data. The result is a high-quality, easy-to-define program visualization that can address specific problems and hence is useful for software understanding. The overall system is flexible and extensible in that both the underlying data model and the set of visualizations are defined in resource files.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/636785/","LOCKED","636785","Department of Computer Science, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA","Department of Computer Science, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37269712400","1","S.P.

According to the given viewpoint, the RF-Cone adaptively organizes the 3D representation of the hypermedia so that we can understand the semantic and structural relationship of the hypermedia and easily retrieve the information.

"This paper describes the SHriMP visualization technique for seamlessly exploring software structure and browsing source code, with a focus on effectively assisting hybrid program comprehension strategies. The technique integrates both pan+zoom and fisheye-view visualization approaches for exploring a nested graph view of software structure. The fisheye-view approach handles multiple focal points, which are necessary when examining several subsystems and their mutual interconnections. Source code is presented by embedding code fragments within the nodes of the nested graph. Finer connections among these fragments are represented by a network that is navigated using a hypertext link-following metaphor. SHriMP combines this hypertext metaphor with animated panning and zooming motions over the nested graph to provide continuous orientation and contextual cues for the user. The SHriMP tool is being evaluated in several user studies. Observations of users performing program understanding tasks with the tool are discussed.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/636784/","LOCKED","636784","Department of Computer Science, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada","Department of Computer Science, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada","School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268043300","1","M.-A.D.

"The Bead visualization system employs a fast algorithm for laying out high-dimensional data in a low-dimensional space, and a number of features added to 3D visualizations to improve imageability. We describe recent work on both aspects of the system, in particular a generalization of the data types laid out and the implementation of imageability features in a 2D visualization tool. The variety of data analyzed in a financial institution such as UBS, and the ubiquity of spreadsheets as a medium for analysis, led us to extend our layout tools to handle data in a generic spreadsheet format. We describe the metrics of similarity used for this data type, and give examples of layouts of sets of records of financial trades. Conservatism and scepticism with regard to 3D visualization, along with the lack of functionality of widely available 3D web browsers, led to the development of a 2D visualization tool with refinements of a number of our imageability features.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/636789/","LOCKED","636789","UbiLaboratory, Union Bank of Switzerland, Zurich, Switzerland","UbiLaboratory, Union Bank of Switzerland, Zurich, Switzerland","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37611663700","1","D.

"We describe a method for the visualization of information units on spherical domains which is employed in the banking industry for risk analysis, stock prediction and other tasks. The system is based on a quantification of the similarity of related objects that governs the parameters of a mass-spring system. Unlike existing approaches we initialize all information units onto the inner surface of two concentric spheres and attach them with springs to the outer sphere. Since the spring stiffnesses correspond to the computed similarity measures, the system converges into an energy minimum which reveals multidimensional relations and adjacencies in terms of spatial neighborhoods. Depending on the application scenario our approach supports different topological arrangements of related objects. In order to cope with large data sets we propose a blobby clustering mechanism that enables encapsulation of similar objects by implicit shapes. In addition, we implemented various interaction techniques allowing semantic analysis of the underlying data sets. Our prototype system IVORY is written in Java, and its versatility is illustrated by an example from financial service providers.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/636759/","LOCKED","636759","Department of Computer Science, Federal Institute of Technology (ETH), Zurich, Switzerland","Department of Computer Science, Federal Institute of Technology (ETH), Zurich, Switzerland","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275694700","1","M.H.

"Interactive visualization techniques allow data exploration to be a continuous process, rather than a discrete sequence of queries and results as in traditional database systems. However limitations in expressive power of current visualization systems force users to go outside the system and form a new dataset in order to perform certain operations, such as those involving the relationship among multiple objects. Further, there is no support for integrating data from the new dataset into previous visualizations, so users must recreate them. Visage's information centric paradigm provides an architectural hook for linking data across multiple queries, removing this overhead. This paper describes the addition to Visage of a visual query language, called VQE, which allows users to express more complicated queries than in previous interactive visualization systems. Visualizations can be created from queries and vice versa. When either is updated, the other changes to maintain consistency.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/636788/","LOCKED","636788","Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute, USA","Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37444609500","1","M.
