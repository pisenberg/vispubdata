"The mini-challenge 2 of VAST Challenge 2019 asks the participants to make sense of the radiation conditions in St. Himark using radiation readings from the both stationary monitors and mobile sensors, particularly, to detect and monitor a bunch of contaminated cars running in the city. This paper presents our visual analysis solution to detect and localize these cars using various visualization techniques, including small multiples, distribution histogram, and animation. As a result, we detected most of these cars, characterize their behavior during the given time period and give suspected locations of these cars at the end. We also developed a visual analysis interface using Tableau to help users evaluate the uncertainty of sensor readings, make sense of radiation changes in different area, and make future plans to deploy more sensors.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986910/","LOCKED","8986910","Hangzhou Chengying Data Technology Co., Ltd.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087500091","1","Yueqi Hu","37087500091","Hangzhou Chengying Data Technology Co., Ltd.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087501892","2","Qi Ma","37087501892","Hangzhou Chengying Data Technology Co., Ltd.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087502906","3","Yang Chen","37087502906","Hangzhou Chengying Data Technology Co., Ltd.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087499049","4","Haidong Chen","37087499049","Hangzhou Chengying Data Technology Co., Ltd.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087501729","5","Weiqing Jin","37087501729","Hangzhou Chengying Data Technology Co., Ltd.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087501208","6","Fenjin Ye","37087501208","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","20-25 Oct. 2019","Vancouver, BC, Canada","Conferences","10.1109/VAST47406.2019.8986910","119","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986910/","Visual analytics","Small Multiple","","Time Series Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8986897","978-1-7281-2285-4","Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","New-2005","978-1-7281-2285-4","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-7281-2284-7","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8986910","20-25 Oct. 2019","8966971","2019 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2019","IEEE","2","118","Visual Analysis of Multivariate Time Series of Static and Mobile Sensors"

"This paper introduces EQSA, an interactive exploratory tool for earthquake situational analytics using social media. EQSA is designed to support users to characterize the condition across the area around the earthquake zone, regarding related events, resources to be allocated, and responses from the community. On the general level, changes in the volume of messages from chosen categories are presented, assisting users in conveying a general idea of the condition. More in-depth analysis is provided with topic evolution, community visualization, and location representation. EQSA is developed with intuitive, interactive features and multiple linked views, visualizing social media data, and supporting users to gain a comprehensive insight into the situation. In this paper, we present the application of EQSA with the VAST Challenge 2019: Mini-Challenge 3 (MC3) dataset.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986947/","LOCKED","8986947","Texas Tech University,Department of Computer Science","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087500456","1","Huyen N.

"The effective analysis of data collected by mobile sensors and static sensors deployed in cities is a great challenge, due to the spatiotemporal characteristics and uncertainty. To meet the challenge of VAST 2019 Mini-Challenge 2, SUA, an interactive visual analysis tool with a novel uncertainty glyph is designed. The tool provides a clear understanding of conditions in the city by visualizing the trajectories, the measurements, as well as the uncertainty of the sensors, and supports an overview-to-detail visual reasoning process.

"The goal of the VAST challenge 2019 Mini Challenge 2 was to visualize radioactive contaminations measured by mobile and static sensors and their changes over time, allowing city officials to determine the severity of the leakage at the city's nuclear power plant. We propose cpmViz, a web-based tool that allows for interactive data exploration of the sensor readings in both of the spatial and temporal dimensions. The tool consists out of three views that are connected via linking and scrolling. We visualize static sensor uncertainty by introducing Voronoi cells to illustrate how much space is covered by an individual measurement unit. For mobile sensors, we showcase their activity periods and introduce the concept of sensor streaks as periods of uninterrupted recordings as a temporal uncertainty measure. As for spatial uncertainty, we color individual districts based on the amount of data that was recorded inside the user's selected time window. Using our system, we were able to easily spot major events like the city's initial earthquake in the sensor readings.

"In this paper, we develop a visual analysis method for interactively improving the quality of labeled data, which is essential to the success of supervised and semi-supervised learning. The quality improvement is achieved through the use of user-selected trusted items. We employ a bi-level optimization model to accurately match the labels of the trusted items and to minimize the training loss. Based on this model, a scalable data correction algorithm is developed to handle tens of thousands of labeled data efficiently. The selection of the trusted items is facilitated by an incremental tSNE with improved computational efficiency and layout stability to ensure a smooth transition between different levels. We evaluated our method on real-world datasets through quantitative evaluation and case studies, and the results were generally favorable.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986943/","LOCKED","8986943","School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087500773","1","Shouxing Xiang","37087500773","School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087499275","2","Xi Ye","37087499275","School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087498581","3","Jiazhi Xia","37087498581","School of Computer Science and Informatics, Cardiff University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087502305","4","Jing Wu","37087502305","School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087502906","5","Yang Chen","37087502906","School of Software, BNRist, Tsinghua University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406039100","6","Shixia Liu","37406039100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4","0","20-25 Oct. 2019","Vancouver, BC, Canada","Conferences","10.1109/VAST47406.2019.8986943","68","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986943/","Labeled data debugging","trusted item","","tSNE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8986897","978-1-7281-2285-4","Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","New-2005","978-1-7281-2285-4","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-7281-2284-7","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8986943","20-25 Oct. 2019","8966971","2019 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2019","IEEE","24","57","Interactive Correction of Mislabeled Training Data"
"Natural language can be a useful modality for creating and interacting with visualizations but users often have unrealistic expectations about the intelligence of natural language systems. The gulf between user expectations and system capabilities may lead to a disappointing user experience. So - if we want to engineer a natural language system, what are the requirements around system intelligence? This work takes a retrospective look at how we answered this question in the design of Ask Data, a natural language interaction feature for Tableau. We examine two factors contributing to perceived system intelligence: the system's ability to understand the analytic intent behind an input utterance and the ability to interpret an utterance contextually (i.e. taking into account the current visualization state and recent actions). Our aim was to understand the ways in which a system would need to support these two aspects of intelligence to enable a positive user experience. We first describe a pre-design Wizard of Oz study that offered insight into this question and narrowed the space of designs under consideration. We then reflect on the impact of this study on system development, examining how design implications from the study played out in practice. Our work contributes insights for the design of natural language interaction in visual analytics as well as a reflection on the value of pre-design empirical studies in the development of visual analytic systems.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986918/","LOCKED","8986918","Tableau Software,Palo Alto,California,USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275861300","1","Melanie Tory","37275861300","Tableau Software,Palo Alto,California,USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37392286200","2","Vidya Setlur","37392286200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3","0","20-25 Oct. 2019","Vancouver, BC, Canada","Conferences","10.1109/VAST47406.2019.8986918","103","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986918/","Visualization","Empirical studies in visualization","","Human-centered computing","Interaction paradigms","Natural language interfaces","","","","","","","","","","","","","8986897","978-1-7281-2285-4","Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","New-2005","978-1-7281-2285-4","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-7281-2284-7","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8986918","20-25 Oct. 2019","8966971","2019 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2019","IEEE","25","93","Do What I Mean, Not What I Say!

"Topic modeling is commonly used to analyze and understand large document collections. However, in practice, users want to focus on specific aspects or “targets” rather than the entire corpus. For example, given a large collection of documents, users may want only a smaller subset which more closely aligns with their interests, tasks, and domains. In particular, our paper focuses on large-scale document retrieval with high recall where any missed relevant documents can be critical. A simple keyword matching search is generally not effective nor efficient as 1) it is difficult to find a list of keyword queries that can cover the documents of interest before exploring the dataset, 2) some documents may not contain the exact keywords of interest but may still be highly relevant, and 3) some words have multiple meanings, which would result in irrelevant documents included in the retrieved subset. In this paper, we present TopicSifter, a visual analytics system for interactive search space reduction. Our system utilizes targeted topic modeling based on nonnegative matrix factorization and allows users to give relevance feedback in order to refine their target and guide the topic modeling to the most relevant results.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986922/","LOCKED","8986922","Georgia Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085351744","1","Hannah Kim","37085351744","Georgia Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087498654","2","Dongjin Choi","37087498654","Georgia Tech Research Institute","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37845636600","3","Barry Drake","37845636600","Georgia Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681759500","4","Alex Endert","37681759500","Georgia Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38581281700","5","Haesun Park","38581281700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","20-25 Oct. 2019","Vancouver, BC, Canada","Conferences","10.1109/VAST47406.2019.8986922","45","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986922/","Human-centered computing","Visualization","","Visualization application domains","Visual analytics","Information systems","Information retrieval","Users and interactive retrieval","Search interfaces","","","Computational modeling","Buildings","Visual analytics","Search problems","Negative feedback","","","8986897","978-1-7281-2285-4","Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","New-2005","978-1-7281-2285-4","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-7281-2284-7","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8986922","20-25 Oct. 2019","8966971","2019 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2019","IEEE","26","35","TopicSifter: Interactive Search Space Reduction through Targeted Topic Modeling"
"We present the Influence Flower, a new visual metaphor for the influence profile of academic entities, including people, projects, institutions, conferences, and journals. While many tools quantify influence, we aim to expose the flow of influence between entities. The Influence Flower is an ego-centric graph, with a query entity placed in the centre. The petals are styled to reflect the strength of influence to and from other entities of the same or different type. For example, one can break down the incoming and outgoing influences of a research lab by research topics. The Influence Flower uses a recent snapshot of Microsoft Academic Graph, consisting of 212 million authors, their 176 million publications, and 1.2 billion citations. An interactive web app, Influence Map, is constructed around this central metaphor for searching and curating visualisations. We also propose a visual comparison method that highlights change in influence patterns over time. We demonstrate through several case studies that the Influence Flower supports data-driven inquiries about the following: researchers' careers over time; paper(s) and projects, including those with delayed recognition; the interdisciplinary profile of a research institution; and the shifting topical trends in conferences. We also use this tool on influence data beyond academic citations, by contrasting the academic and Twitter activities of a researcher.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986934/","LOCKED","8986934","Australian National University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087501230","1","Minjeong Shin","37087501230","Australian National University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087499975","2","Alexander Soen","37087499975","Australian National University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087498684","3","Benjamin T.

"The detection of interesting patterns in large high-dimensional datasets is difficult because of their dimensionality and pattern complexity. Therefore, analysts require automated support for the extraction of relevant patterns. In this paper, we present FDive, a visual active learning system that helps to create visually explorable relevance models, assisted by learning a pattern-based similarity. We use a small set of user-provided labels to rank similarity measures, consisting of feature descriptor and distance function combinations, by their ability to distinguish relevant from irrelevant data. Based on the best-ranked similarity measure, the system calculates an interactive Self-Organizing Map-based relevance model, which classifies data according to the cluster affiliation. It also automatically prompts further relevance feedback to improve its accuracy. Uncertain areas, especially near the decision boundaries, are highlighted and can be refined by the user. We evaluate our approach by comparison to state-of-the-art feature selection techniques and demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by a case study classifying electron microscopy images of brain cells. The results show that FDive enhances both the quality and understanding of relevance models and can thus lead to new insights for brain research.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986940/","LOCKED","8986940","University of Konstanz,Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087126923","1","Frederik L.

"Networks are a natural way of thinking about many datasets. The data on which a network is based, however, is rarely collected in a form that suits the analysis process, making it necessary to create and reshape networks. Data wrangling is widely acknowledged to be a critical part of the data analysis pipeline, yet interactive network wrangling has received little attention in the visualization research community. In this paper, we discuss a set of operations that are important for wrangling network datasets and introduce a visual data wrangling tool, Origraph, that enables analysts to apply these operations to their datasets. Key operations include creating a network from source data such as tables, reshaping a network by introducing new node or edge classes, filtering nodes or edges, and deriving new node or edge attributes. Our tool, Origraph, enables analysts to execute these operations with little to no programming, and to immediately visualize the results. Origraph provides views to investigate the network model, a sample of the network, and node and edge attributes. In addition, we introduce interfaces designed to aid analysts in specifying arguments for sensible network wrangling operations. We demonstrate the usefulness of Origraph in two Use Cases: first, we investigate gender bias in the film industry, and then the influence of money on the political support for the war in Yemen.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986909/","LOCKED","8986909","University of Utah","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085905494","1","Alex Bigelow","37085905494","University of Utah","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399400500","2","Carolina Nobre","37399400500","University of Utah","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564728700","3","Miriah Meyer","37564728700","University of Utah","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37395933400","4","Alexander Lex","37395933400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2","0","20-25 Oct. 2019","Vancouver, BC, Canada","Conferences","10.1109/VAST47406.2019.8986909","92","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986909/","Graph visualization","Data abstraction","","Data wrangling","Human-centered computing [Information visualization]","[Human-centered computing]: Visualization systems and tools","Information systems [Graph-based database models]","","","","","","","","","","","","8986897","978-1-7281-2285-4","Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","New-2005","978-1-7281-2285-4","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-7281-2284-7","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8986909","20-25 Oct. 2019","8966971","2019 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2019","IEEE","29","81","Origraph: Interactive Network Wrangling"
"The growing capability and accessibility of machine learning has led to its application to many real-world domains and data about people. Despite the benefits algorithmic systems may bring, models can reflect, inject, or exacerbate implicit and explicit societal biases into their outputs, disadvantaging certain demographic subgroups. Discovering which biases a machine learning model has introduced is a great challenge, due to the numerous definitions of fairness and the large number of potentially impacted subgroups. We present FAIRVIS, a mixed-initiative visual analytics system that integrates a novel subgroup discovery technique for users to audit the fairness of machine learning models. Through FAIRVIS, users can apply domain knowledge to generate and investigate known subgroups, and explore suggested and similar subgroups. FAIRVIS's coordinated views enable users to explore a high-level overview of subgroup performance and subsequently drill down into detailed investigation of specific subgroups. We show how FAIRVIS helps to discover biases in two real datasets used in predicting income and recidivism. As a visual analytics system devoted to discovering bias in machine learning, FAIRVIS demonstrates how interactive visualization may help data scientists and the general public understand and create more equitable algorithmic systems.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986948/","LOCKED","8986948","Georgia Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087500188","1","Ángel Alexander Cabrera","37087500188","Georgia Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087499812","2","Will Epperson","37087499812","Georgia Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086235240","3","Fred Hohman","37086235240","Georgia Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085451248","4","Minsuk Kahng","37085451248","Georgia Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087502546","5","Jamie Morgenstern","37087502546","Georgia Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087499514","6","Duen Horng Chau","37087499514","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4","0","20-25 Oct. 2019","Vancouver, BC, Canada","Conferences","10.1109/VAST47406.2019.8986948","56","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986948/","Machine learning fairness","visual analytics","","intersectional bias","subgroup discovery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8986897","978-1-7281-2285-4","Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","New-2005","978-1-7281-2285-4","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-7281-2284-7","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8986948","20-25 Oct. 2019","8966971","2019 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2019","IEEE","30","46","FAIRVIS: Visual Analytics for Discovering Intersectional Bias in Machine Learning"
"Argumentation Mining addresses the challenging tasks of identifying boundaries of argumentative text fragments and extracting their relationships. Fully automated solutions do not reach satisfactory accuracy due to their insufficient incorporation of semantics and domain knowledge. Therefore, experts currently rely on time-consuming manual annotations. In this paper, we present a visual analytics system that augments the manual annotation process by automatically suggesting which text fragments to annotate next. The accuracy of those suggestions is improved over time by incorporating linguistic knowledge and language modeling to learn a measure of argument similarity from user interactions. Based on a long-term collaboration with domain experts, we identify and model five high-level analysis tasks. We enable close reading and note-taking, annotation of arguments, argument reconstruction, extraction of argument relations, and exploration of argument graphs. To avoid context switches, we transition between all views through seamless morphing, visually anchoring all text- and graph-based layers. We evaluate our system with a two-stage expert user study based on a corpus of presidential debates. The results show that experts prefer our system over existing solutions due to the speedup provided by the automatic suggestions and the tight integration between text and graph views.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986917/","LOCKED","8986917","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086245203","1","Fabian Sperrle","37086245203","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086240969","2","Rita Sevastjanova","37086240969","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087101535","3","Rebecca Kehlbeck","37087101535","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086235941","4","Mennatallah El-Assady","37086235941","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","20-25 Oct. 2019","Vancouver, BC, Canada","Conferences","10.1109/VAST47406.2019.8986917","22","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986917/","Argumentation annotation","machine learning","","user interaction","layered interfaces","semantic transitions","","","","","","","","","","","","","8986897","978-1-7281-2285-4","Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","New-2005","978-1-7281-2285-4","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-7281-2284-7","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8986917","20-25 Oct. 2019","8966971","2019 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2019","IEEE","31","11","VIANA: Visual Interactive Annotation of Argumentation"
"There are many applications where users seek to explore the impact of the settings of several categorical variables with respect to one dependent numerical variable. For example, a computer systems analyst might want to study how the type of file system or storage device affects system performance. A usual choice is the method of Parallel Sets designed to visualize multivariate categorical variables, However, we found that the magnitude of the parameter impacts on the numerical variable cannot be easily observed here. We also attempted a dimension reduction approach based on Multiple Correspondence Analysis but found that the SVD-generated 2D layout resulted in a loss of information. We hence propose a novel approach, the Interactive Configuration Explorer (ICE), which directly addresses the need of analysts to learn how the dependent numerical variable is affected by the parameter settings given multiple optimization objectives. No information is lost as ICE shows the complete distribution and statistics of the dependent variable in context with each categorical variable. Analysts can interactively filter the variables to optimize for certain goals such as achieving a system with maximum performance, low variance, etc. Our system was developed in tight collaboration with a group of systems performance researchers and its final effectiveness was evaluated with expert interviews, a comparative user study, and two case studies.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986923/","LOCKED","8986923","Stony Brook University,Department of Computer Science","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087502080","1","Anjul Tyagi","37087502080","Stony Brook University,Department of Computer Science","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087501577","2","Zhen Cao","37087501577","Stony Brook University,Department of Computer Science","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087499598","3","Tyler Estro","37087499598","Stony Brook University,Department of Computer Science","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37421767600","4","Erez Zadok","37421767600","Stony Brook University,Department of Computer Science","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273119700","5","Klaus Mueller","37273119700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","20-25 Oct. 2019","Vancouver, BC, Canada","Conferences","10.1109/VAST47406.2019.8986923","34","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986923/","Data Clustering","Illustrative Visualization","","User Interfaces","High Dimensional Data","","","","","","","Data visualization","Ice","System performance","Throughput","Correlation","Visualization","Optimization","8986897","978-1-7281-2285-4","Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","New-2005","978-1-7281-2285-4","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-7281-2284-7","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8986923","20-25 Oct. 2019","8966971","2019 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2019","IEEE","32","23","ICE: An Interactive Configuration Explorer for High Dimensional Categorical Parameter Spaces"

"Summary form only given. In the information age, the ability to read and make data visualizations is as important as the ability to read and write. This talk introduces a theoretical data visualization framework (DVL) meant to empower anyone to systematically render data into insights using temporal, geospatial, topical, and network analyses and visualizations. Exemplarily, the DVL is applied to (1) Map science and technology, see interactive data visualizations from the Places & Spaces: Mapping Science exhibit (http://scimaps.org) and recent PNAS special issue on Modelling and Visualizing Science and Technology Developments (https://www.pnas.org/modeling). (2) Design reference systems and user interfaces within the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) (https://commonfund.nih.gov/hubmap) that support the exploration and communication of single-cell data-from the subcellular to the whole body level. (3) Teach Visual Analytics (https://visanalytics.cns.iu.edu) to students around the globe.","","EPHEMERA","8986914","Indiana University","","1","Katy Börner","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","20-25 Oct. 2019","Vancouver, BC, Canada","Conferences","10.1109/VAST47406.2019.8986914","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8986897","978-1-7281-2285-4","Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","New-2005","978-1-7281-2285-4","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-7281-2284-7","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8986914","20-25 Oct. 2019","8966971","2019 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2019","IEEE","39","1","VIS Keynote Address: Data Visualization Literacy"
"The charts, graphs, network diagrams, and other graphics generally grouped under the rubric “information visualizations” were almost all developed to serve the empirical, statistical, or social sciences. They use explicit quantities, standard metrics, and unambiguous visual elements to create clear, concise, legible messages. The terms on which visualizations are assessed tends to value these properties-and to be premised on the idea that the best graphics are those that “show the data”-as if data had inherent form. The difficulty with this entire set of assumptions is that they do not establish foundations for visualizing complex historical events, narrative discourse, or human experience as it is expressed in documents and artifacts where “data” are not self-evident or standard. The humanities, in adopting visualizations from empirically based fields, has failed to develop methods that engage with the interpretative aspects of its own discourse. Using three case studies-one from news narratives, one from mixed historical chronologies, one from imagined crisis scenarios-this paper argues for the development of visualizations capable of showing variable timescales, comparative chronology, and partial and unfolding temporalities. The basic components of these systems are non-linear, affective, and unable to be standardized in ways that trouble empirical approaches but serve interpretative understandings of experience and its representation in cultural expressions. The questions of how such systems might be designed and where they might have useful applications will be raised to generate discussion.","","EPHEMERA","8986953","UCLA","","1","Johanna Drucker","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","20-25 Oct. 2019","Vancouver, BC, Canada","Conferences","10.1109/VAST47406.2019.8986953","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8986897","978-1-7281-2285-4","Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","New-2005","978-1-7281-2285-4","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-7281-2284-7","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8986953","20-25 Oct. 2019","8966971","2019 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2019","IEEE","40","1","VIS Capstone Address: Visualizing Temporality and Chronologies for the Humanities"
