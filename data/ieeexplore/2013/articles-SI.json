Tiled display walls offer a large workspace that can be navigated physically by the user. Based on head tracking information, the physical characteristics of the tiled display and the formulation of visual acuity, we guide an out-of-core gigapixel rendering scheme by delivering high levels of detail only in places where it is perceivable to the user. We apply this principle to gigapixel image rendering through adaptive level of detail selection. Additionally, we have developed an acuity-driven tessellation scheme for high-quality Focus-and-Context (F+C) lenses that significantly reduces visual artifacts while accurately capturing the underlying lens function. We demonstrate this framework on the Reality Deck, an immersive gigapixel display. We present the results of a user study designed to quantify the impact of our acuity-driven rendering optimizations in the visual exploration process. We discovered no evidence suggesting a difference in search task performance between our framework and naive rendering of gigapixel resolution data, while realizing significant benefits in terms of data transfer overhead. Additionally, we show that our acuity-driven tessellation scheme offers substantially increased frame rates when compared to naive pre-tessellation, while providing indistinguishable image quality.","article_number":"6634175","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634175","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634175/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2886","end_page":"2895","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":1,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Lenses","Rendering (computer graphics)","Pixels","Data visualization","Image resolution","Context awareness"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Lenses","Rendering (computer graphics)","Pixels","Data visualization","Image resolution","Context awareness","gigapixel display","Gigapixel visualization","visual acuity","focus and context","Reality Deck"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.122","title":"A Model for Structure-Based Comparison of Many Categories in Small-Multiple Displays","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":2,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center, Vienna, and the Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, Vienna University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546620000","id":37546620000,"full_name":"Johannes Kehrer","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center, Vienna","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282562500","id":37282562500,"full_name":"Harald Piringer","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center, Vienna","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546977900","id":37546977900,"full_name":"Wolfgang Berger","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, Vienna University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282552200","id":37282552200,"full_name":"M.

In this paper, we present a formal model for defining semantically meaningful comparisons between many categories in a small-multiple display. Based on pivotized data that are hierarchically partitioned by the categories assigned to the x and y axis of the display, we propose two alternatives for structure-based comparison within this hierarchy. With an absolute reference specification, categories are compared to a fixed reference category. With a relative reference specification, in contrast, a semantic ordering of the categories is considered when comparing them either to the previous or subsequent category each. Both reference specifications can be defined at multiple levels of the hierarchy (including aggregated summaries), enabling a multitude of useful comparisons. We demonstrate the general applicability of our model in several application examples using different visualizations that compare data by overlay or explicit encoding of differences.","article_number":"6634111","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634111","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634111/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2287","end_page":"2296","citing_paper_count":21,"citing_patent_count":1,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Encoding","Data visualization","Displays","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Encoding","Data visualization","Displays","Computational modeling","categorical data","Comparative visualization","small-multiple displays","trellis displays"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.173","title":"LineUp: Visual Analysis of Multi-Attribute Rankings","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":3,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Johannes Kepler University Linz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077342300","id":37077342300,"full_name":"Samuel Gratzl","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Johannes Kepler University Linz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37395933400","id":37395933400,"full_name":"Alexander Lex","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Harvard University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37972937500","id":37972937500,"full_name":"Nils Gehlenborg","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Harvard University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275698100","id":37275698100,"full_name":"Hanspeter Pfister","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"Harvard Medical School","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403918900","id":37403918900,"full_name":"Marc Streit","author_order":5}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Rankings are a popular and universal approach to structuring otherwise unorganized collections of items by computing a rank for each item based on the value of one or more of its attributes. This allows us, for example, to prioritize tasks or to evaluate the performance of products relative to each other. While the visualization of a ranking itself is straightforward, its interpretation is not, because the rank of an item represents only a summary of a potentially complicated relationship between its attributes and those of the other items. It is also common that alternative rankings exist which need to be compared and analyzed to gain insight into how multiple heterogeneous attributes affect the rankings. Advanced visual exploration tools are needed to make this process efficient. In this paper we present a comprehensive analysis of requirements for the visualization of multi-attribute rankings. Based on these considerations, we propose LineUp - a novel and scalable visualization technique that uses bar charts. This interactive technique supports the ranking of items based on multiple heterogeneous attributes with different scales and semantics. It enables users to interactively combine attributes and flexibly refine parameters to explore the effect of changes in the attribute combination. This process can be employed to derive actionable insights as to which attributes of an item need to be modified in order for its rank to change. Additionally, through integration of slope graphs, LineUp can also be used to compare multiple alternative rankings on the same set of items, for example, over time or across different attribute combinations. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-attribute visualization technique in a qualitative study. The study shows that users are able to successfully solve complex ranking tasks in a short period of time.","article_number":"6634146","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634146","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634146/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2277","end_page":"2286","citing_paper_count":107,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Rankings","Data visualization","Encoding","Histograms","Scalability"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Rankings","Data visualization","Encoding","Histograms","Scalability","stacked bar charts","Ranking visualization","ranking","scoring","multi-attribute","multifactorial","multi-faceted"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.129","title":"Ambient Volume Scattering","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":4,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"VISUS, University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37393968500","id":37393968500,"full_name":"Marco Ament","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"VISUS, University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282541900","id":37282541900,"full_name":"Filip Sadlo","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"VISUS, University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268045000","id":37268045000,"full_name":"Daniel Weiskopf","author_order":3}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present ambient scattering as a preintegration method for scattering on mesoscopic scales in direct volume rendering. Far-range scattering effects usually provide negligible contributions to a given location due to the exponential attenuation with increasing distance. This motivates our approach to preintegrating multiple scattering within a finite spherical region around any given sample point. To this end, we solve the full light transport with a Monte-Carlo simulation within a set of spherical regions, where each region may have different material parameters regarding anisotropy and extinction. This precomputation is independent of the data set and the transfer function, and results in a small preintegration table. During rendering, the look-up table is accessed for each ray sample point with respect to the viewing direction, phase function, and material properties in the spherical neighborhood of the sample. Our rendering technique is efficient and versatile because it readily fits in existing ray marching algorithms and can be combined with local illumination and volumetric ambient occlusion. It provides interactive volumetric scattering and soft shadows, with interactive control of the transfer function, anisotropy parameter of the phase function, lighting conditions, and viewpoint. A GPU implementation demonstrates the benefits of ambient scattering for the visualization of different types of data sets, with respect to spatial perception, high-quality illumination, translucency, and rendering speed.","article_number":"6634150","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634150","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634150/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2936","end_page":"2945","citing_paper_count":20,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Scattering","Lighting","Rendering (computer graphics)","Computational modeling","Transfer functions","Solid modeling","Light sources"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Scattering","Lighting","Rendering (computer graphics)","Computational modeling","Transfer functions","Solid modeling","Light sources","gradient-free shading","Direct volume rendering","volume illumination","ambient scattering","preintegrated light transport"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.131","title":"An Exploration Framework to Identify and Track Movement of Cloud Systems","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":5,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Polytechnic Institute of New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38228713200","id":38228713200,"full_name":"Harish Doraiswamy","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Indian Institute of Science","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37278509300","id":37278509300,"full_name":"Vijay Natarajan","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Indian Institute of Science","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37372536400","id":37372536400,"full_name":"Ravi S.

Using techniques from computational topology and computer vision, our framework allows the user to study this movement at various scales in space and time. Such movements could have large temporal and spatial scales such as the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO), which has a spatial scale ranging from 1000 km to 10000 km and time of oscillation of around 40 days. Embedded within these larger scale oscillations are a hierarchy of cloud clusters which could have smaller spatial and temporal scales such as the Nakazawa cloud clusters. These smaller cloud clusters, while being part of the equatorial MJO, sometimes move at speeds different from the larger scale and in a direction opposite to that of the MJO envelope. Hitherto, one could only speculate about such movements by selectively analysing data and a priori knowledge of such systems. Our framework automatically delineates such cloud clusters and does not depend on the prior experience of the user to define cloud clusters. Analysis using our framework also shows that most tropical systems such as cyclones also contain multi-scale interactions between clouds and cloud systems.

Translating user interactions into algorithmic input is a key component of Visual to Parametric Interaction (V2PI) [13]. Instead of adjusting parameters, users directly move data points on the screen, which then updates the underlying statistical model. However, we have found that some data points that are not moved by the user are just as important in the interactions as the data points that are moved. Users frequently move some data points with respect to some other 'unmoved' data points that they consider as spatially contextual. However, in current V2PI interactions, these points are not explicitly identified when directly manipulating the moved points. We design a richer set of interactions that makes this context more explicit, and a new algorithm and sophisticated weighting scheme that incorporates the importance of these unmoved data points into V2PI.","article_number":"6634115","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634115","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634115/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2052","end_page":"2059","citing_paper_count":23,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Cognitive science","Mathematical model","Algorithm design and analysis","Semantics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Cognitive science","Mathematical model","Algorithm design and analysis","Semantics","statistical models","Visual to parametric interaction","visual analytics"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.220","title":"Visual Analysis of Higher-Order Conjunctive Relationships in Multidimensional Data Using a Hypergraph Query System","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":8,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Akashic Labs LLC","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077394700","id":37077394700,"full_name":"Rachel Shadoan","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and the Center for Spatial Analysis at University of Oklahoma","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564883300","id":37564883300,"full_name":"Chris Weaver","author_order":2}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Visual exploration and analysis of multidimensional data becomes increasingly difficult with increasing dimensionality.

This paper provides a detailed analysis of the expressive power of existing visual querying systems and describes a more flexible approach in which users can explore n-ary conjunctive inter- and intra- dimensional relationships by interactively constructing queries as visual hypergraphs. In a hypergraph query, nodes represent subsets of values and hyperedges represent conjunctive relationships. Analysts can dynamically build and modify the query using sequences of simple interactions. The hypergraph serves not only as a query specification, but also as a compact visual representation of the interactive state.

In this paper, we present a lighting design method for volume visualization employing global illumination. The resulting system takes into account view and transfer-function dependent content of the volume data to automatically generate an optimized three-point lighting environment. Our method fully exploits the back light which is not used by previous volume visualization systems. By also including global shadow and multiple scattering, our lighting system can effectively enhance the depth and shape perception of volumetric features of interest.

Our strategy employs a Bayesian framework to first construct a statistical aggregate from the ensemble.

Through this approach, modelers are able to better assess the predictive strengths and weaknesses of the ensemble as a whole, as well as individual models.

While being useful for simple vector fields, the MCG can be hard to comprehend for topologically rich vector fields, containing a large number of features. This paper describes a visual representation of the MCG, inspired by previous work on graph visualization. Our approach aims to preserve the spatial relationships between the MCG arcs and nodes and highlight the coherent behavior of connecting trajectories. Using simulations of ocean flow, we show that it can provide useful information on the flow structure. This paper focuses specifically on MCGs computed for piecewise constant (PC) vector fields. In particular, we describe extensions of the PC framework that make it more flexible and better suited for analysis of data on complex shaped domains with a boundary. We also describe a topology simplification scheme that makes our MCG visualizations less ambiguous. Despite the focus on the PC framework, our approach could also be applied to graph representations or topological skeletons computed using different methods.","article_number":"6634162","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634162","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634162/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2763","end_page":"2772","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Trajectory","Computer graphics","Topology","Corporate acquisitions","Two dimensional displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Trajectory","Computer graphics","Topology","Corporate acquisitions","Two dimensional displays","Morse connection graph","Vector field topology"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.196","title":"StoryFlow: Tracking the Evolution of Stories","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":13,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406039100","id":37406039100,"full_name":"Shixia Liu","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","id":37407308300,"full_name":"Yingcai Wu","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077071700","id":37077071700,"full_name":"Enxun Wei","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Tsinghua University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077049000","id":37077049000,"full_name":"Mengchen Liu","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077995700","id":37077995700,"full_name":"Yang Liu","author_order":5}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Storyline visualizations, which are useful in many applications, aim to illustrate the dynamic relationships between entities in a story.

We propose to restrict star coordinates to orthographic projections which map an nD sphere of radius r to a 2D circle of radius r. We achieve this by formulating conditions for the coordinate axes to define orthographic projections, and by running a repeated non-linear optimization in the background of every modification of the coordinate axes. This way, we define a number of orthographic interaction concepts as well as orthographic data tour sequences: a scatterplot tour, a principle component tour, and a grand tour.

Deriving robust statistics and visualizing the variability of an ensemble is a challenging task and is usually accomplished through direct visualization of ensemble members or by providing aggregate representations such as an average or pointwise probabilities. In many cases, the interesting quantities in a simulation are not dense fields, but are sets of features that are often represented as thresholds on physical or derived quantities. In this paper, we introduce a generalization of boxplots, called contour boxplots, for visualization and exploration of ensembles of contours or level sets of functions. Conventional boxplots have been widely used as an exploratory or communicative tool for data analysis, and they typically show the median, mean, confidence intervals, and outliers of a population. The proposed contour boxplots are a generalization of functional boxplots, which build on the notion of data depth. Data depth approximates the extent to which a particular sample is centrally located within its density function. This produces a center-outward ordering that gives rise to the statistical quantities that are essential to boxplots. Here we present a generalization of functional data depth to contours and demonstrate methods for displaying the resulting boxplots for two-dimensional simulation data in weather forecasting and computational fluid dynamics.","article_number":"6634129","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634129","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634129/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2713","end_page":"2722","citing_paper_count":102,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Shape analysis","Uncertainty","Computational modeling","Weather forecasting","Numerical models","Statistical analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Shape analysis","Uncertainty","Computational modeling","Weather forecasting","Numerical models","Statistical analysis","order statistics","Uncertainty visualization","Boxplots","band depth","ensemble visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.128","title":"Adaptive Refinement of the Flow Map Using Sparse Samples","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":16,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38328697800","id":38328697800,"full_name":"Samer S.

The flow map describes the transport of massless particles along the flow. As such, it is a fundamental concept in the analysis of transient flow phenomena and all so-called Lagrangian flow visualization techniques require its approximation. The flow map is generally obtained by integrating a dense 1D, 2D, or 3D set of particles across the domain of definition of the flow. Despite its embarrassingly parallel nature, this computation creates a performance bottleneck in the analysis of large-scale datasets that existing adaptive techniques alleviate only partially. Our iterative approximation method significantly improves upon the state of the art by precisely modeling the flow behavior around automatically detected geometric structures embedded in the flow, thus effectively restricting the sampling effort to interesting regions. Our data reconstruction is based on a modified version of Sibson's scattered data interpolation and allows us at each step to offer an intermediate dense approximation of the flow map and to seamlessly integrate regions that will be further refined in subsequent steps. We present a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of our method on different types of flow datasets and offer a detailed comparison with existing techniques.","article_number":"6634133","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634133","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634133/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2753","end_page":"2762","citing_paper_count":16,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Interpolation","Image edge detection","Surface reconstruction","Least squares approximations","Trajectory","Approximation error"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Interpolation","Image edge detection","Surface reconstruction","Least squares approximations","Trajectory","Approximation error","parallel reconstruction","Lagrangian flow visualization","flow map","edge features","scattered data interpolation","sparse sampling","adaptive refinement"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.215","title":"Vessel Visualization using Curved Surface Reformation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":17,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Vienna University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233357100","id":38233357100,"full_name":"Thomas Auzinger","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Vienna University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233231400","id":38233231400,"full_name":"Gabriel Mistelbauer","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Kaiser-Franz-Josef Hospital Vienna","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077614100","id":37077614100,"full_name":"Ivan Baclija","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Medical University of Vienna","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233231200","id":38233231200,"full_name":"R√ºdiger Schernthaner","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"Landesklinikum Tulln","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282581900","id":37282581900,"full_name":"Arnold K√∂chl","author_order":5},{"affiliation":"Vienna University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38191309900","id":38191309900,"full_name":"Michael Wimmer","author_order":6},{"affiliation":"Vienna University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282552200","id":37282552200,"full_name":"M.

Curved Planar Reformation (CPR) is a wide-spread method that is designed for peripheral arteries which exhibit one dominant direction. To analyze the lumen of arbitrarily oriented vessels, Centerline Reformation (CR) has been proposed. Both methods project the vascular structures into 2D image space in order to reconstruct the vessel lumen. In this paper, we propose Curved Surface Reformation (CSR), a technique that computes the vessel lumen fully in 3D. This offers high-quality interactive visualizations of vessel lumina and does not suffer from problems of earlier methods such as ambiguous visibility cues or premature discretization of centerline data.

Our technique uses frequency-based representations to enable quickly finding and analyzing different kinds of overlaps between the sets, and relating these overlaps to other attributes of the table entities. Furthermore, it enables various interactions to select elements of interest, find out if they are over-represented in specific sets or overlaps, and if they exhibit a different distribution for a specific attribute compared to the rest of the elements. These interactions allow formulating highly-expressive visual queries on the elements in terms of their set memberships and attribute values.

They allow users to detect correlations and clusters in the data. Whether or not a user can accomplish these tasks highly depends on the aspect ratio selected for the plot, i.e., the ratio between the horizontal and the vertical extent of the diagram. We argue that an aspect ratio is good if the Delaunay triangulation of the scatter plot at this aspect ratio has some nice geometric property, e.g., a large minimum angle or a small total edge length. More precisely, we consider the following optimization problem. Given a set Q of points in the plane, find a scale factor s such that scaling the x-coordinates of the points in Q by s and the y-coordinates by 1=s yields a point set P(s) that optimizes a property of the Delaunay triangulation of P(s), over all choices of s. We present an algorithm that solves this problem efficiently and demonstrate its usefulness on real-world instances.

We redistribute the opacity within a voxel to improve the readability of the color defined by a regular transfer function, and to maintain the see-through capabilities of volume rendering. We use predictable procedural noise - random-phase Gabor noise - to generate a high-frequency redistribution pattern and construct an opacity mapping function, which allows to partition the available space among the displayed data attributes. This mapping function is appropriately filtered to avoid aliasing, while maintaining transparent regions. We show the usefulness of our approach on various data sets and with different example applications. Furthermore, we evaluate our method by comparing it to other visualization techniques in a controlled user study. Overall, the results of our study indicate that users are much more accurate in determining exact data values with our novel 3D volume visualization method.

Alternatively, computer graphics and virtual reality camera motion planning is frequently focused on collision free movement in a virtual walkthrough. For semi-transparent, fuzzy, or blobby volume data the collision free objective becomes insufficient. Here, we provide a set of essential criteria focused on computing camera paths to establish effective animations of volume data. Our dynamic multi-criteria solver coupled with a force-directed routing algorithm enables rapid generation of camera paths. Once users review the resulting animation and evaluate the camera motion, they are able to determine how each criterion impacts path generation.

This provides for an immersive and direct data generation activity, and furthermore it also enables users to interactively edit and clean existing high-dimensional data from possible artifacts. SketchPadND offers two visualization paradigms, one based on parallel coordinates and the other based on a relatively new framework using an N-D polygon to navigate in high-dimensional space. The first interface allows users to draw arbitrary profiles of probability density functions along each dimension axis and sketch shapes for data density and connections between adjacent dimensions. The second interface embraces the idea of sculpting. Users can carve data at arbitrary orientations and refine them wherever necessary. This guarantees that the data generated is truly high-dimensional.

Visualization plays a key role in conveying important properties in ensembles, such as the degree to which members of the ensemble agree or disagree in their behavior. For ensembles of time-varying vector fields, there are numerous challenges for providing an expressive comparative visualization, among which is the requirement to relate the effect of individual flow divergence to joint transport characteristics of the ensemble. Yet, techniques developed for scalar ensembles are of little use in this context, as the notion of transport induced by a vector field cannot be modeled using such tools. We develop a Lagrangian framework for the comparison of flow fields in an ensemble. Our techniques evaluate individual and joint transport variance and introduce a classification space that facilitates incorporation of these properties into a common ensemble visualization. Variances of Lagrangian neighborhoods are computed using pathline integration and Principal Components Analysis.

The action shots provide a still view of the moving object while the path view presents movement properties such as speed and location. We also provide tools for spatial and temporal filtering based on regions of interest. This allows analysts to filter out large amounts of movement activities while the action shot representation summarizes the content of each movement.

Fourteen different tasks were designed and a total of 120 min of surveillance video were recorded (indoor and outdoor locations recording movements of people and vehicles). The time-to-completion of these tasks were compared against a manual fast forward video browsing guided with movement detection.

The state-of-theart molecular representation is the SES model, which provides a detailed surface visualization. Nevertheless, it is computationally expensive, so the less accurate Gaussian model is traditionally preferred. We introduce a novel surface representation that resembles the SES and approaches the rendering performance of the Gaussian model. Our technique is based on the iterative blending of implicit functions and avoids any pre-computation. Additionally, we propose a GPU-based ray-casting algorithm that efficiently visualize our molecular representation.

However, there is a lack of effective techniques for comparative visualization and assessment of a collection of motion data due to its 4-dimensional nature, i.e., timely varying three-dimensional shapes. From the geometric point of view, the motion change can be considered as a function defined on the 2D manifold of the surface. This paper presents a novel classification and visualization method based on a medial surface shape space, in which two novel shape descriptors are defined, for discriminating normal and abnormal human heart deformations as well as localizing the abnormal motion regions. In our medial surface shape space, the geodesic distance connecting two points in the space measures the similarity between their corresponding medial surfaces, which can quantify the similarity and disparity of the 3D heart motions. Furthermore, the novel descriptors can effectively localize the inconsistently deforming myopathic regions on the left ventricle. An easy visualization of heart motion sequences on the projected space allows users to distinguish the deformation differences. Our experimental results on both synthetic and real imaging data show that this method can automatically classify the healthy and myopathic subjects and accurately detect myopathic regions on the left ventricle, which outperforms other conventional cardiac diagnostic methods.","article_number":"6634092","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634092","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634092/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2644","end_page":"2652","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Shape analysis","Cardiology","Heart","Biomedical monitoring","Atomic measurements","Data visualization","Level measurement"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Shape analysis","Cardiology","Heart","Biomedical monitoring","Atomic measurements","Data visualization","Level measurement","left ventricle diagnosis","Medial surface","shape space","comparative visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.152","title":"Efficient Local Statistical Analysis via Integral Histograms with Discrete Wavelet Transform","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":31,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"The Ohio State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403060100","id":37403060100,"full_name":"Teng-Yok Lee","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"The Ohio State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279493500","id":37279493500,"full_name":"Han-Wei Shen","author_order":2}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Histograms computed from local regions are commonly used in many visualization applications, and allowing the user to query histograms interactively in regions of arbitrary locations and sizes plays an important role in feature identification and tracking. Computing histograms in regions with arbitrary location and size, nevertheless, can be time consuming for large data sets since it involves expensive I/O and scan of data elements. To achieve both performance- and storage-efficient query of local histograms, we present a new algorithm called WaveletSAT, which utilizes integral histograms, an extension of the summed area tables (SAT), and discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Similar to SAT, an integral histogram is the histogram computed from the area between each grid point and the grid origin, which can be be pre-computed to support fast query. Nevertheless, because one histogram contains multiple bins, it will be very expensive to store one integral histogram at each grid point. To reduce the storage cost for large integral histograms, WaveletSAT treats the integral histograms of all grid points as multiple SATs, each of which can be converted into a sparse representation via DWT, allowing the reconstruction of axis-aligned region histograms of arbitrary sizes from a limited number of wavelet coefficients. Besides, we present an efficient wavelet transform algorithm for SATs that can operate on each grid point separately in logarithmic time complexity, which can be extended to parallel GPU-based implementation. With theoretical and empirical demonstration, we show that WaveletSAT can achieve fast preprocessing and smaller storage overhead than the conventional integral histogram approach with close query performance.","article_number":"6634159","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634159","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634159/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2693","end_page":"2702","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Histograms","Discrete wavelet transforms","Statistical analysis","Time complexity","Integral equations"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Histograms","Discrete wavelet transforms","Statistical analysis","Time complexity","Integral equations","discrete wavelet transform","WaveletSAT","integral histograms"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.153","title":"Empirical Guidance on Scatterplot and Dimension Reduction Technique Choices","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":32,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Vienna","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590945600","id":37590945600,"full_name":"Michael Sedlmair","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"University of British Columbia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349490300","id":37349490300,"full_name":"Tamara Munzner","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"University of Victoria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275861300","id":37275861300,"full_name":"Melanie Tory","author_order":3}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"To verify cluster separation in high-dimensional data, analysts often reduce the data with a dimension reduction (DR) technique, and then visualize it with 2D Scatterplots, interactive 3D Scatterplots, or Scatterplot Matrices (SPLOMs).

Each coder scored all color-coded classes in each scatterplot in terms of their separability from other classes. We analyze the resulting quantitative data with a heatmap approach, and qualitatively discuss interesting scatterplot examples. Our findings reveal that 2D scatterplots are often 'good enough', that is, neither SPLOM nor interactive 3D adds notably more cluster separability with the chosen DR technique. If 2D is not good enough, the most promising approach is to use an alternative DR technique in 2D. Beyond that, SPLOM occasionally adds additional value, and interactive 3D rarely helps but often hurts in terms of poorer class separation and usability. We summarize these results as a workflow model and implications for design.

Each visualization was annotated with additional attributes, including ratings for data-ink ratios and visual densities. Using Amazon's Mechanical Turk, we collected memorability scores for hundreds of these visualizations, and discovered that observers are consistent in which visualizations they find memorable and forgettable. We find intuitive results (e.g., attributes like color and the inclusion of a human recognizable object enhance memorability) and less intuitive results (e.g., common graphs are less memorable than unique visualization types). Altogether our findings suggest that quantifying memorability is a general metric of the utility of information, an essential step towards determining how to design effective visualizations.","article_number":"6634103","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634103","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634103/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634103/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2306","end_page":"2315","citing_paper_count":171,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Taxonomy","Information technology","Encoding"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Taxonomy","Information technology","Encoding","memorability","Visualization taxonomy","information visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.147","title":"Design by Dragging: An Interface for Creative Forward and Inverse Design with Simulation Ensembles","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":36,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38327390600","id":38327390600,"full_name":"Dane Coffey","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077270900","id":37077270900,"full_name":"Chi-Lun Lin","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295449100","id":37295449100,"full_name":"Arthur G.

These meshes represent the shape and the internal density distribution of a particular anatomical structure and are derived from statistical shape and intensity models (SSIMs). We apply our method to improve the geometric reconstruction of 3D anatomy (e.g. pelvic bone) from 2D X-ray images. For that purpose, shape and density of a tetrahedral mesh are varied and virtual X-ray projections are generated within an optimization process until the similarity between the computed virtual X-ray and the respective anatomy depicted in a given clinical X-ray is maximized. The OpenGL implementation presented in this work deforms and projects tetrahedral meshes of high resolution (200.000+ tetrahedra) at interactive rates. It generates virtual X-rays that accurately depict the density distribution of an anatomy of interest. Compared to existing methods that accumulate X-ray attenuation in deformable meshes, our novel approach significantly boosts the deformation/projection performance. The proposed projection algorithm scales better with respect to mesh resolution and complexity of the density distribution, and the combined deformation and projection on the GPU scales better with respect to the number of deformation parameters. The gain in performance allows for a larger number of cycles in the optimization process. Consequently, it reduces the risk of being stuck in a local optimum. We believe that our approach will improve treatments in orthopedics, where 3D anatomical information is essential.","article_number":"6634177","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634177","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634177/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634177/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2673","end_page":"2682","citing_paper_count":31,"citing_patent_count":1,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["X-ray imaging","Deformable models","Shape analysis","Image reconstruction","Three-dimensional displays","Graphics processing units","Attenuation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["X-ray imaging","Deformable models","Shape analysis","Image reconstruction","Three-dimensional displays","Graphics processing units","Attenuation","GPU acceleration","Digitally reconstructed radiographs","volume rendering","mesh deformation","statistical shape and intensity models","image registration"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.130","title":"An Empirically-Derived Taxonomy of Interaction Primitives for Interactive Cartography and Geovisualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":38,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Wisconsin-Madison","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489149900","id":38489149900,"full_name":"Robert E.

A semi-structured interview study first was conducted with 21 expert interactive map users to understand the way in which map-based visualizations currently are employed. The interviews were transcribed and coded to identify statements representative of either the task the user wished to accomplish (i.e., objective primitives) or the interactive functionality included in the visualization to achieve this task (i.e., operator primitives). A card sorting study then was conducted with 15 expert interactive map designers to organize these example statements into logical structures based on their experience translating client requests into interaction designs. Example statements were supplemented with primitive definitions in the literature and were separated into two sorting exercises: objectives and operators. The objective sort suggested five objectives that increase in cognitive sophistication (identify, compare, rank, associate, & delineate), but exhibited a large amount of variation across participants due to consideration of broader user goals (procure, predict, & prescribe) and interaction operands (space-alone, attributes-in-space, & space-in-time; elementary & general). The operator sort suggested five enabling operators (import, export, save, edit, & annotate) and twelve work operators (reexpress, arrange, sequence, resymbolize, overlay, pan, zoom, reproject, search, filter, retrieve, & calculate).

However, no general tool can incorporate the latest capabilities for all possible applications, nor can the user interfaces and workflows be easily adjusted to accommodate all user communities. As a result, users will often chose either substandard solutions presented in familiar, customized tools or assemble a patchwork of individual applications glued through ad-hoc scripts and extensive, manual intervention. Instead, we need the ability to easily and rapidly assemble the best-in-task tools into custom interfaces and workflows to optimally serve any given application community. Unfortunately, creating such meta-applications at the API or SDK level is difficult, time consuming, and often infeasible due to the sheer variety of data models, design philosophies, limits in functionality, and the use of closed commercial systems. In this paper, we present the ManyVis framework which enables custom solutions to be built both rapidly and simply by allowing coordination and communication across existing unrelated applications. ManyVis allows users to combine software tools with complementary characteristics into one virtual application driven by a single, custom-designed interface.","article_number":"6634144","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634144","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634144/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634144/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2878","end_page":"2885","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Shape analysis","Graphical user interfaces","Data visualization","Image color analysis","Programming"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Shape analysis","Graphical user interfaces","Data visualization","Image color analysis","Programming","linked views","Visualization environments","integrated applications","macros"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.232","title":"Visualizing Fuzzy Overlapping Communities in Networks","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":40,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"VISUS, University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017348600","id":38017348600,"full_name":"Corinna Vehlow","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077289100","id":37077289100,"full_name":"Thomas Reinhardt","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"VISUS, University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268045000","id":37268045000,"full_name":"Daniel Weiskopf","author_order":3}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"An important feature of networks for many application domains is their community structure. This is because objects within the same community usually have at least one property in common. The investigation of community structure can therefore support the understanding of object attributes from the network topology alone. In real-world systems, objects may belong to several communities at the same time, i.e., communities can overlap. Analyzing fuzzy community memberships is essential to understand to what extent objects contribute to different communities and whether some communities are highly interconnected. We developed a visualization approach that is based on node-link diagrams and supports the investigation of fuzzy communities in weighted undirected graphs at different levels of detail. Starting with the network of communities, the user can continuously drill down to the network of individual nodes and finally analyze the membership distribution of nodes of interest. Our approach uses layout strategies and further visual mappings to graphically encode the fuzzy community memberships. The usefulness of our approach is illustrated by two case studies analyzing networks of different domains: social networking and biological interactions. The case studies showed that our layout and visualization approach helps investigate fuzzy overlapping communities. Fuzzy vertices as well as the different communities to which they belong can be easily identified based on node color and position.","article_number":"6634179","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634179","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634179/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634179/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2486","end_page":"2495","citing_paper_count":27,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Communities","Layout","Fuzzy methods","Uncertainty","Image color analysis","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Communities","Layout","Fuzzy methods","Uncertainty","Image color analysis","Data visualization","uncertainty visualization","Overlapping community visualization","fuzzy clustering","graph visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.213","title":"VAICo: Visual Analysis for Image Comparison","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":41,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Vienna University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077239600","id":37077239600,"full_name":"Johanna Schmidt","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Vienna University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282552200","id":37282552200,"full_name":"M.

In many situations it is necessary to compare two or more datasets. Hence there is a need for comparative visualization tools to help analyze differences or similarities among datasets. In this paper an approach for comparative visualization for sets of images is presented. Well-established techniques for comparing images frequently place them side-by-side. A major drawback of such approaches is that they do not scale well. Other image comparison methods encode differences in images by abstract parameters like color. In this case information about the underlying image data gets lost. This paper introduces a new method for visualizing differences and similarities in large sets of images which preserves contextual information, but also allows the detailed analysis of subtle variations. Our approach identifies local changes and applies cluster analysis techniques to embed them in a hierarchy. The results of this process are then presented in an interactive web application which allows users to rapidly explore the space of differences and drill-down on particular features. We demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by applying it to multiple distinct domains.","article_number":"6634107","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634107","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634107/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634107/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2090","end_page":"2099","citing_paper_count":29,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Image color analysis","Visual analytics","Shape analysis","Image segmentation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Image color analysis","Visual analytics","Shape analysis","Image segmentation","image set comparison","Comparative visualization","focus+context visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.191","title":"SketchStory: Telling More Engaging Stories with Data through Freeform Sketching","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":42,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37293389400","id":37293389400,"full_name":"Bongshin Lee","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"National University of Singapore","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077893700","id":37077893700,"full_name":"Rubaiat Habib Kazi","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37960251500","id":37960251500,"full_name":"Greg Smith","author_order":3}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Presenting and communicating insights to an audience-telling a story-is one of the main goals of data exploration. Even though visualization as a storytelling medium has recently begun to gain attention, storytelling is still underexplored in information visualization and little research has been done to help people tell their stories with data. To create a new, more engaging form of storytelling with data, we leverage and extend the narrative storytelling attributes of whiteboard animation with pen and touch interactions. We present SketchStory, a data-enabled digital whiteboard that facilitates the creation of personalized and expressive data charts quickly and easily. SketchStory recognizes a small set of sketch gestures for chart invocation, and automatically completes charts by synthesizing the visuals from the presenter-provided example icon and binding them to the underlying data. Furthermore, SketchStory allows the presenter to move and resize the completed data charts with touch, and filter the underlying data to facilitate interactive exploration. We conducted a controlled experiment for both audiences and presenters to compare SketchStory with a traditional presentation system, Microsoft PowerPoint. Results show that the audience is more engaged by presentations done with SketchStory than PowerPoint. Eighteen out of 24 audience participants preferred SketchStory to PowerPoint. Four out of five presenter participants also favored SketchStory despite the extra effort required for presentation.","article_number":"6634113","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634113","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634113/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634113/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2416","end_page":"2425","citing_paper_count":41,"citing_patent_count":1,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Animation","Real-time systems","Rendering (computer graphics)","Filtering"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Animation","Real-time systems","Rendering (computer graphics)","Filtering","visualization","Storytelling","data presentation","sketch","pen and touch","interaction"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.227","title":"Visual Sedimentation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":43,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"INRIA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077910700","id":37077910700,"full_name":"Samuel Huron","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"INRIA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681739300","id":37681739300,"full_name":"Romain Vuillemot","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"INRIA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407972900","id":37407972900,"full_name":"Jean-Daniel Fekete","author_order":3}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We introduce Visual Sedimentation, a novel design metaphor for visualizing data streams directly inspired by the physical process of sedimentation.

For data streams, clearly expressing chronological order while avoiding clutter, and keeping aging data visible, are important. The metaphor is drawn from the real-world sedimentation processes: objects fall due to gravity, and aggregate into strata over time. Inspired by this metaphor, data is visually depicted as falling objects using a force model to land on a surface, aggregating into strata over time. In this paper, we discuss how this metaphor addresses the specific challenge of smoothing the transition between incoming and aging data. We describe the metaphor's design space, a toolkit developed to facilitate its implementation, and example applications to a range of case studies. We then explore the generative capabilities of the design space through our toolkit.

We take advantage of the fact that, for many types of data, independent crowd workers can readily perform basic analysis tasks like examining views and generating explanations for trends and patterns. However, workers operating in parallel can often generate redundant explanations. Moreover, because workers have different competencies and domain knowledge, some responses are likely to be more plausible than others. To efficiently utilize the crowd's work, analysts must be able to quickly identify and consolidate redundant responses and determine which explanations are the most plausible. In this paper, we demonstrate several crowd-assisted techniques to help analysts make better use of crowdsourced explanations: (1) We explore crowd-assisted strategies that utilize multiple workers to detect redundant explanations. We introduce color clustering with representative selection-a strategy in which multiple workers cluster explanations and we automatically select the most-representative result-and show that it generates clusterings that are as good as those produced by experts. (2) We capture explanation provenance by introducing highlighting tasks and capturing workers' browsing behavior via an embedded web browser, and refine that provenance information via source-review tasks. We expose this information in an explanation-management interface that allows analysts to interactively filter and sort responses, select the most plausible explanations, and decide which to explore further.","article_number":"6634191","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634191","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634191/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634191/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2198","end_page":"2206","citing_paper_count":14,"citing_patent_count":3,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Market research","Redundancy","Data analysis","Social network services","Image color analysis","Clustering algorithms"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Market research","Redundancy","Data analysis","Social network services","Image color analysis","Clustering algorithms","Social Data Analysis","Crowdsourcing"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.155","title":"Evaluation of Filesystem Provenance Visualization Tools","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":45,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Harvard University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017334100","id":38017334100,"full_name":"Michelle A.

The most common visual representation of provenance data is the node-link diagram. While effective for understanding local activity, the node-link diagram fails to offer a high-level summary of activity and inter-relationships within the data. We present a new tool, InProv, which displays filesystem provenance with an interactive radial-based tree layout. The tool also utilizes a new time-based hierarchical node grouping method for filesystem provenance data we developed to match the user's mental model and make data exploration more intuitive. We compared InProv to a conventional node-link based tool, Orbiter, in a quantitative evaluation with real users of filesystem provenance data including provenance data experts, IT professionals, and computational scientists. We also compared in the evaluation our new node grouping method to a conventional method. The results demonstrate that InProv results in higher accuracy in identifying system activity than Orbiter with large complex data sets. The results also show that our new time-based hierarchical node grouping method improves performance in both tools, and participants found both tools significantly easier to use with the new time-based node grouping method. Subjective measures show that participants found InProv to require less mental activity, less physical activity, less work, and is less stressful to use. Our study also reveals one of the first cases of gender differences in visualization; both genders had comparable performance with InProv, but women had a significantly lower average accuracy (56%) compared to men (70%) with Orbiter.","article_number":"6634189","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634189","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634189/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634189/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2476","end_page":"2485","citing_paper_count":27,"citing_patent_count":1,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Context awareness","Layout","Encoding"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Context awareness","Layout","Encoding","gender differences","Provenance data","graph/network data","hierarchy data","quantitative evaluation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.170","title":"Interactive Visualizations on Large and Small Displays: The Interrelation of Display Size, Information Space, and Scale","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":46,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Copenhagen","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077537300","id":37077537300,"full_name":"Mikkel R.

Both experimental approaches have limitations. If the information space is kept constant then the scale ratio between an overview of the entire information space and the lowest zoom level varies, which can impact performance; if the information space is varied then the scale ratio is kept constant, but performance cannot be directly compared. In other words, display size, information space, and scale ratio are interrelated variables. We investigate this relation in two experiments with interfaces that implement classic information visualization techniques-focus+context, overview+detail, and zooming-for multi-scale navigation in maps. Display size varied between 0.17, 1.5, and 13.8 megapixels. Information space varied relative to display size in one experiment and was constant in the other. Results suggest that for tasks where users navigate targets that are visible at all map scales the interfaces do not benefit from a large display: With a constant map size, a larger display does not improve performance with the interfaces; with map size varied relative to display size, participants found interfaces harder to use with a larger display and task completion times decrease only when they are normalized to compensate for the increase in map size. The two experimental approaches show different interaction effects between display size and interface. In particular, focus+context performs relatively worse at a large display size with variable map size, and relatively worse at a small display size with a fixed map size. Based on a theoretical analysis of the interaction with the visualization techniques, we examine individual task actions empirically so as to understand the relative impact of display size and scale ratio on the visualization techniques' performance and to discuss differences between the two experimental approaches.","article_number":"6634121","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634121","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634121/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634121/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2336","end_page":"2345","citing_paper_count":13,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Navigation","Interactive systems","Data visualization","Monitoring","Aerospace electronics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Navigation","Interactive systems","Data visualization","Monitoring","Aerospace electronics","user studies","Information visualization","multi-scale navigation","interaction techniques","experimental method"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.198","title":"Supporting the Visual Analysis of Dynamic Networks by Clustering associated Temporal Attributes","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":47,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Rostock","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396082800","id":37396082800,"full_name":"Steffen Hadlak","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"University of Rostock","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283240400","id":37283240400,"full_name":"Heidrun Schumann","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"University of Rostock","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37725105400","id":37725105400,"full_name":"Clemens H.

Yet, tasks are a multi-faceted concept and it is thus not surprising that the many existing task taxonomies and models all describe different aspects of tasks, depending on what these task descriptions aim to capture. This results in a clear need to bring these different aspects together under the common hood of a general design space of visualization tasks, which we propose in this paper. Our design space consists of five design dimensions that characterize the main aspects of tasks and that have so far been distributed across different task descriptions. We exemplify its concrete use by applying our design space in the domain of climate impact research. To this end, we propose interfaces to our design space for different user roles (developers, authors, and end users) that allow users of different levels of expertise to work with it.","article_number":"6634156","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634156","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634156/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634156/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2366","end_page":"2375","citing_paper_count":82,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Taxonomy","Meteorology","Market research"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Taxonomy","Meteorology","Market research","visualization recommendation","Task taxonomy","design space","climate impact research"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.162","title":"HierarchicalTopics: Visually Exploring Large Text Collections Using Topic Hierarchies","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":49,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina at Charlotte","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606064200","id":37606064200,"full_name":"Wenwen Dou","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina at Charlotte","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37534286400","id":37534286400,"full_name":"Li Yu","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina at Charlotte","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601069300","id":37601069300,"full_name":"Xiaoyu Wang","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina at Charlotte","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38251857400","id":38251857400,"full_name":"Zhiqiang Ma","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina at Charlotte","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300425000","id":37300425000,"full_name":"William Ribarsky","author_order":5}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Analyzing large textual collections has become increasingly challenging given the size of the data available and the rate that more data is being generated. Topic-based text summarization methods coupled with interactive visualizations have presented promising approaches to address the challenge of analyzing large text corpora. As the text corpora and vocabulary grow larger, more topics need to be generated in order to capture the meaningful latent themes and nuances in the corpora. However, it is difficult for most of current topic-based visualizations to represent large number of topics without being cluttered or illegible. To facilitate the representation and navigation of a large number of topics, we propose a visual analytics system - HierarchicalTopic (HT). HT integrates a computational algorithm, Topic Rose Tree, with an interactive visual interface. The Topic Rose Tree constructs a topic hierarchy based on a list of topics. The interactive visual interface is designed to present the topic content as well as temporal evolution of topics in a hierarchical fashion. User interactions are provided for users to make changes to the topic hierarchy based on their mental model of the topic space. To qualitatively evaluate HT, we present a case study that showcases how HierarchicalTopics aid expert users in making sense of a large number of topics and discovering interesting patterns of topic groups. We have also conducted a user study to quantitatively evaluate the effect of hierarchical topic structure. The study results reveal that the HT leads to faster identification of large number of relevant topics. We have also solicited user feedback during the experiments and incorporated some suggestions into the current version of HierarchicalTopics.","article_number":"6634160","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634160","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634160/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634160/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2002","end_page":"2011","citing_paper_count":69,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Vocabulary","Analytical models","Text mining","Computational modeling","Algorithm design and analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Vocabulary","Analytical models","Text mining","Computational modeling","Algorithm design and analysis","rose tree","Hierarchical topic representation","topic modeling","visual analytics"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.121","title":"A Lightweight Tangible 3D Interface for Interactive Visualization of Thin Fiber Structures","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":50,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085338605","id":37085338605,"full_name":"Bret Jackson","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086632106","id":37086632106,"full_name":"Tung Yuen Lau","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38514618500","id":38514618500,"full_name":"David Schroeder","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283766000","id":37283766000,"full_name":"Kimani C.

These data are commonly found in current bioimaging datasets, for example second-harmonic generation microscopy of collagen fibers in tissue. Our approach uses commodity visualization technologies such as a depth sensing camera and low-cost 3D display. Unlike most current uses of these emerging technologies in the games and graphics communities, we employ the depth sensing camera to create a fish-tank sterePoscopic virtual reality system at the scientist's desk that supports tracking of small-scale gestures with objects already found in the work space. We apply the new interface to the problem of interactive exploratory visualization of three-dimensional thin fiber data. A critical task for the visual analysis of these data is understanding patterns in fiber orientation throughout a volume.The interface enables a new, fluid style of data exploration and fiber orientation analysis by using props to provide needed passive-haptic feedback, making 3D interactions with these fiber structures more controlled. We also contribute a low-level algorithm for extracting fiber centerlines from volumetric imaging. The system was designed and evaluated with two biophotonic experts who currently use it in their lab. As compared to typical practice within their field, the new visualization system provides a more effective way to examine and understand the 3D bioimaging datasets they collect.","article_number":"6651934","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6651934","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6651934/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6651934/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2802","end_page":"2809","citing_paper_count":23,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three dimensional displays","Data visualization","Microscopy"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Three dimensional displays","Data visualization","Microscopy","microscopy visualization","Scientific visualization","3D interaction","tangible interaction"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.186","title":"ScatterBlogs2: Real-Time Monitoring of Microblog Messages through User-Guided Filtering","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":51,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Visualization and Interactive Systems, University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37683989300","id":37683989300,"full_name":"Harald Bosch","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Visualization and Interactive Systems, University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233559700","id":38233559700,"full_name":"Dennis Thom","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Visualization and Interactive Systems, University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490630000","id":38490630000,"full_name":"Florian Heimerl","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Visualization and Interactive Systems, University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233561200","id":38233561200,"full_name":"Edwin P√ºttmann","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"Visualization and Interactive Systems, University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593029700","id":37593029700,"full_name":"Steffen Koch","author_order":5},{"affiliation":"Visualization and Interactive Systems, University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077786200","id":37077786200,"full_name":"Robert Kr√ºger","author_order":6},{"affiliation":"Visualization and Interactive Systems, University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37667957300","id":37667957300,"full_name":"Michael W√∂rner","author_order":7},{"affiliation":"Visualization and Interactive Systems, University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268023800","id":37268023800,"full_name":"Thomas Ertl","author_order":8}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The number of microblog posts published daily has reached a level that hampers the effective retrieval of relevant messages, and the amount of information conveyed through services such as Twitter is still increasing.

Current tools for monitoring microblogs typically filter messages based on user-defined keyword queries and metadata restrictions. Used on their own, such methods can have drawbacks with respect to filter accuracy and adaptability to changes in trends and topic structure. We suggest ScatterBlogs2, a new approach to let analysts build task-tailored message filters in an interactive and visual manner based on recorded messages of well-understood previous events. These message filters include supervised classification and query creation backed by the statistical distribution of terms and their co-occurrences.

For example, social scientists may want to investigate asymmetric relations in organizations with strict chains of command, or incorporate non-actors such as conferences and projects when analyzing coauthorship patterns. Multimodal social networks are those where actors and relations belong to different types, or modes, and multimodal social network analysis (mSNA) is accordingly SNA for such networks. In this paper, we present a design study that we conducted with several social scientist collaborators on how to support mSNA using visual analytics tools. Based on an openended, formative design process, we devised a visual representation called parallel node-link bands (PNLBs) that splits modes into separate bands and renders connections between adjacent ones, similar to the list view in Jigsaw. We then used the tool in a qualitative evaluation involving five social scientists whose feedback informed a second design phase that incorporated additional network metrics. Finally, we conducted a second qualitative evaluation with our social scientist collaborators that provided further insights on the utility of the PNLBs representation and the potential of visual analytics for mSNA.","article_number":"6634091","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634091","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634091/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634091/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2032","end_page":"2041","citing_paper_count":37,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Social network services","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Complexity theory","Design methodology","User centered design"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Social network services","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Complexity theory","Design methodology","User centered design","qualitative evaluation","Design study","user-centered design","node-link diagrams","multimodal graphs","interaction"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.224","title":"Visual Analytics for Spatial Clustering: Using a Heuristic Approach for Guided Exploration","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":55,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"IBM Research ‚Äì Haifa / Israel, Smarter Decision Solutions Group","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38016629500","id":38016629500,"full_name":"Eli Packer","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"IBM Research ‚Äì Haifa / Israel, Smarter Decision Solutions Group","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077107200","id":37077107200,"full_name":"Peter Bak","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Helsinki Institute for Information Technology, Computer Science Department, University of Helsinki, Finland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077404500","id":37077404500,"full_name":"Mikko Nikkil√§","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Helsinki Institute for Information Technology, Computer Science Department, University of Helsinki, Finland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37947184100","id":37947184100,"full_name":"Valentin Polishchuk","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"IBM Research ‚Äì Haifa / Israel, Smarter Decision Solutions Group","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077662800","id":37077662800,"full_name":"Harold J.

However, its practical use often involves a tedious and time-consuming process of tuning parameters and making application-specific choices. In the absence of training data with labeled clusters, help from a human analyst is required to decide the number of clusters, to determine whether hierarchical clustering is needed, and to define the appropriate distance measures, parameters of the underlying graph, and type of graph Laplacian. We propose to simplify this process via an open-box approach, in which an interactive system visualizes the involved mathematical quantities, suggests parameter values, and provides immediate feedback to support the required decisions. Our framework focuses on applications in 3D image analysis, and links the abstract high-dimensional feature space used in spectral clustering to the three-dimensional data space. This provides a better understanding of the technique, and helps the analyst predict how well specific parameter settings will generalize to similar tasks. In addition, our system supports filtering outliers and labeling the final clusters in such a way that user actions can be recorded and transferred to different data in which the same structures are to be found. Our system supports a wide range of inputs, including triangular meshes, regular grids, and point clouds. We use our system to develop segmentation protocols in chest CT and brain MRI that are then successfully applied to other datasets in an automated manner.","article_number":"6634089","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634089","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634089/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634089/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2100","end_page":"2108","citing_paper_count":25,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image segmentation","Three-dimensional displays","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Laplace equations","Image analysis","Data visualization","Clustering"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Image segmentation","Three-dimensional displays","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Laplace equations","Image analysis","Data visualization","Clustering","programming with example","Image segmentation","spectral clustering","high-dimensional embeddings","linked views"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.226","title":"Visual Exploration of Big Spatio-Temporal Urban Data: A Study of New York City Taxi Trips","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":58,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"NYU Poly","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38018628600","id":38018628600,"full_name":"Nivan Ferreira","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"NYU Poly","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38548192600","id":38548192600,"full_name":"Jorge Poco","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"NYU CUSP","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37549893300","id":37549893300,"full_name":"Huy T.

In this paper, we focus on a particularly important urban data set: taxi trips. Taxis are valuable sensors and information associated with taxi trips can provide unprecedented insight into many different aspects of city life, from economic activity and human behavior to mobility patterns. But analyzing these data presents many challenges. The data are complex, containing geographical and temporal components in addition to multiple variables associated with each trip. Consequently, it is hard to specify exploratory queries and to perform comparative analyses (e.g., compare different regions over time). This problem is compounded due to the size of the data-there are on average 500,000 taxi trips each day in NYC. We propose a new model that allows users to visually query taxi trips. Besides standard analytics queries, the model supports origin-destination queries that enable the study of mobility across the city. We show that this model is able to express a wide range of spatio-temporal queries, and it is also flexible in that not only can queries be composed but also different aggregations and visual representations can be applied, allowing users to explore and compare results. We have built a scalable system that implements this model which supports interactive response times; makes use of an adaptive level-of-detail rendering strategy to generate clutter-free visualization for large results; and shows hidden details to the users in a summary through the use of overlay heat maps. We present a series of case studies motivated by traffic engineers and economists that show how our model and system enable domain experts to perform tasks that were previously unattainable for them.","article_number":"6634127","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634127","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634127/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634127/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2149","end_page":"2158","citing_paper_count":262,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Cities and towns","Data visualization","Data models","Analytical models","Time factors","Mathematical model"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Cities and towns","Data visualization","Data models","Analytical models","Time factors","Mathematical model","visual exploration","Spatio-temporal queries","urban data","NYC taxis"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.148","title":"Detecting Symmetry in Scalar Fields Using Augmented Extremum Graphs","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":59,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Indian Institute of Science","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38258503300","id":38258503300,"full_name":"Dilip Mathew Thomas","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Indian Institute of Science","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37278509300","id":37278509300,"full_name":"Vijay Natarajan","author_order":2}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Visualizing symmetric patterns in the data often helps the domain scientists make important observations and gain insights about the underlying experiment.

The augmented extremum graph captures both topological and geometric information of the scalar field and enables robust and computationally efficient detection of symmetry. We apply the proposed method to detect symmetries in cryo-electron microscopy datasets and the experiments demonstrate that the algorithm is capable of detecting symmetry even in the presence of significant noise.

In this design study, we worked with four analysts to design a visualization tool supporting variant impact assessment for three different tasks. We contribute data and task abstractions for the problem of variant impact assessment, and the carefully justified design and implementation of the Variant View tool.

Our layouts are 3.9 and 1.6 times more compact on average than outline layouts and horizontally unconstrained table layouts, respectively, and are as readable as table layouts even for large datasets.","article_number":"6634099","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634099","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634099/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634099/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2586","end_page":"2595","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Layout","Data visualization","XML"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Layout","Data visualization","XML","layout management","Hierarchy data","tabular data","nested relations"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.228","title":"Visual Traffic Jam Analysis Based on Trajectory Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":67,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37404943000","id":37404943000,"full_name":"Zuchao Wang","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University, and Center for Computational Science and Engineering, Peking University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38238228600","id":38238228600,"full_name":"Min Lu","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University, and Center for Computational Science and Engineering, Peking University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403856700","id":37403856700,"full_name":"Xiaoru Yuan","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Shanghai Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing, and School of Computer Science, Fudan University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37281470200","id":37281470200,"full_name":"Junping Zhang","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294473300","id":37294473300,"full_name":"Huub Van De Wetering","author_order":5}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this work, we present an interactive system for visual analysis of urban traffic congestion based on GPS trajectories.

This special type of multivariate time series data is relevant in many research fields including medicine, sports and animation. Key tasks in working with motion data include analysis of motion states and transitions, and synthesis of motion vectors by interpolation and combination. In the practice of research and application of human motion data, challenges exist in providing visual summaries and drill-down functionality for handling large motion data collections. We find that this domain can benefit from appropriate visual retrieval and analysis support to handle these tasks in presence of large motion data. To address this need, we developed MotionExplorer together with domain experts as an exploratory search system based on interactive aggregation and visualization of motion states as a basis for data navigation, exploration, and search. Based on an overview-first type visualization, users are able to search for interesting sub-sequences of motion based on a query-by-example metaphor, and explore search results by details on demand. We developed MotionExplorer in close collaboration with the targeted users who are researchers working on human motion synthesis and analysis, including a summative field study. Additionally, we conducted a laboratory design study to substantially improve MotionExplorer towards an intuitive, usable and robust design. MotionExplorer enables the search in human motion capture data with only a few mouse clicks. The researchers unanimously confirm that the system can efficiently support their work.","article_number":"6634102","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634102","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634102/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634102/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2257","end_page":"2266","citing_paper_count":44,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Data visualization","Time series analysis","Databases","Data collection"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Data visualization","Time series analysis","Databases","Data collection","cluster glyph","Visual analytics","exploratory search","multivariate time series","motion capture data","data aggregation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.179","title":"Nanocubes for Real-Time Exploration of Spatiotemporal Datasets","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":69,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"AT&T Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37682897900","id":37682897900,"full_name":"Lauro Lins","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"AT&T Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37442701500","id":37442701500,"full_name":"James T.

Are certain attributes correlated spatially or temporally? Are there trends or outliers in the data? Answering these questions requires aggregation over arbitrary regions of the domain and attributes of the data. Many relational databases implement the well-known data cube aggregation operation, which in a sense precomputes every possible aggregate query over the database. Data cubes are sometimes assumed to take a prohibitively large amount of space, and to consequently require disk storage. In contrast, we show how to construct a data cube that fits in a modern laptop's main memory, even for billions of entries; we call this data structure a nanocube. We present algorithms to compute and query a nanocube, and show how it can be used to generate well-known visual encodings such as heatmaps, histograms, and parallel coordinate plots. When compared to exact visualizations created by scanning an entire dataset, nanocube plots have bounded screen error across a variety of scales, thanks to a hierarchical structure in space and time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique on a variety of real-world datasets, and present memory, timing, and network bandwidth measurements. We find that the timings for the queries in our examples are dominated by network and user-interaction latencies.","article_number":"6634137","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634137","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634137/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634137/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2456","end_page":"2465","citing_paper_count":118,"citing_patent_count":2,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Androids","Humanoid robots","Nanostructured materials","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Encoding"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Androids","Humanoid robots","Nanostructured materials","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Encoding","interactive exploration","Data cube","data structures"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.205","title":"The Impact of Physical Navigation on Spatial Organization for Sensemaking","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":70,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Middlebury College","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37587847300","id":37587847300,"full_name":"Christopher Andrews","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37419565900","id":37419565900,"full_name":"Chris North","author_order":2}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Spatial organization has been proposed as a compelling approach to externalizing the sensemaking process.

In this study we explicitly examined the use of spatial sensemaking techniques within these two environments.

Shot-based, spatiotemporal clustering of the data generates potential areas of interest that can be filtered interactively. We also facilitate data drill-down: the gaze points are shown with density-based color mapping and individual scan paths as lines in the space-time cube. The analytical process is supported by multiple coordinated views that allow the user to focus on different aspects of spatial and temporal information in eye gaze data. Common eye-tracking visualization techniques are extended to incorporate the spatiotemporal characteristics of the data. For example, heat maps are extended to motion-compensated heat maps and trajectories of scan paths are included in the space-time visualization.

We conduct a qualitative analysis of 42 professional narrative visualizations to gain empirical knowledge on the forms that structure and sequence take. Based on the results of this study we propose a graph-driven approach for automatically identifying effective sequences in a set of visualizations to be presented linearly. Our approach identifies possible transitions in a visualization set and prioritizes local (visualization-to-visualization) transitions based on an objective function that minimizes the cost of transitions from the audience perspective. We conduct two studies to validate this function. We also expand the approach with additional knowledge of user preferences for different types of local transitions and the effects of global sequencing strategies on memory, preference, and comprehension. Our results include a relative ranking of types of visualization transitions by the audience perspective and support for memory and subjective rating benefits of visualization sequences that use parallelism as a structural device.

We present a novel way to explore a high number of individual objects in a dataset, e.g., pores, inclusions, particles, fibers, and cracks demonstrated on the special application area of pore extraction in carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP). After calculating the individual object properties volume, dimensions and shape factors, all objects are clustered into a mean object (MObject). The resulting MObject parameter space can be explored interactively. To do so, we introduce the visualization of mean object sets (MObject Sets) in a radial and a parallel arrangement. Each MObject may be split up into sub-classes by selecting a specific property, e.g., volume or shape factor, and the desired number of classes. Applying this interactive selection iteratively leads to the intended classifications and visualizations of MObjects along the selected analysis path. Hereby the given different scaling factors of the MObjects down the analysis path are visualized through a visual linking approach. Furthermore the representative MObjects are exported as volumetric datasets to serve as input for successive calculations and simulations. In the field of porosity determination in CFRP non-destructive testing practitioners use representative MObjects to improve ultrasonic calibration curves. Representative pores also serve as input for heat conduction simulations in active thermography. For a fast overview of the pore properties in a dataset we propose a local MObjects visualization in combination with a color-coded homogeneity visualization of cells. The advantages of our novel approach are demonstrated using real world CFRP specimens. The results were evaluated through a questionnaire in order to determine the practicality of the MObjects visualization as a supportive tool for domain specialists.","article_number":"6634106","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634106","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634106/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634106/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2906","end_page":"2915","citing_paper_count":16,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","X-ray tomography","Biomedical imaging","Transfer functions","Three-dimensional displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","X-ray tomography","Biomedical imaging","Transfer functions","Three-dimensional displays","MObjects","3D X-Ray computed tomography","carbon fiber reinforced polymers","porosity","parameter space analysis"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.132","title":"An Extensible Framework for Provenance in Human Terrain Visual Analytics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":75,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Middlesex University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077009200","id":37077009200,"full_name":"Rick Walker","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"City University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590960700","id":37590960700,"full_name":"Aiden Slingsby","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"City University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37605079900","id":37605079900,"full_name":"Jason Dykes","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Middlesex University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273812200","id":37273812200,"full_name":"Kai Xu","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"City University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399045100","id":37399045100,"full_name":"Jo Wood","author_order":5},{"affiliation":"Middlesex University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490354300","id":38490354300,"full_name":"Phong H.

Working closely with defence analysts we extract requirements and a list of features that characterise data analysed at the end of the HTA chain. From these, we select an appropriate non-classified data source with analogous features, and model it as a set of facets. We develop ProveML, an XML-based extension of the Open Provenance Model, using these facets and augment it with the structures necessary to record the provenance of data, analytical process and interpretations. Through an iterative process, we develop and refine a prototype system for Human Terrain Visual Analytics (HTVA), and demonstrate means of storing, browsing and recalling analytical provenance and process through analytic bookmarks in ProveML.

Our goal is to reflect on a meta-level about evaluation in our community through a systematic understanding of the characteristics and goals of presented evaluations. For this purpose we conducted a systematic review of ten years of evaluations in the published papers using and extending a coding scheme previously established by Lam et al. [2012]. The results of our review include an overview of the most common evaluation goals in the community, how they evolved over time, and how they contrast or align to those of the IEEE Information Visualization conference. In particular, we found that evaluations specific to assessing resulting images and algorithm performance are the most prevalent (with consistently 80-90% of all papers since 1997). However, especially over the last six years there is a steady increase in evaluation methods that include participants, either by evaluating their performances and subjective feedback or by evaluating their work practices and their improved analysis and reasoning capabilities using visual tools. Up to 2010, this trend in the IEEE Visualization conference was much more pronounced than in the IEEE Information Visualization conference which only showed an increasing percentage of evaluation through user performance and experience testing. Since 2011, however, also papers in IEEE Information Visualization show such an increase of evaluations of work practices and analysis as well as reasoning using visual tools. Further, we found that generally the studies reporting requirements analyses and domain-specific work practices are too informally reported which hinders cross-comparison and lowers external validity.","article_number":"6634108","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634108","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634108/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634108/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2818","end_page":"2827","citing_paper_count":135,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Encoding","Data visualization","History","Systematics","Mathematical model"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Encoding","Data visualization","History","Systematics","Mathematical model","information visualization","Evaluation","validation","systematic review","visualization","scientific visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.222","title":"Visual Analytics for Model Selection in Time Series Analysis","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":78,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Vienna University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077691500","id":37077691500,"full_name":"Markus B√∂gl","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Vienna University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267339500","id":37267339500,"full_name":"Wolfgang Aigner","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Vienna University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017354300","id":38017354300,"full_name":"Peter Filzmoser","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Vienna University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37646290500","id":37646290500,"full_name":"Tim Lammarsch","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"Vienna University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282584500","id":37282584500,"full_name":"Silvia Miksch","author_order":5},{"affiliation":"Vienna University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077207200","id":37077207200,"full_name":"Alexander Rind","author_order":6}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Model selection in time series analysis is a challenging task for domain experts in many application areas such as epidemiology, economy, or environmental sciences.

They reduce the complexity of the overall biological network by partitioning it into smaller manageable parts. While this reduction of complexity is their biggest strength, it is, at the same time, their biggest weakness. By removing what is deemed not important for the primary function of the pathway, biologists lose the ability to follow and understand cross-talks between pathways. Considering these cross-talks is, however, critical in many analysis scenarios, such as judging effects of drugs. In this paper we introduce Entourage, a novel visualization technique that provides contextual information lost due to the artificial partitioning of the biological network, but at the same time limits the presented information to what is relevant to the analyst's task. We use one pathway map as the focus of an analysis and allow a larger set of contextual pathways. For these context pathways we only show the contextual subsets, i.e., the parts of the graph that are relevant to a selection. Entourage suggests related pathways based on similarities and highlights parts of a pathway that are interesting in terms of mapped experimental data. We visualize interdependencies between pathways using stubs of visual links, which we found effective yet not obtrusive. By combining this approach with visualization of experimental data, we can provide domain experts with a highly valuable tool. We demonstrate the utility of Entourage with case studies conducted with a biochemist who researches the effects of drugs on pathways. We show that the technique is well suited to investigate interdependencies between pathways and to analyze, understand, and predict the effect that drugs have on different cell types.","article_number":"6634190","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634190","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634190/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634190/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2536","end_page":"2545","citing_paper_count":28,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Drugs","Portals","Context awareness","Biological system modeling","Data visualization","Bioinformatics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Drugs","Portals","Context awareness","Biological system modeling","Data visualization","Bioinformatics","biomolecular data","Pathway visualization","biological networks","subsets","graphs"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.160","title":"GPLOM: The Generalized Plot Matrix for Visualizing Multidimensional Multivariate Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":80,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"√©cole de technologie sup√©rieure","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077216400","id":37077216400,"full_name":"Jean-Fran√ßois Im","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"√©cole de technologie sup√©rieure","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38526446600","id":38526446600,"full_name":"Michael J.

However, these techniques are not well suited to visualizing many categorical variables (i.e., independent variables or dimensions). To visualize multiple categorical variables, 'hierarchical axes' that 'stack dimensions' have been used in systems like Polaris and Tableau. However, this approach does not scale well beyond a small number of categorical variables. Emerson et al. [8] extend the matrix paradigm of the SPLOM to simultaneously visualize several categorical and continuous variables, displaying many kinds of charts in the matrix depending on the kinds of variables involved. We propose a variant of their technique, called the Generalized Plot Matrix (GPLOM). The GPLOM restricts Emerson et al.'s technique to only three kinds of charts (scatterplots for pairs of continuous variables, heatmaps for pairs of categorical variables, and barcharts for pairings of categorical and continuous variable), in an effort to make it easier to understand. At the same time, the GPLOM extends Emerson et al.'s work by demonstrating interactive techniques suited to the matrix of charts. We discuss the visual design and interactive features of our GPLOM prototype, including a textual search feature allowing users to quickly locate values or variables by name. We also present a user study that compared performance with Tableau and our GPLOM prototype, that found that GPLOM is significantly faster in certain cases, and not significantly slower in other cases.","article_number":"6634192","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634192","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634192/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634192/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2606","end_page":"2614","citing_paper_count":27,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Prototypes","Visual databases"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Prototypes","Visual databases","business intelligence","Multidimensional data","tabular data","relational data","mdmv","high-dimensional data","database visualization","databaseoverview","parallel coordinates","scatterplot matrix","user interfaces"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.149","title":"DiffAni: Visualizing Dynamic Graphs with a Hybrid of Difference Maps and Animation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":81,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"√©cole de technologie sup√©rieure","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077522300","id":37077522300,"full_name":"S√©bastien Rufiange","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"√©cole de technologie sup√©rieure","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38526446600","id":38526446600,"full_name":"Michael J.

Group movement is analyzed at two levels of granularity: the group as a whole and the individuals it comprises. For analyzing the relative positions and movements of the individuals with respect to the rest of the group, we apply space transformation, in which the trajectories of the individuals are converted from geographical space to an abstract 'group space'. The group space reference system is defined by both the position of the group center, which is taken as the coordinate origin, and the direction of the group's movement. Based on the individuals' positions mapped onto the group space, we can compare the behaviors of different individuals, determine their roles and/or ranks within the groups, and, possibly, understand how group movement is organized. The utility of the methodology has been evaluated by applying it to a set of real data concerning movements of wild social animals and discussing the results with experts in animal ethology.","article_number":"6634194","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634194","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634194/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634194/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2169","end_page":"2178","citing_paper_count":36,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Trajectory","Visual analytics","Market research","Behavioral science","Data models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Trajectory","Visual analytics","Market research","Behavioral science","Data models","collective movement","Visual analytics","movement data"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.140","title":"Common Angle Plots as Perception-True Visualizations of Categorical Associations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":85,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Iowa State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592793000","id":37592793000,"full_name":"Heike Hofmann","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Iowa State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077871900","id":37077871900,"full_name":"Marie Vendettuoli","author_order":2}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Visualizations are great tools of communications-they summarize findings and quickly convey main messages to our audience.

Particularly when collaborators are located at a distance, it is important to know what everyone is working on in order to avoid duplication of effort, share relevant results in a timely manner and build upon each other's results. Can a person's brushing actions provide an indication of their queries and interests in a data set? Can these actions be revealed to a collaborator without substantially disrupting their own independent work? We designed a study to answer these questions in the context of distributed collaborative visualization of tabular data. Participants in our study worked independently to answer questions about a tabular data set, while simultaneously viewing brushing actions of a fictitious collaborator, shown directly within a shared workspace. We compared three methods of presenting the collaborator's actions: brushing & linking (i.e. highlighting exactly what the collaborator would see), selection (i.e. showing only a selected item), and persistent selection (i.e. showing only selected items but having them persist for some time). Our results demonstrated that persistent selection enabled some awareness of the collaborator's activities while causing minimal interference with independent work. Other techniques were less effective at providing awareness, and brushing & linking caused substantial interference. These findings suggest promise for the idea of exploiting natural brushing actions to provide awareness in collaborative work.","article_number":"6634130","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634130","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634130/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634130/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"2189","end_page":"2197","citing_paper_count":12,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Context awareness","Collaborative work"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Context awareness","Collaborative work","user study","Collaboration","awareness","attentionally ambient visualization","brushing and linking","linked views"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.166","title":"Information Visualization and Proxemics: Design Opportunities and Empirical Findings","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":93,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Copenhagen","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077537300","id":37077537300,"full_name":"Mikkel R.

However, in many applications, machine learning alone is impractical since videos may not be semantically annotated sufficiently, there may be a lack of suitable training data, and the search requirements of the user may frequently change for different tasks. In this work, we develop a visual analytics systems that overcomes the shortcomings of the traditional approach. We make use of a sketch-based interface to enable users to specify search requirement in a flexible manner without depending on semantic annotation. We employ active machine learning to train different analytical models for different types of search requirements.

However, most of the widely-used methods based on probabilistic modeling have drawbacks in terms of consistency from multiple runs and empirical convergence. Furthermore, due to the complicatedness in the formulation and the algorithm, LDA cannot easily incorporate various types of user feedback.

Centered around its semi-supervised formulation, UTOPIAN enables users to interact with the topic modeling method and steer the result in a user-driven manner.

We only consider techniques that offer a lossless compression: that is, where the entire graph can still be read from the compressed version. The techniques considered are: a simple grouping of nodes with identical neighbor sets; Modular Decomposition which permits internal structure in modules and allows them to be nested; and Power Graph Analysis which further allows edges to cross module boundaries. These techniques all have the same goal-to compress the set of edges that need to be rendered to fully convey connectivity-but each successive relaxation of the module definition permits fewer edges to be drawn in the rendered graph. Each successive technique also, we hypothesize, requires a higher degree of mental effort to interpret. We test this hypothetical trade-off with two studies involving human participants. For Power Graph Analysis we propose a novel optimal technique based on constraint programming. This enables us to explore the parameter space for the technique more precisely than could be achieved with a heuristic.

Automated approaches for building regression models are typically limited with respect to incorporating domain knowledge in the process of selecting input variables (also known as feature subset selection). Other limitations include the identification of local structures, transformations, and interactions between variables. The contribution of this paper is a framework for building regression models addressing these limitations. The framework combines a qualitative analysis of relationship structures by visualization and a quantification of relevance for ranking any number of features and pairs of features which may be categorical or continuous. A central aspect is the local approximation of the conditional target distribution by partitioning 1D and 2D feature domains into disjoint regions. This enables a visual investigation of local patterns and largely avoids structural assumptions for the quantitative ranking. We describe how the framework supports different tasks in model building (e.g., validation and comparison), and we present an interactive workflow for feature subset selection. A real-world case study illustrates the step-wise identification of a five-dimensional model for natural gas consumption. We also report feedback from domain experts after two months of deployment in the energy sector, indicating a significant effort reduction for building and improving regression models.","article_number":"6634169","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6634169","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634169/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634169/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6634084,"publication_year":2013,"publication_date":"Dec. 2013","start_page":"1962","end_page":"1971","citing_paper_count":62,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Modeling","Regression analysis","Computational modeling","Feature extraction","Frequency-domain analysis","Complexity theory"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Modeling","Regression analysis","Computational modeling","Feature extraction","Frequency-domain analysis","Complexity theory","guided visualization","Regression","model building","visual knowledge discovery","feature selection","data partitioning"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2013.163","title":"Hybrid-Image Visualization for Large Viewing Environments","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":101,"volume":"19","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"INRIA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591317800","id":37591317800,"full_name":"Petra Isenberg","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"INRIA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590932700","id":37590932700,"full_name":"Pierre Dragicevic","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"INRIA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945380800","id":37945380800,"full_name":"Wesley Willett","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"LRI (Univ.

In addition, TreeVersity2 provides overviews of change over the entire time period, and a reporting tool that lists outliers in textual form, which helps users identify the major changes in the data without having to manually setup filters. We validated TreeVersity2 with 12 case studies with organizations as diverse as the National Cancer Institute, Federal Drug Administration, Department of Transportation, Office of the Bursar of the University of Maryland, or eBay.
