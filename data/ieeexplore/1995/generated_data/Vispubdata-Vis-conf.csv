This paper describes improvements and extensions of the basic principle of spot noise. First, better visualization of highly curved vector fields with spot noise is achieved, by adapting the shape of the spots to the local velocity field. Second, filtering of spots is proposed to eliminate undesired low frequency components from the spot noise texture. Third, methods are described to utilize graphics hardware to generate the texture, and to produce variable viewpoint animations of spot noise on surfaces. Fourth, the synthesis of spot noise on grids with highly irregular cell sizes is described.",,W.C. de Leeuw;J.J. van Wijk,"Faculty of Technical Mathematics and Informatics, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands;ECN, Netherlands Energy Research Foundation (ECN), Petten, Netherlands",,,,42,,
Vis-conf,1995,Sweeping simplices: a fast iso-surface extraction algorithm for unstructured grids,10.1109/VISUAL.1995.480806,https://doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1995.480806,143,150,Conferences,"Presents an algorithm that accelerates the extraction of iso-surfaces from unstructured grids by avoiding the traversal of the entire set of cells in the volume. The algorithm consists of a sweep algorithm and a data decomposition scheme. The sweep algorithm incrementally locates intersected elements, and the data decomposition scheme restricts the algorithm's worst-case performance. For data sets consisting of hundreds of thousands of elements, our algorithm can reduce the cell traversal time by more than 90% over the naive iso-surface extraction algorithm, thus facilitating interactive probing of scalar fields for large-scale problems on unstructured three-dimensional grids.",,Han-Wei Shen;C.R.

This technique imposes considerable demands on storage space as the data set grows in size. In this paper, we describe a method to render compressed volume data directly to reduce the memory requirements of the rendering process. The volume data was compressed by a technique called the Laplacian pyramid. A compression ratio of 10:1 was achieved by uniform quantization over the Laplacian pyramid. The quality of the images obtained by this technique as virtually indistinguishable from that of the images generated from the uncompressed volume data. A significant improvement in computational performance was achieved by using a cache algorithm to temporarily retain the reconstructed voxels to be used by the adjacent rays.",,M.H. Ghavamnia;X.D.

For certain important classes of data, this is an approximation to summation rendering which produces superior visualizations. We show how maximum projection rendering with additional depth cues can be implemented using simple affine transformations in object space. This technique can be used together with 3D graphics libraries and standard graphics hardware, thus allowing interactive manipulations of the volume data.

Data uncertainty is typically ignored, and a deficiency of many interpolation schemes is smoothing which may indicate features or characteristics of the data that are not there. The author investigates the use of iterated function systems (IFS's) for interpolation. He shows new derivations for fractal interpolation in two and three dimensional scalar data, and new point and polytope rendering algorithms with tremendous speed advantages over ray tracing. The interpolations may be used to give an indication of the uncertainty of the data, statistically represent the data at a variety of scales, allow tunability from the data, and may allow more accurate data analysis.",,C.M.

The resulting unsteady flow volumes are the 3D analogs of streaklines. There are few examples where methods other than particle tracing have been used to visualize time-varying flows. Since particle paths can become convoluted in time, there are additional considerations to be made when extending any visualization technique to unsteady flows.

The paper presents a new technique that enhances the speed of splatting without trading off image quality. This new method reduces rendering time by employing a simple indexing mechanism which allows to visit and splat only the voxels of interest. It is shown that this algorithm is suitable for the dynamic situation in which viewing parameters and opacity transfer functions change interactively. We report experimental results on several test data sets of useful site and complexity, and discuss the cost/benefit trade off of our method.",,Insung Ihm;Rae Kyoung Lee,"Department of Computer Science, Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea;Department of Computer Science, Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea",,,,7,,

Concurrent with the development of the electronics of this movement and position tracking (MAP) tracking system has been the development of ways to analyze data from the MAP system. Spray rendering has been used to visualize the data and to combine it with environmental data allowing biologists view the animals activity in an environmental context.

Vis-conf,1995,Volume-based reasoning and visualization of diecastability,10.1109/VISUAL.1995.485152,https://doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1995.485152,359,362,Conferences,"Because of the nature of the die casting process, the part geometry severely restricts the die geometry and hence affects the quality of the part. However, as is often the case in other manufacturing processes, diecastings are currently designed purely based on their function. The manufacturability of the diecastings is not considered until the design has been nearly completed and detailed. This is due to the design support limitations of current CAE tools. We present a new volume-based approach to support diecastability evaluation, especially in preliminary design. Our approach can be applied to arbitrarily shaped parts without pre-defined feature libraries. The focus is on the identification of geometric characteristics, e.g. heavy mass regions, that could be responsible for thermal-related part defects. A distance transform with city-block metric is used to extract this geometric property. Volume visualization techniques are also adopted to allow users to visualize the results in a clear and precise way.",,R. Yagel;S.C. Lu;A.B. Rebello;R.A.

Usual tools in dynamical systems such as analysis and numerical simulations alone are often not sufficient to understand the complicated mechanisms that cause changes in these manifolds. Computer-graphical visualization is a natural and powerful addition to these tools used for the qualitative study of dynamical systems, especially for the study of invariant manifolds. The dynamics of two linearly coupled oscillators is the focus of this case study. With little or no coupling between the oscillators, an invariant torus is present but it breaks down for strong coupling. Visualization has been employed to gain a qualitative understanding of this breakdown process. The visualization has allowed key features of the tori to be recognized, and it has proven to be indispensable in developing and testing hypotheses about the tori.",,D.H. Hepting;G. Derks;K.D.

However, in order to interpret computational results, there is a clear preference among scientists and engineers for visualization in analogy with experimental techniques. One such technique, particle tracing, enables a dynamic (Lagrangian) interpretation of a statically (Eulerian) computed vector field. However, quite often the emphasis in particle tracing is only on the mean flow properties, while effects due to dispersion and mixing are often not accounted for. Hence turbulent flow characteristics have to be incorporated in a visualization system for practical hydraulic engineering problems. The particle tracing technique presented in this case study has been specifically developed to combine both mean and fluctuating velocity vectors, thus simulating stochastic perturbations around mean flow conditions. A number of cases are presented that demonstrate the practical applicability of advanced visualization techniques in realistic engineering studies.",,A.E. Mynett;I.A. Sadarjoen;A.J.S.

The trout representation was generated in stepwise fashion: cross sectional images were obtained from an anesthetized fish using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system; images were processed to classify tissue types; images were stacked and processed to create a three dimensional representation of the fish, encapsulating five volumes corresponding to the liver, kidney, muscle, gastrointestinal tract, and fat. Kinetic data for the disposition of pentachloroethane in trout were generated using a PB-TK model.

Volume data does not holds the geometric information for the surface comprising points, so it is necessary to calculate normals using local information at each point. The existing normal estimation methods have some problems of estimating incorrect normals at discontinuous, aliased or noisy points. Yagel et al. (1992) solved some of these problems using their context-sensitive method. However, this method requires too much processing time and it loses some information on detailed parts of the object surfaces. This paper proposes the surface-characteristic-sensitive normal estimation method which applies different operators according to characteristics of each surface for the normal calculation. This method has the same advantages of the context-sensitive method, and also some other advantages such as less processing time and the reduction of the information loss on detailed parts.",,Byeong Seok Shin;Yeong Gil Shin,"Department of Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea;Department of Computer Science and Statistics, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea",,,,1,,

In this paper, we propose a new visualization technique called a 'recursive pattern', which has been developed for visualizing large amounts of multidimensional data. The technique is based on a generic recursive scheme which generalizes a wide range of pixel-oriented arrangements for displaying large data sets. By instantiating the technique with adequate data- and application-dependent parameters, the user may greatly influence the structure of the resulting visualizations. Since the technique uses one pixel for presenting each data value, the amount of data which can be displayed is only limited by the resolution of current display technology and by the limitations of human perceptibility. Beside describing the basic idea of the 'recursive pattern' technique, we provide several examples of useful parameter settings for the various recursion levels. We further show that our 'recursive pattern' technique is particularly advantageous for the large class of data sets which have a natural order according to one dimension (e.g. time series data). We demonstrate the usefulness of our technique by using a stock market application.",,D.A. Keim;H.-P. Kriegel;M.

The objective in these cases is to render the layered surfaces in a such way that the outer structures can be seen and seen through at the same time. The paper focuses on the particular application of radiation therapy treatment planning, in which physicians need to understand the three dimensional distribution of radiation dose in the context of patient anatomy. We describe a promising technique for communicating the shape and position of the transparent skin surface while at the same time minimally occluding underlying isointensity dose surfaces and anatomical objects: adding a sparse, opaque texture comprised of a small set of carefully chosen lines. We explain the perceptual motivation for explicitly drawing ridge and valley curves on a transparent surface, describe straightforward mathematical techniques for detecting and rendering these lines, and propose a small number of reasonably effective methods for selectively emphasizing the most perceptually relevant lines in the display.",,V.

Feature extraction is viewed as a process of data abstraction, which can proceed in multiple stages, and corresponding data abstraction levels. The features are represented by attribute sets, which play a key role in the visualization process. Icons are symbolic parametric objects, designed as visual representations of features. The attributes are mapped to the parameters (or degrees of freedom) of an icon. We describe some generic techniques to generate attribute sets, such as volume integrals and medial axis transforms.

These estimates are determined by a wavelet representation of the surface data. The basic idea is to decompose the initial data set by means of an orthogonal or semi-orthogonal tensor product wavelet transform (WT) and to analyze the resulting coefficients. In surface regions where the partial energy of the resulting coefficients is low, the polygonal approximation of the surface can be performed with larger triangles without losing too much fine-grain detail. However, since the localization of the WT is bound by the Heisenberg principle, the meshing method has to be controlled by the detail signals rather than directly by the coefficients. The dyadic scaling of the WT stimulated us to build a hierarchical meshing algorithm which transforms the initially regular data grid into a quadtree representation by rejection of unimportant mesh vertices. The optimum triangulation of the resulting quadtree cells is carried out by selection from a look-up table. The tree grows recursively, as controlled by the detail signals, which are computed from a modified inverse WT. In order to control the local level-of-detail, we introduce a new class of wavelet space filters acting as ""magnifying glasses"" on the data.",,M.H. Gross;R. Gatti;O.

Integration accuracy is maintained using an adaptive step size control scheme which is regulated by the path line curvature. The problem of point location and interpolation in physical space is simplified by decomposing hexahedral cells into tetrahedral cells.
