The low cost of quantized methods, which rely on table lookup and minimal arithmetic, are weighed against the increased accuracy offered by incremental methods, which maintain error indicators to ensure minimal differences between ideal and generated chain codes.

The isophote method analyzes surfaces by determining lines of equal light intensity. Silhouettes are special isophotes. A different approach to these problems is the mapping-technique. The mapping methods recognize unwanted curvature regions by detecting singularities of a special mapping of the curve or surface investigated.

The algorithm can be used as a subroutine for algorithms which are able to perform more general intersections of free-form volumes, e.g. Boolean operations on two free-form volumes.<>","article_number":"146403","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=146403","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/146403/","publication_title":"Proceedings of the First IEEE Conference on Visualization: Visualization `90","conference_location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","conference_dates":"23-26 Oct. 1990","publication_number":311,"is_number":3914,"publication_year":1990,"publication_date":"23-26 Oct. 1990","start_page":"379","end_page":"386","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Polynomials","Algorithms","Design automation","Computer aided manufacturing","CADCAM","Mathematics","Application software","Data engineering","Shape"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-2083-8","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1990.146367","title":"Extracting geometric models through constraint minimization","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-2083-8","rank":50,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Rensselaer Design.

This is accomplished by starting with a simple model that is already topologically closed and deforming the model, based on a set of constraints, so that the model grows (shrinks) to fit the feature within the image while maintaining its closed and locally simple nature. The initial model is a non-self-intersecting polygon that is either embedded in the feature or surrounds the feature. There is a cost function associated with every vertex that quantifies its deformation, the properties of simple polygons, and the relationship between noise and feature. The constraints embody local properties of simple polygons and the nature of the relationship between noise and the features in the image.<>","article_number":"146367","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=146367","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/146367/","publication_title":"Proceedings of the First IEEE Conference on Visualization: Visualization `90","conference_location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","conference_dates":"23-26 Oct. 1990","publication_number":311,"is_number":3914,"publication_year":1990,"publication_date":"23-26 Oct. 1990","start_page":"74","end_page":"82","citing_paper_count":6,"citing_patent_count":1,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Solid modeling","Deformable models","Data mining","Geometry","Layout","Image edge detection","Data visualization","Minimization methods","Spline","Shape"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-2083-8","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1990.146371","title":"Visualizing computer memory architectures","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-2083-8","rank":51,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"IBM Thomas J.

The model is more faithful to the structure of computers than the Von Neumann and Turing models. It addresses the issues of data movement and exposes and unifies storage mechanisms such as cache, translation lookaside buffers, main memory, and disks. The visual language presents the details of a computer's memory hierarchy in a concise drawing composed of rectangles and connecting segments. Using this framework, the authors improved the performance of a matrix multiplication algorithm by more than an order of magnitude. The framework gives insight into computer architecture and performance bottlenecks by making effective use of human visual abilities.<>","article_number":"146371","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=146371","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/146371/","publication_title":"Proceedings of the First IEEE Conference on Visualization: Visualization `90","conference_location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","conference_dates":"23-26 Oct. 1990","publication_number":311,"is_number":3914,"publication_year":1990,"publication_date":"23-26 Oct. 1990","start_page":"107","end_page":"113","citing_paper_count":11,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Computer architecture","Memory architecture","Random access memory","Turing machines","Read-write memory","Buffer storage","Wires","Cache storage","Joining processes"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-2083-8","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1990.146373","title":"Moving iconic objects in scientific visualization","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":"0-8186-2083-8","rank":52,"authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Tektronix Labs., Beaverton, OR, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38222544200","id":38222544200,"full_name":"D.G.

Bird-oid objects or boids are discussed. These boids derive from: (1) icons which are geometric objects whose shape and appearance are related to the field variables, (2) three-dimensional cursors by which a user interactively picks a point in space, (3) particle traces, which are numerically integrated trajectories in space, (4) moving frames of vectors along space curves, and (5) actors, which are programming objects that can create and destroy instances of themselves, act according to internal logic, and communicate with each other and with a user.

A simple preprocessing step identifies the voxels representing features of interest. Frequently this set of voxels, arbitrarily distributed in three-dimensional space, is a small fraction of the original voxel grid. A median-cut space partitioning scheme, combined with bounding volumes to prune void spaces in the resulting search structure, is used to store the voxels of interest in a k-d tree. The k-d tree is used as a data structure. The tree is then efficiently ray-traced to render the voxel data. The k-d tree is view independent, and can be used for animation sequences involving changes in positions of the viewer or positions of lights. This search structure has been applied to render voxel data from MRI, CAT scan, and electron density distributions.<>","article_number":"146377","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=146377","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/146377/","publication_title":"Proceedings of the First IEEE Conference on Visualization: Visualization `90","conference_location":"San Francisco, CA, USA","conference_dates":"23-26 Oct. 1990","publication_number":311,"is_number":3914,"publication_year":1990,"publication_date":"23-26 Oct. 1990","start_page":"150","end_page":"159","citing_paper_count":21,"citing_patent_count":5,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Sea surface","Data visualization","High performance computing","Biomedical imaging","Graphics","Hardware","Distributed computing","Ray tracing","Algorithm design and analysis"]}},"isbn_formats":{"isbns":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-2083-8","isbnType":"Historical"}]}},{"doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1990.146352","title":"Proceedings of the First IEEE Conference on Visualization.
