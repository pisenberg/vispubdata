"The simulation of breaking of waves, the formation of thin spray sheets, and the entertainment of air around the next generation of naval surface combatants is an ongoing 3-year Department of Defense (DoD) Challenge Project. The goal of this project is a validated computation capability to model the full hydrodynamics around a surface combatant including all of the processes that affect mission and performance. Visualization of these large-scale simulations is paramount to understanding the complex physics involved. These simulations produce enormous data sets with both surface and volumetric qualities. Wave breaking, spray sheets, and air entertainment can be visualized using isosurfaces of scalar data. Visualization of quantities such as the vorticity field also provides insight into the dynamics of droplet and bubble formation. This paper documents the techniques used, results obtained, and lessons learned from the visualization of the hydrodynamics of naval vessels.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250419/","LOCKED","1250419","ERDC, Major Shared Resource Center, Vicksburg, MS, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37297590400","1","P.

"In this paper a new quadric-based view-dependent simplification scheme is presented. The scheme provides a method to connect mesh simplification controlled by a quadric error metric with a level-of-detail hierarchy that is accessed continuously and efficiently based on current view parameters. A variety of methods for determining the screen-space metric for the view calculation are implemented and evaluated, including an appearance-preserving method that has both geometry- and texture-preserving aspects. Results are presented and compared for a variety of models.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250409/","LOCKED","1250409","GVU Center, Georgia Inst. of Technol., Atlanta, Georgia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38197765400","1","J.

"In the traditional volume visualization paradigm, the user specifies a transfer function that assigns each scalar value to a color and opacity by defining an opacity and a color map function. The transfer function has two limitations. First, the user must define curves based on histogram and value rather than seeing and working with the volume itself. Second, the transfer function is inflexible in classifying regions of interest, where values at a voxel such as intensity and gradient are used to differentiate material, not talking into account additional properties such as texture and position. We describe an intuitive user interface for specifying the classification functions that consists of the users painting directly on sample slices of the volume. These painted regions are used to automatically define high-dimensional classification functions that can be implemented in hardware for interactive rendering. The classification of the volume is iteratively improved as the user paints samples, allowing intuitive and efficient viewing of materials of interest.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250413/","LOCKED","1250413","Dept. of Comput.

"We present a hardware-accelerated method for visualizing 3D flow fields. The method is based on insertion, advection, and decay of dye. To this aim, we extend the texture-based IBFV technique presented by van Wijk (2001) for 2D flow visualization in two main directions. First, we decompose the 3D flow visualization problem in a series of 2D instances of the mentioned IBFV technique. This makes our method benefit from the hardware acceleration the original IBFV technique introduced. Secondly, we extend the concept of advected gray value (or color) noise by introducing opacity (or matter) noise. This allows us to produce sparse 3D noise pattern advections, thus address the occlusion problem inherent to 3D flow visualization. Overall, the presented method delivers interactively animated 3D flow, uses only standard OpenGL 1.1 calls and 2D textures, and is simple to understand and implement.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250377/","LOCKED","1250377","Dept. of Math. & Comput.

"We present a haptic rendering technique that uses directional constraints to facilitate enhanced exploration modes for volumetric datasets. The algorithm restricts user motion in certain directions by incrementally moving a proxy point along the axes of a local reference frame. Reaction forces are generated by a spring coupler between the proxy and the data probe, which can be tuned to the capabilities of the haptic interface. Secondary haptic effects including field forces, friction, and texture can be easily incorporated to convey information about additional characteristics of the data. We illustrate the technique with two examples: displaying fiber orientation in heart muscle layers and exploring diffusion tensor fiber tracts in brain white matter tissue. Initial evaluation of the approach indicates that haptic constraints provide an intuitive means or displaying directional information in volume data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250381/","LOCKED","1250381","Sci.

"The Internet pervades many aspects of our lives and is becoming indispensable to critical functions in areas such as commerce, government, production and general information dissemination. To maintain the stability and efficiency of the Internet, every effort must be made to protect it against various forms of attacks, malicious users, and errors. A key component in the Internet security effort is the routine examination of Internet routing data, which unfortunately can be too large and complicated to browse directly. We have developed an interactive visualization process which proves to be very effective for the analysis of Internet routing data. In this application paper, we show how each step in the visualization process helps direct the analysis and glean insights from the data. These insights include the discovery of patterns, detection of faults and abnormal events, understanding of event correlations, formation of causation hypotheses, and classification of anomalies. We also discuss lessons learned in our visual analysis study.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250415/","LOCKED","1250415","Dept. of Comput.

"We introduce a new method for visualizing symmetric tensor fields. The technique produces images and animations reminiscent of line integral convolution (LIC). The technique is also slightly related to hyperstreamlines in that it is used to visualize tensor fields. However, the similarity ends there. HyperLIC uses a multi-pass approach to show the anisotropic properties in a 2D or 3D tensor field. We demonstrate this technique using data sets from computational fluid dynamics as well as diffusion-tensor MRI.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250379/","LOCKED","1250379","Comput. Sci.

"Weather visualization is a difficult problem because it comprises volumetric multi-field data and traditional surface-based approaches obscure details of the complex three-dimensional structure of cloud dynamics. Therefore, visually accurate volumetric multi-field visualization of storm scale and cloud scale data is needed to effectively and efficiently communicate vital information to weather forecasters, improving storm forecasting, atmospheric dynamics models, and weather spotter training. We have developed a new approach to multi-field visualization that uses field specific, physically-based opacity, transmission, and lighting calculations per-field for the accurate visualization of storm and cloud scale weather data. Our approach extends traditional transfer function approaches to multi-field data and to volumetric illumination and scattering.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250383/","LOCKED","1250383","Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37552979700","1","K.

"Simulation of rigid body dynamics has been a field of active research for quite some time. However, the presentation of simulation results has received far less attention so far. We present an interactive and intuitive 3D visualization framework for rigid body simulation data. We introduce various glyphs representing vector attributes such as force and velocity as well as angular attributes including angular velocity and torque. We have integrated our visualization method into an application developed at one of the leading companies in automotive engine design and simulation.

"In this paper, we describe a set of 3D and 4D visualization tools and techniques for CORIE, a complex environmental observation and forecasting system (EOFS) for the Columbia River. The Columbia River, a complex and highly variable estuary, is the target of numerous cross-disciplinary ecosystem research projects and is at the heart of multiple sustainable development issues with long reaching implications for the Pacific Northwest. However, there has been until recently no comprehensive and objective system available for modeling this environment, and as a consequence, researchers and agencies have had inadequate tools for evaluating the effects of natural resource management decisions. CORIE was designed to address this gap and is a major step towards the vision of a scalable, multi-use, real-time EOFS. Although CORIE already had a rich set of visualization tools, most of them produced 2D visualizations and did not allow for interactive visualization. Our work adds advanced interactive 3D tools to CORIE, which can be used for further inspection of the simulated and measured data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250421/","LOCKED","1250421","OGI Sch. of Sci. & Eng., Oregon Health & Sci.

"A survey of graphics developers on the issue of texture mapping hardware for volume rendering would most likely find that the vast majority of them view limited texture memory as one of the most serious drawbacks of an otherwise fine technology. In this paper, we propose a compression scheme for static and time-varying volumetric data sets based on vector quantization that allows us to circumvent this limitation. We describe a hierarchical quantization scheme that is based on a multiresolution covariance analysis of the original field. This allows for the efficient encoding of large-scale data sets, yet providing a mechanism to exploit temporal coherence in non-stationary fields. We show, that decoding and rendering the compressed data stream can be done on the graphics chip using programmable hardware. In this way, data transfer between the CPU and the graphics processing unit (GPU) can be minimized thus enabling flexible and memory efficient real-time rendering options. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by demonstrating interactive renditions of Gigabyte data sets at reasonable fidelity on commodity graphics hardware.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250385/","LOCKED","1250385","Comput.

"A new method was developed to increase the saliency of changing variables in a cardiovascular visualization for use by anesthesiologists in the operating room (OR). Clinically meaningful changes in patient physiology were identified and then mapped to the inherent psychophysical properties of the visualization. A long history of psychophysical research has provided an understanding of the parameters within which the human information processing system is able to detect changes in the size, shape and color of visual objects (Gescheider, 1976, Spence, 1990, and Baird, 1970). These detection thresholds are known as just noticeable differences (JNDs) which characterize the amount of change in an object's attribute that is recognizable 50% of the time. A prototype version of the display has been demonstrated to facilitate anesthesiologist's performance while reducing cognitive workload during simulated cardiac events (Agutter et al., 2002). In order to further improve the utility of the new cardiovascular visualization, the clinically relevant changes in cardiovascular variables are mapped to noticeable perceptual changes in the representational elements of the display. The results of the method described in this paper are used to merge information from the psychophysical properties of the cardiovascular visualization, with clinically relevant changes in the patient's cardiovascular physiology as measured by the clinical meaningfulness questionnaire. The result of this combination will create a visualization that is sensitive to changes in the cardiovascular health of the patient and communicates this information to the user in a meaningful, salient and intuitive manner.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250352/","LOCKED","1250352","Appl.

"Non-linear filtering is an important task for volume analysis. This paper presents hardware-based implementations of various non-linear filters for volume smoothing with edge preservation. The Cg high-level shading language is used in combination with latest PC consumer graphics hardware. Filtering is divided into pervertex and per-fragment stages. In both stages we propose techniques to increase the filtering performance. The vertex program pre-computes texture coordinates in order to address all contributing input samples of the operator mask. Thus additional computations are avoided in the fragment program. The presented fragment programs preserve cache coherence, exploit 4D vector arithmetic, and internal fixed point arithmetic to increase performance. We show the applicability of non-linear filters as part of a GPU-based segmentation pipeline. The resulting binary mask is compressed and decompressed in the graphics memory on-the-fly.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250387/","LOCKED","1250387","Inst. of Comput.

"Visibility culling has the potential to accelerate large data visualization in significant ways. Unfortunately, existing algorithms do not scale well when parallelized, and require full re-computation whenever the opacity transfer function is modified. To address these issues, we have designed a Plenoptic Opacity Function (POF) scheme to encode the view-dependent opacity of a volume block. POFs are computed off-line during a pre-processing stage, only once for each block. We show that using POFs is (i) an efficient, conservative and effective way to encode the opacity variations of a volume block for a range of views, (ii) flexible for re-use by a family of opacity transfer functions without the need for additional off-line processing, and (iii) highly scalable for use in massively parallel implementations. Our results confirm the efficacy of POFs for visibility culling in large-scale parallel volume rendering; we can interactively render the Visible Woman dataset using software ray-casting on 32 processors, with interactive modification of the opacity transfer function on-the-fly.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250391/","LOCKED","1250391","Ohio State Univ., USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279695300","1","Jinzhu Gao","37279695300","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37281262900","2","Jian Huang","37281262900","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279493500","3","Han-Wei Shen","37279493500","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282739200","4","J.A.

"We describe how to count the cases that arise in a family of visualization techniques, including marching cubes, sweeping simplices, contour meshing, interval volumes, and separating surfaces. Counting the cases is the first step toward developing a generic visualization algorithm to produce substitopes (geometric substitution of polytopes). We demonstrate the method using a software system (""GAP"") for computational group theory. The case-counts are organized into a table that provides taxonomy of members of the family; numbers in the table are derived from actual lists of cases, which are computed by our methods. The calculation confirms previously reported case-counts for large dimensions that are too large to check by hand, and predicts the number of cases that will arise in algorithms that have not yet been invented.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250354/","LOCKED","1250354","Florida State Univ., Gainesville, FL, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37356983700","1","D.C.

"We present a method to represent unstructured scalar fields at multiple levels of detail. Using a parallelizable classification algorithm to build a cluster hierarchy, we generate a multiresolution representation of a given volumetric scalar data set. The method uses principal component analysis (PCA) for cluster generation and a fitting technique based on radial basis functions (RBFs). Once the cluster hierarchy has been generated, we utilize a variety of techniques for extracting different levels of detail. The main strength of this work is its generality. Regardless of grid type, this method can be applied to any discrete scalar field representation, even one given as a ""point cloud"".","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250389/","LOCKED","1250389","Dept. of Comput.

"We present improved subdivision and isosurface reconstruction algorithms for polygonizing implicit surfaces and performing accurate geometric operations. Our improved reconstruction algorithm uses directed distance fields (Kobbelt et al., 2001) to detect multiple intersections along an edge, separates them into components and reconstructs an isosurface locally within each components using the dual contouring algorithm (Ju et al., 2002). It can reconstruct thin features without creating handles and results in improved surface extraction from volumetric data. Our subdivision algorithm takes into account sharp features that arise from intersecting surfaces or Boolean operations and generates an adaptive grid such that each voxel has at most one sharp feature. The subdivision algorithm is combined with our improved reconstruction algorithm to compute accurate polygonization of Boolean combinations or offsets of complex primitives that faithfully reconstruct the sharp features. We have applied these algorithms to polygonize complex CAD models designed using thousands of Boolean operations on curved primitives.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250360/","LOCKED","1250360","North Carolina Univ., Chapel Hill, NC, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267825100","1","G.

"LightKit is a system for lighting three-dimensional synthetic scenes. LightKit simplifies the task of producing visually pleasing, easily interpretable images for visualization while making it harder to produce results where the scene illumination distracts from the visualization process. LightKit is based on lighting designs developed by artists and photographers and shown in previous studies to enhance shape perception. A key light provides natural overhead illumination of the scene, augmented by fill, head, and back lights. By default, lights are attached to a normalized, subject-centric, camera-relative coordinate frame to ensure consistent lighting independent of camera location or orientation. This system allows all lights to be positioned by specifying just six parameters. The intensity of each light is specified as a ratio to the key light intensity, allowing the scene's brightness to be adjusted using a single parameter. The color of each light is specified by a single normalized color parameter called warmth that is based on color temperature of natural sources. LightKit's default values for light position, intensity, and color are chosen to produce good results for a variety of scenes. LightKit is designed to work with both hardware graphics systems and, potentially, higher quality off-line rendering systems. We provide examples of images created using a LightKit implementation within the VTK visualization toolkit software framework.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250395/","LOCKED","1250395","Harvard Med.

"This paper presents a signed distance transform algorithm using graphics hardware, which computes the scalar valued function of the Euclidean distance to a given manifold of co-dimension one. If the manifold is closed and orientable, the distance has a negative sign on one side of the manifold and a positive sign on the other. Triangle meshes are considered for the representation of a two-dimensional manifold and the distance function is sampled on a regular Cartesian grid. In order to achieve linear complexity in the number of grid points, to each primitive we assign a simple polyhedron enclosing its Voronoi cell. Voronoi cells are known to contain exactly all points that lay closest to its corresponding primitive. Thus, the distance to the primitive only has to be computed for grid points inside its polyhedron. Although Voronoi cells partition space, the polyhedrons enclosing these cells do overlap. In regions where these overlaps occur, the minimum of all computed distances is assigned to a grid point. In order to speed up computations, points inside each polyhedron are determined by scan conversion of grid slices using graphics hardware. For this task, a fragment program is used to perform the nonlinear interpolation and minimization of distance values.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250358/","LOCKED","1250358","Dept. of Comput.

"In this paper we offer several new insights and techniques for effectively using color and texture to simultaneously convey information about multiple 2D scalar and vector distributions, in a way that facilitates allowing each distribution to be understood both individually and in the context of one or more of the other distributions. Specifically, we introduce the concepts of: color weaving for simultaneously representing information about multiple co-located color encoded distributions; and texture stitching for achieving more spatially accurate multi-frequency line integral convolution representations of combined scalar and vector distributions. The target application for our research is the definition, detection and visualization of regions of interest in a turbulent boundary layer flow at moderate Reynolds number. In this work, we examine and analyze streamwise-spanwise planes of three-component velocity vectors with the goal of identifying and characterizing spatially organized packets of hairpin vortices.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250362/","LOCKED","1250362","Dept. of Comput.

"The quality of volume visualization depends strongly on the quality of the underlying data. In virtual colonoscopy, CT data should be acquired at a low radiation dose that results in a low signal-to-noise ratio. Alternatively, MRI data is acquired without ionizing radiation, but suffers from noise and bias (global signal fluctuations). Current volume visualization techniques often do not produce good results with noisy or biased data. This paper describes methods for volume visualization that deal with these imperfections. The techniques are based on specially adapted edge detectors using first and second order derivative filters. The filtering is integrated into the visualization process. The first order derivative method results in good quality images but suffers from localization bias. The second order method has better surface localization, especially in highly curved areas. It guarantees minimal detail smoothing resulting in a better visualization of polyps.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250397/","LOCKED","1250397","Comput.

"Many traditional techniques for ""looking inside"" volumetric data involve removing portions of the data, for example using various cutting tools, to reveal the interior. This allows the user to see hidden parts of the data, but has the disadvantage of removing potentially important surrounding contextual information. We explore an alternate strategy for browsing that uses deformations, where the user can cut into and open up, spread apart, or peel away parts of the volume in real time, making the interior visible while still retaining surrounding context. We consider various deformation strategies and present a number of interaction techniques based on different metaphors. Our designs pay special attention to the semantic layers that might compose a volume (e.g. the skin, muscle, bone in a scan of a human). Users can apply deformations to only selected layers, or apply a given deformation to a different degree to each layer, making browsing more flexible and facilitating the visualization of relationships between layers. Our interaction techniques are controlled with direct, ""in place"" manipulation, using pop-up menus and 3D widgets, to avoid the divided attention and awkwardness that would come with panels of traditional widgets. Initial user feedback indicates that our techniques are valuable, especially for showing portions of the data spatially situated in context with surrounding data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250400/","LOCKED","1250400","Dept. of Comput.

"We present a technique for direct visualization of unsteady flow on surfaces from computational fluid dynamics. The method generates dense representations of time-dependent vector fields with high spatio-temporal correlation using both Lagrangian-Eulerian advection and image based flow visualization as its foundation. While the 3D vector fields are associated with arbitrary triangular surface meshes, the generation and advection of texture properties is confined to image space. Frame rates of up to 20 frames per second are realized by exploiting graphics card hardware. We apply this algorithm to unsteady flow on boundary surfaces of, large, complex meshes from computational fluid dynamics composed of more than 250,000 polygons, dynamic meshes with time-dependent geometry and topology, as well as medical data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250364/","LOCKED","1250364","VRVis Res.

"We develop a new approach to reconstruct non-discrete models from gridded volume samples. As a model, we use quadratic trivariate super splines on a uniform tetrahedral partition /spl Delta/. The approximating splines are determined in a natural and completely symmetric way by averaging local data samples, such that appropriate smoothness conditions are automatically satisfied. On each tetra-hedron of /spl Delta/ , the quasi-interpolating spline is a polynomial of total degree two which provides several advantages including efficient computation, evaluation and visualization of the model. We apply Bernstein-Bezier techniques well-known in CAGD to compute and evaluate the trivariate spline and its gradient. With this approach the volume data can be visualized efficiently e.g., with isosurface ray-casting. Along an arbitrary ray the splines are univariate, piecewise quadratics and thus the exact intersection for a prescribed isovalue can be easily determined in an analytic and exact way. Our results confirm the efficiency of the quasi-interpolating method and demonstrate high visual quality for rendered isosurfaces.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250399/","LOCKED","1250399","Max-Planck-Inst. fur Informatik, Saarbrucken, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266876100","1","C.

If we treat the data in this manner, we can apply high dimensional slicing and projection techniques to generate an image hyperplane. The user is provided with an intuitive user interface to specify arbitrary hyperplanes in 4D, which can be displayed with standard volume rendering techniques. From the volume specification, we are able to extract arbitrary hyperslices, combine slices together into a hyperprojection volume, or apply a 4D raycasting method to generate the same results. In combination with appropriate integration operators and transfer functions, we are able to extract and present different space-time features to the user.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250402/","LOCKED","1250402","Ohio State Univ., USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37542815100","1","J.

"Segmentation of the tracheo-bronchial tree of the lungs is notoriously difficult. This is due to the fact that the small size of some of the anatomical structures is subject to partial volume effects. Furthermore, the limited intensity contrast between the participating materials (air, blood, and tissue) increases the segmentation of difficulties. In this paper, we propose a hybrid segmentation method which is based on a pipeline of three segmentation stages to extract the lower airways down to the seventh generation of the bronchi. User interaction is limited to the specification of a seed point inside the easily detectable trachea at the upper end of the lower airways. Similarly, the complementary vascular tree of the lungs can be segmented. Furthermore, we modified our virtual endoscopy system to visualize the vascular and airway system of the lungs along with other features, such as lung tumors.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250370/","LOCKED","1250370","Visual Comput. for Medicine, Eberhard-Karls-Univ.

"Numerical particle simulations and astronomical observations create huge data sets containing uncorrelated 3D points of varying size. These data sets cannot be visualized interactively by simply rendering millions of colored points for each frame. Therefore, in many visualization applications a scalar density corresponding to the point distribution is resampled on a regular grid for direct volume rendering. However, many fine details are usually lost for voxel resolutions which still allow interactive visualization on standard workstations. Since no surface geometry is associated with our data sets, the recently introduced point-based rendering algorithms cannot be applied as well. In this paper we propose to accelerate the visualization of scattered point data by a hierarchical data structure based on a PCA clustering procedure. By traversing this structure for each frame we can trade-off rendering speed vs. image quality. Our scheme also reduces memory consumption by using quantized relative coordinates and it allows for fast sorting of semi-transparent clusters. We analyze various software and hardware implementations of our renderer and demonstrate that we can now visualize data sets with tens of millions of points interactively with sub-pixel screen space error on current PC graphics hardware employing advanced vertex shader functionality.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250404/","LOCKED","1250404","Visualization & Interactive Syst.

"This paper presents an algorithm combining view-dependent rendering and conservative occlusion culling for interactive display of complex environments. A vertex hierarchy of the entire scene is decomposed into a cluster hierarchy through a novel clustering and partitioning algorithm. The cluster hierarchy is then used for view-frustum and occlusion culling. Using hardware accelerated occlusion queries and frame-to-frame coherence, a potentially visible set of clusters is computed. An active vertex front and face list is computed from the visible clusters and rendered using vertex arrays. The integrated algorithm has been implemented on a Pentium IV PC with a NVIDIA GeForce 4 graphics card and applied in two complex environments composed of millions of triangles. The resulting system can render these environments at interactive rates with little loss in image quality and minimal popping artifacts.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250368/","LOCKED","1250368","North Carolina Univ., Chapel Hill, NC, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37066068100","1","Sung-Eui Yoon","37066068100","North Carolina Univ., Chapel Hill, NC, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271825900","2","B.

"The goal of this paper is to define a convolution operation which transfers image processing and pattern matching to vector fields from flow visualization. For this, a multiplication of vectors is necessary. Clifford algebra provides such a multiplication of vectors. We define a Clifford convolution on vector fields with uniform grids. The Clifford convolution works with multivector filter masks. Scalar and vector masks can be easily converted to multivector fields. So, filter masks from image processing on scalar fields can be applied as well as vector and scalar masks. Furthermore, a method for pattern matching with Clifford convolution on vector fields is described. The method is independent of the direction of the structures. This provides an automatic approach to feature detection. The features can be visualized using any known method like glyphs, isosurfaces or streamlines. The features are defined by filter masks instead of analytical properties and thus the approach is more intuitive.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250372/","LOCKED","1250372","Kaiserslautern, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37425394400","1","J.

"In this paper a novel volume-rendering technique based on Monte Carlo integration is presented. As a result of a preprocessing, a point cloud of random samples is generated using a normalized continuous reconstruction of the volume as a probability density function. This point cloud is projected onto the image plane, and to each pixel an intensity value is assigned which is proportional to the number of samples projected onto the corresponding pixel area. In such a way a simulated X-ray image of the volume can be obtained. Theoretically, for a fixed image resolution, there exists an M number of samples such that the average standard deviation of the estimated pixel intensities us under the level of quantization error regardless of the number of voxels. Therefore Monte Carlo Volume Rendering (MCVR) is mainly proposed to efficiently visualize large volume data sets. Furthermore, network applications are also supported, since the trade-off between image quality and interactivity can be adapted to the bandwidth of the client/server connection by using progressive refinement.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250406/","LOCKED","1250406","Dept. of Control Eng. & Inf.

"We present a new algorithm for simplifying the shape of 3D objects by manipulating their medial axis transform (MAT). From an unorganized set of boundary points, our algorithm computes the MAT, decomposes the axis into parts, then selectively removes a subset of these parts in order to reduce the complexity of the overall shape. The result is simplified MAT that can be used for a variety of shape operations. In addition, a polygonal surface of the resulting shape can be directly generated from the filtered MAT using a robust surface reconstruction method. The algorithm presented is shown to have a number of advantages over other existing approaches.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250410/","LOCKED","1250410","Dept. of Comput.

"Tracking and visualizing local features from a time-varying volumetric data allows the user to focus on selected regions of interest, both in space and time, which can lead to a better understanding of the underlying dynamics. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm to track time-varying isosurfaces and interval volumes using isosurfacing in higher dimensions. Instead of extracting the data features such as isosurfaces or interval volumes separately from multiple time steps and computing the spatial correspondence between those features, our algorithm extracts the correspondence directly from the higher dimensional geometry and thus can more efficiently follow the user selected local features in time. In addition, by analyzing the resulting higher dimensional geometry, it becomes easier to detect important topological events and the corresponding critical time steps for the selected features. With our algorithm, the user can interact with the underlying time-varying data more easily. The computation cost for performing time-varying volume tracking is also minimized.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250374/","LOCKED","1250374","Dept. of Comput. & Inf.

"In this paper we show how out-of-core mesh processing techniques can be adapted to perform their computations based on the new processing sequence paradigm (Isenburg, et al., 2003), using mesh simplification as an example. We believe that this processing concept will also prove useful for other tasks, such a parameterization, remeshing, or smoothing, for which currently only in-core solutions exist. A processing sequence represents a mesh as a particular interleaved ordering of indexed triangles and vertices. This representation allows streaming very large meshes through main memory while maintaining information about the visitation status of edges and vertices. At any time, only a small portion of the mesh is kept in-core, with the bulk of the mesh data residing on disk. Mesh access is restricted to a fixed traversal order, but full connectivity and geometry information is available for the active elements of the traversal. This provides seamless and highly efficient out-of-core access to very large meshes for algorithms that can adapt their computations to this fixed ordering. The two abstractions that are naturally supported by this representation are boundary-based and buffer-based processing. We illustrate both abstractions by adapting two different simplification methods to perform their computation using a prototype of our mesh processing sequence API. Both algorithms benefit from using processing sequences in terms of improved quality, more efficient execution, and smaller memory footprints.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250408/","LOCKED","1250408","North Carolina Univ., Chapel Hill, NC, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37281897600","1","M.

"Volume rendering is a flexible technique for visualizing dense 3D volumetric datasets. A central element of volume rendering is the conversion between data values and observable quantities such as color and opacity. This process is usually realized through the use of transfer functions that are precomputed and stored in lookup tables. For multidimensional transfer functions applied to multivariate data, these lookup tables become prohibitively large. We propose the direct evaluation of a particular type of transfer functions based on a sum of Gaussians. Because of their simple form (in terms of number of parameters), these functions and their analytic integrals along line segments can be evaluated efficiently on current graphics hardware, obviating the need for precomputed lookup tables. We have adopted these transfer functions because they are well suited for classification based on a unique combination of multiple data values that localize features in the transfer function domain. We apply this technique to the visualization of several multivariate datasets (CT, cryosection) that are difficult to classify and render accurately at interactive rates using traditional approaches.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250412/","LOCKED","1250412","Inst. of Sci.

"One of the reasons that topological methods have a limited popularity for the visualization of complex 3D flow fields is the fact that such topological structures contain a number of separating stream surfaces. Since these stream surfaces tend to hide each other as well as other topological features, for complex 3D topologies the visualizations become cluttered and hardly interpretable. This paper proposes to use particular stream lines called saddle connectors instead of separating stream surfaces and to depict single surfaces only on user demand. We discuss properties and computational issues of saddle connectors and apply these methods to complex flow data. We show that the use of saddle connectors makes topological skeletons available as a valuable visualization tool even for topologically complex 3D flow data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250376/","LOCKED","1250376","MPI Informatik Saarbrucken, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266875400","1","H.

"In this paper, we propose a quasi-static approximation (QSA) approach to simulate the movement of the movable object in 6-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) haptic rendering. In our QSA approach, we solve for static equilibrium during each haptic time step, ignoring any dynamical properties such as inertia. The major contribution of this approach is to overcome the computational instability problem in overly stiff systems arising from numerical integration of second-order differential equations in previous dynamic models. Our primary experimental results on both simulated aircraft geometry and a large-scale real-world aircraft engine showed that our QSA approach was capable of maintaining the 1000Hz haptic refresh rate with more robust collision avoidance and more reliable force and torque feedback.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250380/","LOCKED","1250380","The Boeing Co., Seattle, WA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37362958300","1","Ming Wan","37362958300","The Boeing Co., Seattle, WA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37619958500","2","W.A.

"Direct volume rendering of scalar fields uses a transfer function to map locally measured data properties to opacities and colors. The domain of the transfer function is typically the one-dimensional space of scalar data values. This paper advances the use of curvature information in multi-dimensional transfer functions, with a methodology for computing high-quality curvature measurements. The proposed methodology combines an implicit formulation of curvature with convolution-based reconstruction of the field. We give concrete guidelines for implementing the methodology, and illustrate the importance of choosing accurate filters for computing derivatives with convolution. Curvature-based transfer functions are shown to extend the expressivity and utility of volume rendering through contributions in three different application areas: nonphotorealistic volume rendering, surface smoothing via anisotropic diffusion, and visualization of isosurface uncertainty.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250414/","LOCKED","1250414","Inst. of Sci.

"In this paper we present an interactive texture-based technique for visualizing three-dimensional vector fields. The goal of the algorithm is to provide a general volume rendering framework allowing the user to compute three-dimensional flow textures interactively, and to modify the appearance of the visualization on the fly. To achieve our goal, we decouple the visualization pipeline into two disjoint stages. First, streamlines are generated from the 3D vector data. Various geometric properties of the streamlines are extracted and converted into a volumetric form using a hardware-assisted slice sweeping algorithm. In the second phase of the algorithm, the attributes stored in the volume are used as texture coordinates to look up an appearance texture to generate both informative and aesthetic representations of the underlying vector field. Users can change the input textures and instantaneously visualize the rendering results. With our algorithm, visualizations with enhanced structural perception using various visual cues can be rendered in real time. A myriad of existing geometry-based and texture-based visualization techniques can also be emulated.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250378/","LOCKED","1250378","Dept. of Comput. & Inf.

"We introduce a method for the animation of fire propagation and the burning consumption of objects represented as volumetric data sets. Our method uses a volumetric fire propagation model based on an enhanced distance field. It can simulate the spreading of multiple fire fronts over a specified isosurface without actually having to create that isosurface. The distance field is generated from a specific shell volume that rapidly creates narrow spatial bands around the virtual surface of any given isovalue. The complete distance field is then obtained by propagation from the initial bands. At each step multiple fire fronts can evolve simultaneously on the volumetric object. The flames of the fire are constructed from streams of particles whose movement is regulated by a velocity field generated with the hardware-accelerated Lattice Boltzmann Model (LBM). The LBM provides a physically-based simulation of the air flow around the burning object. The object voxels and the splats associated with the flame particles are rendered in the same pipeline so that the volume data with its external and internal structures can be displayed along with the fire.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250382/","LOCKED","1250382","Center for Visual Comput., Stony Brook Univ., NY, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37067591000","1","Ye Zhao","37067591000","Center for Visual Comput., Stony Brook Univ., NY, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279025800","2","Xiaoming Wei","37279025800","Center for Visual Comput., Stony Brook Univ., NY, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273608100","3","Zhe Fan","37273608100","Center for Visual Comput., Stony Brook Univ., NY, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268052800","4","A.

"We describe a visualization application intended for operational use in formulating business strategy in the customer service arena. The visualization capability provided in this application implicitly allows the user to better formulate the objective function for large optimization runs which act to minimize costs based on certain input parameters. Visualization is necessary because many of the inputs to the optimization runs are themselves strategic business decisions which are not pre-ordained. Both information visualization presentations and three-dimensional visualizations are included to help users better understand the cost/benefit tradeoffs of these strategic business decisions. Here, visualization explicitly provides value not possible algorithmically, as the perceived benefit of different combinations of service level does not have an a priori mathematical formulation. Thus, we take advantage of the fundamental power of visualization, bringing the user's intuition and pattern recognition skills into the solution, while simultaneously taking advantage of the strength of algorithmic approaches to quickly and accurately find an optimal solution to a well-defined problem.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250416/","LOCKED","1250416","IBM T.J.

"We present techniques for discovering and exploiting regularity in large curvilinear data sets. The data can be based on a single mesh or a mesh composed of multiple submeshes (also known as zones). Multi-zone data are typical in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Regularities include axis-aligned rectilinear and cylindrical meshes as well as cases where one zone is equivalent to a rigid body transformation of another. Our algorithms can also discover rigid-body motion of meshes in time-series data. Next, we describe a data model where we can utilize the results from the discovery process in order to accelerate large data visualizations. Where possible, we replace general curvilinear zones with rectilinear or cylindrical zones. In rigid-body motion cases, we replace a time-series of meshes with a transformed mesh object where a reference mesh is dynamically transformed based on a given time value in order to satisfy geometry requests, on demand. The data model enables us to make these substitutions and dynamic transformations transparently with respect to the visualization algorithms. We present results with large data sets where we combine our mesh replacement and transformation techniques with out-of-core paging in order to achieve analysis speedups ranging from 1.5 to 2.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250420/","LOCKED","1250420","Adv.

"Nowadays, direct volume rendering via 3D textures has positioned itself as an efficient tool for the display and visual analysis of volumetric scalar fields. It is commonly accepted, that for reasonably sized data sets appropriate quality at interactive rates can be achieved by means of this technique. However, despite these benefits one important issue has received little attention throughout the ongoing discussion of texture based volume rendering: the integration of acceleration techniques to reduce per-fragment operations. In this paper, we address the integration of early ray termination and empty-space skipping into texture based volume rendering on graphical processing units (GPU). Therefore, we describe volume ray-casting on programmable graphics hardware as an alternative to object-order approaches. We exploit the early z-test to terminate fragment processing once sufficient opacity has been accumulated, and to skip empty space along the rays of sight. We demonstrate performance gains up to a factor of 3 for typical renditions of volumetric data sets on the ATI 9700 graphics card.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250384/","LOCKED","1250384","Comput.

"The extraction of planar sections from volume images is the most commonly used technique for inspecting and visualizing anatomic structures. We propose to generalize the concept of planar section to the extraction of curved cross-sections (free form surfaces). Compared with planar slices, curved cross-sections may easily follow the trajectory of tubular structures and organs such as the aorta or the colon. They may be extracted from a 3D volume, displayed as a 3D view and possibly flattened. Flattening of curved cross-sections allows to inspect spatially complex relationship between anatomic structures and their neighborhood. They also allow to carry out measurements along a specific orientation. For the purpose of facilitating the interactive specification of free form surfaces, users may navigate in real time within the body and select the slices on which the surface control points will be positioned. Immediate feedback is provided by displaying boundary curves as cylindrical markers within a 3D view composed of anatomic organs, planar slices and possibly free form surface sections. Extraction of curved surface sections is an additional service that is available online as a Java applet (http://visiblehuman.epfl.ch). It may be used as an advanced tool for exploring and teaching anatomy.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250351/","LOCKED","1250351","Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Switzerland","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37563163700","1","L.

"This paper describes a set of techniques developed for the visualization of high-resolution volume data generated from industrial computed tomography for nondestructive testing (NDT) applications. Because the data are typically noisy and contain fine features, direct volume rendering methods do not always give us satisfactory results. We have coupled region growing techniques and a 2D histogram interface to facilitate volumetric feature extraction. The new interface allows the user to conveniently identify, separate or composite, and compare features in the data. To lower the cost of segmentation, we show how partial region growing results can suggest a reasonably good classification function for the rendering of the whole volume. The NDT applications that we work on demand visualization tasks including not only feature extraction and visual inspection, but also modeling and measurement of concealed structures in volumetric objects. An efficient filtering and modeling process for generating surface representation of extracted features is also introduced. Four CT data sets for preliminary NDT are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new visualization strategy that we have developed.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250418/","LOCKED","1250418","California Univ., Davis, CA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37288597500","1","R.

"This paper describes the work of a team of researchers in computer graphics, geometric computing, and civil engineering to produce a visualization of the September 2001 attack on the Pentagon. The immediate motivation for the project was to understand the behavior of the building under the impact. The longer term motivation was to establish a path for producing high-quality visualizations of large scale simulations. The first challenge was managing the enormous complexity of the scene to fit within the limits of state-of-the art simulation software systems and supercomputing resources. The second challenge was to integrate the simulation results into a high-quality visualization. To meet this challenge, we implemented a custom importer that simplifies and loads the massive simulation data in a commercial animation system. The surrounding scene is modeled using image-based techniques and is also imported in the animation system where the visualization is produced. A specific issue for us was to federate the simulation and the animation systems, both commercial systems not under our control and following internally different conceptualizations of geometry and animation. This had to be done such that scalability was achieved. The reusable link created between the two systems allows communicating the results to non-specialists and the public at large, as well as facilitating communication in teams with members having diverse technical backgrounds.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250422/","LOCKED","1250422","Purdue Univ., USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272425500","1","V.

"One of the most important goals in volume rendering is to be able to visually separate and selectively enable specific objects of interest contained in a single volumetric data set, which can be approached by using explicit segmentation information. We show how segmented data sets can be rendered interactively on current consumer graphics hardware with high image quality and pixel-resolution filtering of object boundaries. In order to enhance object perception, we employ different levels of object distinction. First, each object can be assigned an individual transfer function, multiple of which can be applied in a single rendering pass. Second, different rendering modes such as direct volume rendering, iso-surfacing, and non-photorealistic techniques can be selected for each object. A minimal number of rendering passes is achieved by processing sets of objects that share the same rendering mode in a single pass. Third, local compositing modes such as alpha blending and MIP can be selected for each object in addition to a single global mode, thus enabling high-quality two-level volume rendering on GPUs.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250386/","LOCKED","1250386","VRVis Res.

"We present the first implementation of a volume ray casting algorithm for tetrahedral meshes running on off-the-shelf programmable graphics hardware. Our implementation avoids the memory transfer bottleneck of the graphics bus since the complete mesh data is stored in the local memory of the graphics adapter and all computations, in particular ray traversal and ray integration, are performed by the graphics processing unit. Analogously to other ray casting algorithms, our algorithm does not require an expensive cell sorting. Provided that the graphics adapter offers enough texture memory, our implementation performs comparable to the fastest published volume rendering algorithms for unstructured meshes. Our approach works with cyclic and/or non-convex meshes and supports early ray termination. Accurate ray integration is guaranteed by applying pre-integrated volume rendering. In order to achieve almost interactive modifications of transfer functions, we propose a new method for computing three-dimensional pre-integration tables.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250390/","LOCKED","1250390","Visualization & Interactive Syst.

"Traditional volume visualization techniques may provide incomplete clinical information needed for applications in medical visualization. In the area of vascular visualization important features such as the lumen of a diseased vessel segment may not be visible. Curved planar reformation (CPR) has proven to be an acceptable practical solution. Existing CPR techniques, however, still have diagnostically relevant limitations. In this paper, we introduce two advances methods for efficient vessel visualization, based on the concept of CPR. Both methods benefit from relaxation of spatial coherence in favor of improved feature perception. We present a new technique to visualize the interior of a vessel in a single image. A vessel is resampled along a spiral around its central axis. The helical spiral depicts the vessel volume. Furthermore, a method to display an entire vascular tree without mutually occluding vessels is presented. Minimal rotations at the bifurcations avoid occlusions. For each viewing direction the entire vessel structure is visible.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250353/","LOCKED","1250353","Inst. of Comput.

"We propose methods to accelerate texture-based volume rendering by skipping invisible voxels. We partition the volume into sub-volumes, each containing voxels with similar properties. Sub-volumes composed of only voxels mapped to empty by the transfer function are skipped. To render the adaptively partitioned sub-volumes in visibility order, we reorganize them into an orthogonal BSP tree. We also present an algorithm that computes incrementally the intersection of the volume with the slicing planes, which avoids the overhead of the intersection and texture coordinates computation introduced by the partitioning. Rendering with empty space skipping is 2 to 5 times faster than without it. To skip occluded voxels, we introduce the concept of orthogonal opacity map, that simplifies the transformation between the volume coordinates and the opacity map coordinates, which is intensively used for occlusion detection. The map is updated efficiently by the GPU. The sub-volumes are then culled and clipped against the opacity map. We also present a method that adaptively adjusts the optimal number of the opacity map updates. With occlusion clipping, about 60% of non-empty voxels can be skipped and an additional 80% speedup on average is gained for iso-surface-like rendering.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250388/","LOCKED","1250388","Dept. of Comput.

"Hand-crafted illustrations are often more effective than photographs for conveying the shape and important features of an object, but they require expertise and time to produce. We describe an image compositing system and user interface that allow an artist to quickly and easily create technical illustrations from a set of photographs of an object taken from the same point of view under variable lighting conditions. Our system uses a novel compositing process in which images are combined using spatially-varying light mattes, enabling the final lighting in each area of the composite to be manipulated independently. We describe an interface that provides for the painting of local lighting effects (e.g. shadows, highlights, and tangential lighting to reveal texture) directly onto the composite. We survey some of the techniques used in illustration and lighting design to convey the shape and features of objects and describe how our system can be used to apply these techniques.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250392/","LOCKED","1250392","Stanford Univ., USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268691800","1","D.

"We describe a modification of the widely used marching cubes method that leads to the useful property that the resulting isosurfaces are locally single valued functions. This implies that conventional interpolation and approximation methods can be used to locally represent the surface. These representations can be used for computing approximations for local surface properties. We utilize this possibility in order to develop algorithms for locally approximating Gaussian and mean curvature, methods for constrained smoothing of isosurface, and techniques for the parameterization of isosurfaces.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250355/","LOCKED","1250355","Arizona State Univ., Tempe, AZ, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283754100","1","G.M.

"This paper presents a shading model for volumetric data which enhances the perception of surfaces within the volume. The model incorporates uniform diffuse illumination, which arrives equally from all directions at each surface point in the volume. This illumination is attenuated by occlusions in the local vicinity of the surface point, resulting in shadows in depressions and crevices. Experiments by other authors have shown that perception of a surface is superior under uniform diffuse lighting, compared to illumination from point source lighting.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250394/","LOCKED","1250394","Sch. of Comput., Queen's Univ., Kingston, Ont., Canada","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37345685900","1","A.J.

"Deformable isosurfaces, implemented with level-set methods, have demonstrated a great potential in visualization for applications such as segmentation, surface processing, and surface reconstruction. Their usefulness has been limited, however, by their high computational cost and reliance on significant parameter tuning. This paper presents a solution to these challenges by describing graphics processor (GPU) based on algorithms for solving and visualizing level-set solutions at interactive rates. Our efficient GPU-based solution relies on packing the level-set isosurface data into a dynamic, sparse texture format. As the level set moves, this sparse data structure is updated via a novel GPU to CPU message passing scheme. When the level-set solver is integrated with a real-time volume renderer operating on the same packed format, a user can visualize and steer the deformable level-set surface as it evolves. In addition, the resulting isosurface can serve as a region-of-interest specifier for the volume renderer. This paper demonstrates the capabilities of this technology for interactive volume visualization and segmentation.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250357/","LOCKED","1250357","Sch. of Comput. & Imaging Inst., Utah Univ., Salt Lake, UT, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38198885000","1","A.E.

"We propose unsteady flow advection-convolution (UFAC) as a novel visualization approach for unsteady flows. It performs time evolution governed by pathlines, but builds spatial correlation according to instantaneous streamlines whose spatial extent is controlled by the flow unsteadiness. UFAC is derived from a generic framework that provides spacetime-coherent dense representations of time dependent-vector fields by a two-step process: 1) construction of continuous trajectories in spacetime for temporal coherence; and 2) convolution along another set of paths through the above spacetime for spatially correlated patterns. Within the framework, known visualization techniques-such as Lagrangian-Eulerian advection, image-based flow visualization, unsteady flow LIC, and dynamic LIC-can be reproduced, often with better image quality, higher performance, or increased flexibility of the visualization style. Finally, we present a texture-based discretization of the framework and its interactive implementation on graphics hardware, which allows the user to gradually balance visualization speed against quality.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250361/","LOCKED","1250361","Inst. of Visualization & Interactive Syst., Stuttgart Univ., Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268045000","1","D.

"2D and 3D views are used together in many visualization domains, such as medical imaging, flow visualization, oceanographic visualization, and computer aided design (CAD). Combining these views into one display can be done by: (1) orientation icon (i.e., separate windows), (2) in-place methods (e.g., clip and cutting planes), and (3) a new method called ExoVis. How 2D and 3D views are displayed affects ease of mental registration (understanding the spatial relationship between views), an important factor influencing user performance. This paper compares the above methods in terms of their ability to support mental registration. Empirical results show that mental registration is significantly easier with in-place displays than with ExoVis, and significantly easier with ExoVis than with orientation icons. Different mental transformation strategies can explain this result. The results suggest that ExoVis may be a better alternative to orientation icons when in-place displays are not appropriate (e.g., when in-place methods hide data or cut the 3D view into several pieces).","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250396/","LOCKED","1250396","Sch. of Comput.

"This paper addresses the problem of surface reconstruction of highly noisy point clouds. The surfaces to be reconstructed are assumed to be 2-manifolds of piecewise C/sup 1/ continuity, with isolated small irregular regions of high curvature, sophisticated local topology or abrupt burst of noise. At each sample point, a quadric field is locally fitted via a modified moving least squares method. These locally fitted quadric fields are then blended together to produce a pseudo-signed distance field using Shepard's method. We introduce a prioritized front growing scheme in the process of local quadrics fitting. Flatter surface areas tend to grow faster. The already fitted regions will subsequently guide the fitting of those irregular regions in their neighborhood.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250359/","LOCKED","1250359","Dept. of Comput.

"A new method for the synthesis of dense, vector-field aligned textures on curved surfaces is presented, called IBFVS. The method is based on image based flow visualization (IBFV). In IBFV two-dimensional animated textures are produced by defining each frame of a flow animation as a blend between a warped version of the previous image and a number of filtered white noise images. We produce flow aligned texture on arbitrary three-dimensional triangular meshes in the same spirit as the original method: texture is generated directly in image space. We show that IBFVS is efficient and effective. High performance (typically fifty frames or more per second) is achieved by exploiting graphics hardware. Also, IBFVS can easily be implemented and a variety of effects can be achieved. Applications are flow visualization and surface rendering. Specifically, we show how to visualize the wind field on the earth and how to render a dirty bronze bunny.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250363/","LOCKED","1250363","Dept. of Math. & Comput.

"Volume rendering and isosurface extraction from three-dimensional scalar fields are mostly based on piecewise trilinear representations. In regions of high geometric complexity such visualization methods often exhibit artifacts, due to trilinear interpolation. In this work, we present an iterative fairing method for scalar fields interpolating function values associated with grid points while smoothing the contours inside the grid cells based on variational principles. We present a local fairing method providing a piecewise bicubic representation of two-dimensional scalar fields. Our algorithm generalizes to the trivariate case and can be used to increase the resolution of data sets either locally or globally, reducing interpolation artifacts. In contrast to filtering methods, our algorithm does not reduce geometric detail supported by the data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250398/","LOCKED","1250398","Univ. of Kaiserslautern, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282067000","1","M.

In this paper, we present a novel methodology for ""summarizing"" video sequences using volume visualization techniques. We outline a system pipeline for capturing videos, extracting features, volume rendering video and feature data, and creating video visualization. We discuss a collection of image comparison metrics, including the linear dependence detector, for constructing ""relative"" and ""absolute"" difference volumes that represent the magnitude of variation between video frames. We describe the use of a few volume visualization techniques, including volume scene graphs and spatial transfer functions, for creating video visualization. In particular, we present a stream-based technique for processing and directly rendering video data in real time.

"This paper introduces a method for converting an image or volume sampled on a regular grid into a space-efficient irregular point hierarchy. The conversion process retains the original frequency characteristics of the dataset by matching the spatial distribution of sample points with the required frequency. To achieve good blending, the spherical points commonly used in volume rendering are generalized to ellipsoidal point primitives. A family of multiresolution, oriented Gabor wavelets provide the frequency-space analysis of the dataset. The outcome of this frequency analysis is the reduced set of points, in which the sampling rate is decreased in originally oversampled areas. During rendering, the traversal of the hierarchy can be controlled by any suitable error metric or quality criteria. The local level of refinement is also sensitive to the transfer function. Areas with density ranges mapped to high transfer function variability are rendered at higher point resolution than others. Our decomposition is flexible and can be used for iso-surface rendering, alpha compositing and X-ray rendering of volumes. We demonstrate our hierarchy with an interactive splatting volume renderer, in which the traversal of the point hierarchy for rendering is modulated by a user-specified frame rate.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250403/","LOCKED","1250403","Center for Visual Comput., Comput.

"In this paper we present a generic method for incremental mesh adaptation based on hierarchy of semi-regular meshes. Our method supports any refinement rule mapping vertices onto vertices such as 1-to-4 split or /spl radic/3-subdivision. Resulting adaptive mesh has subdivision connectivity and hence good aspect ratio of triangles. Hierarchic representation of the mesh allows incremental local refinement and simplification operations exploiting frame-to-frame coherence. We also present an out-of-core storage layout scheme designed for semi-regular meshes of arbitrary subdivision connectivity. It provides high cache coherency in the data retrieval and relies on the interleaved storage of resolution levels and maintaining good geometrical proximity within each level. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated with applications in physically-based cloth simulation, real-time terrain visualization and procedural modeling.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250367/","LOCKED","1250367","Moscow Inst. of Phys. & Technol., Russia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38198208400","1","V.

"Unstructured meshes are often used in simulations and imaging applications. They provide advanced flexibility in modeling abilities but are more difficult to manipulate and analyze than regular data. This work provides a novel approach for the analysis of unstructured meshes using feature-space clustering and feature-detection. Analyzing and revealing underlying structures in data involve operators on both spatial and functional domains. Slicing concentrates more on the spatial domain, while iso-surfacing or volume rendering concentrate more on the functional domain. Nevertheless, many times it is the combination of the two domains which provides real insight on the structure of the data. In this work, a combined feature-space is defined on top of unstructured meshes in order to search for structure in the data. A point in feature-space includes the spatial coordinates of the point in the mesh domain and all chosen attributes defined on the mesh. A distance measures between points in feature-space is defined enabling the utilization of clustering using the mean shift procedure (previously used for images) on unstructured meshes. Feature space analysis is shown to be useful for feature-extraction, for data exploration and partitioning.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250371/","LOCKED","1250371","The Interdisciplinary Center, Herzliya, Israel","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266753700","1","A.

"We present an innovative modeling and rendering primitive, called the O-buffer, for sample-based graphics, such as images, volumes and points. The 2D or 3D O-buffer is in essence a conventional image or a volume, respectively, except that samples are not restricted to a regular grid. A sample position in the O-buffer is recorded as an offset to the nearest grid point of a regular base grid (hence the name O-buffer). The offset is typically quantized for compact representation and efficient rendering. The O-buffer emancipates pixels and voxels from the regular grids and can greatly improve the modeling power of images and volumes. It is a semi-regular structure which lends itself to efficient construction and rendering. Image quality can be improved by storing more spatial information with samples and by avoiding multiple resamplings and delaying reconstruction to the final rendering stage. Using O-buffers, more accurate multi-resolution representations can be developed for images and volumes. It can also be exploited to represent and render unstructured primitives, such as points, particles, curvilinear or irregular volumes. The O-buffer is therefore a uniform representation for a variety of graphics primitives and supports mixing them in the same scene. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the O-buffer with hierarchical O-buffers, layered depth O-buffers, and hybrid volume rendering with O-buffers.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250405/","LOCKED","1250405","Dept. of Comput.

"Segmentation of structures from measured volume data, such as anatomy in medical imaging, is a challenging data-dependent task. In this paper, we present a segmentation method that leverages the parallel processing capabilities of modern programmable graphics hardware in order to run significantly faster than previous methods. In addition, collocating the algorithm computation with the visualization on the graphics hardware circumvents the need to transfer data across the system bus, allowing for faster visualization and interaction. This algorithm is unique in that it utilizes sophisticated graphics hardware functionality (i.e., floating point precision, render to texture, computational masking, and fragment programs) to enable fast segmentation and interactive visualization.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250369/","LOCKED","1250369","Stanford Univ., CA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282594600","1","A.

"In this paper, we present a space efficient algorithm for speeding up isosurface extraction. Even though there exist algorithms that can achieve optimal search performance to identify isosurface cells, they prove impractical for large datasets due to a high storage overhead. With the dual goals of achieving fast isosurface extraction and simultaneously reducing the space requirement, we introduce an algorithm based on transform coding to compress the interval information of the cells in a dataset. Compression is achieved by first transforming the cell intervals (minima, maxima) into a form which allows more efficient compaction. It is followed by a dataset optimized non-uniform quantization stage. The compressed data is stored in a data structure that allows fast searches in the compression domain, thus eliminating the need to retrieve the original representation of the intervals at run-time. The space requirement of our search data structure is the mandatory cost of storing every cell ID once, plus an overhead for quantization information. The overhead is typically in the order of a few hundredths of the dataset size.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250373/","LOCKED","1250373","Dept. of Comput. & Inf.

"In this paper we propose a new method for the creation of normal maps for recovering the detail on simplified meshes and a set of objective techniques to metrically evaluate the quality of different recovering techniques. The proposed techniques, that automatically produces a normal-map texture for a simple 3D model that ""imitates"" the high frequency detail originally present in a second, much higher resolution one, is based on the computation of per-texel visibility and self-occlusion information. This information is used to define a point-to-point correspondence between simplified and hires meshes. Moreover, we introduce a number of criteria for measuring the quality (visual or otherwise) of a given mapping method, and provide efficient algorithms to implement them. Lastly, we apply them to rate different mapping methods, including the widely used ones and the new one proposed here.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250407/","LOCKED","1250407","ISTI, CNR, Pisa, Italy","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591264000","1","M.

"While there are a couple of transfer function design approaches for CT and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) data, direct volume rendering of ultrasound data still relies on manual adjustment of an inflexible piecewise linear opacity transfer function (OTF) on a trial-and-error basis. The main challenge of automatically designing an OTF for visualization of sonographic data is the low signal-to-noise ratio in combination with real time data acquisition at frame rates up to 25 volumes per second. In this paper, we present an efficient solution of this task. Our approach is based on the evaluation of tube cores, i.e., collections of voxels gathered by traversing the volume in rendering directions. We use information about the probable position of an interface between tissues of different echogenicity to adaptively design an OTF in a multiplicative way. We show the appropriateness of our approach by examples, deliberately on data sets of moderate quality arising frequently in clinical settings.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250411/","LOCKED","1250411","Adv.

"In this paper, we propose a novel out-of-core isosurface extraction technique for large time-varying fields over irregular grids. We employ our meta-cell technique to explore the spatial coherence of the data, and our time tree algorithm to consider the temporal coherence as well. Our one-time preprocessing phase first partitions the dataset into meta-cells that cluster spatially neighboring cells together and are stored in disk. We then build a time tree to index the meta-cells for fast isosurface extraction. The time tree takes advantage of the temporal coherence among the scalar values at different time steps, and uses BBIO trees as secondary structures, which are stored in disk and support I/O-optimal interval searches. The time tree algorithm employs a novel meta-interval collapsing scheme and the buffer technique, to take care of the temporal coherence in an I/O-efficient way. We further make the time tree cache-oblivious, so that searching on it automatically performs optimal number of block transfers between any two consecutive levels of memory hierarchy (such as between cache and main memory and between main memory and disk) simultaneously. At run-time, we perform optimal cache-oblivious searches in the time tree, together with I/O-optimal searches in the BBIO trees, to read the active meta-cells from disk and generate the queried isosurface efficiently. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our new technique. In particular, compared with the query-optimal main-memory algorithm by Cignoni et al. (1997) (extended for time-varying fields) when there is not enough main memory, our technique can speed up the isosurface queries from more than 18 hours to less than 4 minutes.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1250375/","LOCKED","1250375","Dept. of Comput. & Inf.
