"New product development involves people with different backgrounds. Designers, engineers, and consumers all have different design criteria, and these criteria interact. Early concepts evolve in this kind of collaborative context, and there is a need for dynamic visualization of the interaction between design shape and other shape-related design criteria. In this paper, a morphable model is defined from simplified representations of suitably chosen real cars, providing a continuous shape space to navigate, manipulate and visualize. Physical properties and consumer-provided scores for the real cars (such as 'weight' and 'sportiness') are estimated for new designs across the shape space. This coupling allows one to manipulate the shape directly while reviewing the impact on estimated criteria, or conversely, to manipulate the criterial values of the current design to produce a new shape with more desirable attributes.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376186/","LOCKED","4376186","GM R&D","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37280035100","1","Randall Smith","37280035100","GM R&D","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282920800","2","Richard Pawlicki","37282920800","University of Basel","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945249900","3","István Kókai","37945249900","University of Basel","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37956948500","4","Jörg Finger","37956948500","University of Basel","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37281818300","5","Thomas Vetter","37281818300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","21","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70581","1559","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=4376186","Morphable model","shape space","barycentric coordinates","design space.","","","","","","","Navigation","Visualization","Solid modeling","Shape measurement","Product development","Humans","Face","Linear regression","Fingers","Design engineering","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376186","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","1","1552","Navigating in a Shape Space of Registered Models","13"
"We present a new approach for real-time sound rendering in complex, virtual scenes with dynamic sources and objects. Our approach combines the efficiency of interactive ray tracing with the accuracy of tracing a volumetric representation. We use a four-sided convex frustum and perform clipping and intersection tests using ray packet tracing. A simple and efficient formulation is used to compute secondary frusta and perform hierarchical traversal. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in an interactive system for complex environments and architectural models with tens or hundreds of thousands of triangles. Our algorithm can perform real-time simulation and rendering on a high-end PC.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376201/","LOCKED","4376201","Department of Computer Science, Campus Box 3175, Sitterson Hall, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606258500","1","Christian Lauterbach","37606258500","Department of Computer Science, Campus Box 3175, Sitterson Hall, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37883391100","2","Anish Chandak","37883391100","Department of Computer Science, Campus Box 3175, Sitterson Hall, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267825600","3","Dinesh Manocha","37267825600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","25","8","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70567","1679","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376201/","Acoustic propagation","Ray tracing","","","","","","","","","Layout","Rendering (computer graphics)","Ray tracing","Computational modeling","Hardware","Acceleration","Data visualization","Optical reflection","Acoustic reflection","Acoustic beams","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376201","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","2","1672","Interactive sound rendering in complex and dynamic scenes using frustum tracing","13"
"Modern unsteady (multi-)field visualizations require an effective reduction of the data to be displayed. From a huge amount of information the most informative parts have to be extracted. Instead of the fuzzy application dependent notion of feature, a new approach based on information theoretic concepts is introduced in this paper to detect important regions. This is accomplished by extending the concept of local statistical complexity from finite state cellular automata to discretized (multi-)fields. Thus, informative parts of the data can be highlighted in an application-independent, purely mathematical sense. The new measure can be applied to unsteady multifields on regular grids in any application domain. The ability to detect and visualize important parts is demonstrated using diffusion, flow, and weather simulations.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376165/","LOCKED","4376165","University of Leipzig, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37393638200","1","Heike Janicke","37393638200","University of Leipzig, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37565763400","2","Alexander Wiebel","37565763400","University of Leipzig, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282574800","3","Gerik Scheuermann","37282574800","University of California, Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37722986700","4","Wolfgang Kollmann","37722986700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","33","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70615","1391","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376165/","Local statistical complexity","multifield visualization","time-dependent","coherent structures","feature detection","information theory","flow visualization","","","","Data visualization","Computer vision","Biological system modeling","Computational modeling","Data mining","Information theory","Computational fluid dynamics","Electromagnetic fields","Electromagnetic modeling","Biological systems","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376165","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","3","1384","Multifield visualization using local statistical complexity","13"

We describe design guidelines for adding visual cues to common user interface widgets such as radio buttons, sliders, and combo boxes and contribute a general software framework for applying scented widgets within applications with minimal modifications to existing source code. We provide a number of example applications and describe a controlled experiment which finds that users exploring unfamiliar data make up to twice as many unique discoveries using widgets imbued with social navigation data.

"Just as we can work with two-dimensional floor plans to communicate 3D architectural design, we can exploit reduced- dimension shadows to manipulate the higher-dimensional objects generating the shadows. In particular, by taking advantage of physically reactive 3D shadow-space controllers, we can transform the task of interacting with 4D objects to a new level of physical reality. We begin with a teaching tool that uses 2D knot diagrams to manipulate the geometry of 3D mathematical knots via their projections; our unique 2D haptic interface allows the user to become familiar with sketching, editing, exploration, and manipulation of 3D knots rendered as projected images on a 2D shadow space. By combining graphics and collision-sensing haptics, we can enhance the 2D shadow-driven editing protocol to successfully leverage 2D pen-and-paper or blackboard skills. Building on the reduced-dimension 2D editing tool for manipulating 3D shapes, we develop the natural analogy to produce a reduced-dimension 3D tool for manipulating 4D shapes. By physically modeling the correct properties of 4D surfaces, their bending forces, and their collisions in the 3D haptic controller interface, we can support full-featured physical exploration of 4D mathematical objects in a manner that is otherwise far beyond the experience accessible to human beings. As far as we are aware, this paper reports the first interactive system with force-feedback that provides ""4D haptic visualization"" permitting the user to model and interact with 4D cloth-like objects.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376203/","LOCKED","4376203","Computer Science Department, Indiana University, Bloomington.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37559775500","1","Hui Zhang","37559775500","Computer Science Department, Indiana University, Bloomington","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37333439100","2","Andrew Hanson","37333439100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","13","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70593","1695","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376203/","knot theory","haptics","visualization","","","","","","","","Haptic interfaces","Visualization","Shape","Floors","Education","Geometry","Rendering (computer graphics)","Graphics","Protocols","Mathematical model","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376203","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","5","1688","Shadow-Driven 4D Haptic Visualization","13"
"Our ability to generate ever-larger, increasingly-complex data, has established the need for scalable methods that identify, and provide insight into, important variable trends and interactions. Query-driven methods are among the small subset of techniques that are able to address both large and highly complex datasets. This paper presents a new method that increases the utility of query-driven techniques by visually conveying statistical information about the trends that exist between variables in a query. In this method, correlation fields, created between pairs of variables, are used with the cumulative distribution functions of variables expressed in a users query. This integrated use of cumulative distribution functions and correlation fields visually reveals, with respect to the solution space of the query, statistically important interactions between any three variables, and allows for trends between these variables to be readily identified. We demonstrate our method by analyzing interactions between variables in two flame-front simulations.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376167/","LOCKED","4376167","Institute for Data Analysis and Visualization (IDAV), University of California, Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37395482900","1","Luke Gosink","37395482900","Institute for Data Analysis and Visualization (IDAV), University of California, Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403588300","2","John Anderson","37403588300","Computing Sciences Division and Scientific Visualization Group, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38558020600","3","Wes Bethel","38558020600","Institute for Data Analysis and Visualization (IDAV), University of California, Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267811400","4","Kenneth Joy","37267811400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","37","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70519","1407","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376167/","Multivariate Data","Query-Driven Visualization","","","","","","","","","Data visualization","Distribution functions","Fires","Histograms","Analytical models","Throughput","Large-scale systems","Performance analysis","Combustion","Chemicals","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376167","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","6","1400","Variable Interactions in Query-Driven Visualization","13"
"Analysis of the results obtained from material simulations is important in the physical sciences. Our research was motivated by the need to investigate the properties of a simulated porous solid as it is hit by a projectile. This paper describes two techniques for the generation of distance fields containing a minimal number of topological features, and we use them to identify features of the material. We focus on distance fields defined on a volumetric domain considering the distance to a given surface embedded within the domain. Topological features of the field are characterized by its critical points. Our first method begins with a distance field that is computed using a standard approach, and simplifies this field using ideas from Morse theory. We present a procedure for identifying and extracting a feature set through analysis of the MS complex, and apply it to find the invariants in the clean distance field. Our second method proceeds by advancing a front, beginning at the surface, and locally controlling the creation of new critical points. We demonstrate the value of topologically clean distance fields for the analysis of filament structures in porous solids. Our methods produce a curved skeleton representation of the filaments that helps material scientists to perform a detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis of pores, and hence infer important material properties. Furthermore, we provide a set of criteria for finding the ""difference"" between two skeletal structures, and use this to examine how the structure of the porous solid changes over several timesteps in the simulation of the particle impact.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376171/","LOCKED","4376171","Institute for Data Analysis and Visualization, Dept. of Computer Science, University of California, Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37870001700","1","Attila Gyulassy","37870001700","Center for Applied Scientific Computing, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267813100","2","Mark Duchaineau","37267813100","Dept. of Computer Science and Automation, Supercomputer Education and Research Centre, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37278509300","3","Vijay Natarajan","37278509300","Center for Applied Scientific Computing, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284312600","4","Valerio Pascucci","37284312600","Material Science and Technology Division, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37320622500","5","Eduardo Bringa","37320622500","Department of Physics, Clarendon Laboratory, University of Oxford, Oxford","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37848485600","6","Andrew Higginbotham","37848485600","Institute for Data Analysis and Visualization, Dept. of Computer Science, University of California, Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282068700","7","Bernd Hamann","37282068700","","","","","","","","","","","60","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70603","1439","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376171/","Morse theory","Morse-Smale complex","distance field","topological simplification","wavefront","critical point","porous solid","material science","","","Laboratories","Solid modeling","Computer science","Projectiles","Materials science and technology","Data analysis","Data visualization","Scientific computing","Analytical models","Feature extraction","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376171","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","7","1432","Topologically Clean Distance Fields","13"
"Information visualization has often focused on providing deep insight for expert user populations and on techniques for amplifying cognition through complicated interactive visual models. This paper proposes a new subdomain for infovis research that complements the focus on analytic tasks and expert use. Instead of work-related and analytically driven infovis, we propose casual information visualization (or casual infovis) as a complement to more traditional infovis domains. Traditional infovis systems, techniques, and methods do not easily lend themselves to the broad range of user populations, from expert to novices, or from work tasks to more everyday situations. We propose definitions, perspectives, and research directions for further investigations of this emerging subfield. These perspectives build from ambient information visualization (Skog et al., 2003), social visualization, and also from artistic work that visualizes information (Viegas and Wattenberg, 2007). We seek to provide a perspective on infovis that integrates these research agendas under a coherent vocabulary and framework for design. We enumerate the following contributions. First, we demonstrate how blurry the boundary of infovis is by examining systems that exhibit many of the putative properties of infovis systems, but perhaps would not be considered so. Second, we explore the notion of insight and how, instead of a monolithic definition of insight, there may be multiple types, each with particular characteristics. Third, we discuss design challenges for systems intended for casual audiences. Finally we conclude with challenges for system evaluation in this emerging subfield.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376134/","LOCKED","4376134","School of Interactive Computing and the GVU Center at the Georgia Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945316800","1","Zachary Pousman","37945316800","School of Interactive Computing and the GVU Center at the Georgia Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267736900","2","John Stasko","37267736900","University of California, Santa Cruz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37329261300","3","Michael Mateas","37329261300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","145","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70541","1152","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376134/","Casual information visualization","ambient infovis","social infovis","editorial","design","evaluation.","","","","","Data visualization","Information analysis","Cognition","Focusing","Vocabulary","Finance","Government","Refining","Testing","Technology management","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376134","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","8","1145","Casual Information Visualization: Depictions of Data in Everyday Life","13"
"This paper describes a method for constructing isosurface triangulations of sampled, volumetric, three-dimensional scalar fields. The resulting meshes consist of triangles that are of consistently high quality, making them well suited for accurate interpolation of scalar and vector-valued quantities, as required for numerous applications in visualization and numerical simulation. The proposed method does not rely on a local construction or adjustment of triangles as is done, for instance, in advancing wavefront or adaptive refinement methods. Instead, a system of dynamic particles optimally samples an implicit function such that the particles' relative positions can produce a topologically correct Delaunay triangulation. Thus, the proposed method relies on a global placement of triangle vertices. The main contributions of the paper are the integration of dynamic particles systems with surface sampling theory and PDE-based methods for controlling the local variability of particle densities, as well as detailing a practical method that accommodates Delaunay sampling requirements to generate sparse sets of points for the production of high-quality tessellations.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376205/","LOCKED","4376205","Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute at the University of Utah,","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564728700","1","Miriah Meyer","37564728700","Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute at the University of Utah,","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275716100","2","Robert M.

"Scientific visualization and illustration tools are designed to help people understand the structure and complexity of scientific data with images that are as informative and intuitive as possible. In this context the use of metaphors plays an important role since they make complex information easily accessible by using commonly known concepts. In this paper we propose a new metaphor, called ""topological landscapes,"" which facilitates understanding the topological structure of scalar functions. The basic idea is to construct a terrain with the same topology as a given dataset and to display the terrain as an easily understood representation of the actual input data. In this projection from an n-dimensional scalar function to a two-dimensional (2D) model we preserve function values of critical points, the persistence (function span) of topological features, and one possible additional metric property (in our examples volume). By displaying this topologically equivalent landscape together with the original data we harness the natural human proficiency in understanding terrain topography and make complex topological information easily accessible.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376169/","LOCKED","4376169","Computational Research Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, 1 Cyclotron Road, Berkeley, CA-94720","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37411444100","1","Gunther Weber","37411444100","Center for Applied Scientific Computing, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Box 808, L-551, Livermore, CA 94551","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564112000","2","Peer-Timo Bremer","37564112000","Center for Applied Scientific Computing, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Box 808, L-551, Livermore, CA 94551","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284312600","3","Valerio Pascucci","37284312600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","63","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70601","1423","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376169/","Feature Detection (primary keyword)","User Interfaces","Visual Analytics","Contour Tree","Terrain","Topology","SOAR","","","","Data visualization","Topology","Histograms","Isosurfaces","Laboratories","Two dimensional displays","Humans","Surfaces","Computer vision","User interfaces","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376169","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","10","1416","Topological Landscapes: A Terrain Metaphor for Scientific Data","13"
"Most streamline generation algorithms either provide a particular density of streamlines across the domain or explicitly detect features, such as critical points, and follow customized rules to emphasize those features. However, the former generally includes many redundant streamlines, and the latter requires Boolean decisions on which points are features (and may thus suffer from robustness problems for real-world data). We take a new approach to adaptive streamline placement for steady vector fields in 2D and 3D. We define a metric for local similarity among streamlines and use this metric to grow streamlines from a dense set of candidate seed points. The metric considers not only Euclidean distance, but also a simple statistical measure of shape and directional similarity. Without explicit feature detection, our method produces streamlines that naturally accentuate regions of geometric interest. In conjunction with this method, we also propose a quantitative error metric for evaluating a streamline representation based on how well it preserves the information from the original vector field. This error metric reconstructs a vector field from points on the streamline representation and computes a difference of the reconstruction from the original vector field.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376173/","LOCKED","4376173","Johns Hopkins University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37965943900","1","Yuan Chen","37965943900","Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275763600","2","Jonathan Cohen","37275763600","Johns Hopkins University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37955208400","3","Julian Krolik","37955208400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","46","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70595","1455","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376173/","Adaptive streamlines","vector field reconstruction","shape matching","","","","","","","","Computer vision","Robustness","Euclidean distance","Shape measurement","Magnetic fields","Convolution","Magnetohydrodynamics","Extraterrestrial measurements","Magnetic field measurement","Magnetic properties","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376173","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","11","1448","Similarity-Guided Streamline Placement with Error Evaluation","13"
"The technology available to building designers now makes it possible to monitor buildings on a very large scale. Video cameras and motion sensors are commonplace in practically every office space, and are slowly making their way into living spaces. The application of such technologies, in particular video cameras, while improving security, also violates privacy. On the other hand, motion sensors, while being privacy-conscious, typically do not provide enough information for a human operator to maintain the same degree of awareness about the space that can be achieved by using video cameras. We propose a novel approach in which we use a large number of simple motion sensors and a small set of video cameras to monitor a large office space. In our system we deployed 215 motion sensors and six video cameras to monitor the 3,000-square-meter office space occupied by 80 people for a period of about one year. The main problem in operating such systems is finding a way to present this highly multidimensional data, which includes both spatial and temporal components, to a human operator to allow browsing and searching recorded data in an efficient and intuitive way. In this paper we present our experiences and the solutions that we have developed in the course of our work on the system. We consider this work to be the first step in helping designers and managers of building systems gain access to information about occupants' behavior in the context of an entire building in a way that is only minimally intrusive to the occupants' privacy.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376136/","LOCKED","4376136","Mitsubuishi Electric Research Labs","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37610396000","1","Yuri Ivanov","37610396000","Mitsubuishi Electric Research Labs","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37269410400","2","Christopher Wren","37269410400","UIUC","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37408858200","3","Alexander Sorokin","37408858200","MIT Media Lab","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37952472500","4","Ishwinder Kaur","37952472500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","36","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70621","1160","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376136/","Sensor networks","user interfaces","surveillance","timeline","spatio-temporal visualization","","","","","","Visualization","History","Space technology","Cameras","Buildings","Monitoring","Privacy","Humans","Large-scale systems","Information security","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376136","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","12","1153","Visualizing the History of Living Spaces","13"

VisLink readily generalizes to support multiple visualizations, empowers inter-representational queries, and enables the reuse of the spatial variables, thus supporting efficient information encoding and providing for powerful visualization bridging. Our approach uses multiple 2D layouts, drawing each one in its own plane. These planes can then be placed and re-positioned in 3D space: side by side, in parallel, or in chosen placements that provide favoured views.

"We have combined methods from volume visualization and data analysis to support better diagnosis and treatment of human retinal diseases. Many diseases can be identified by abnormalities in the thicknesses of various retinal layers captured using optical coherence tomography (OCT). We used a support vector machine (SVM) to perform semi-automatic segmentation of retinal layers for subsequent analysis including a comparison of layer thicknesses to known healthy parameters. We have extended and generalized an older SVM approach to support better performance in a clinical setting through performance enhancements and graceful handling of inherent noise in OCT data by considering statistical characteristics at multiple levels of resolution. The addition of the multi-resolution hierarchy extends the SVM to have ""global awareness"". A feature, such as a retinal layer, can therefore be modeled within the SVM as a combination of statistical characteristics across all levels; thus capturing high- and low-frequency information. We have compared our semi-automatically generated segmentations to manually segmented layers for verification purposes. Our main goals were to provide a tool that could (i) be used in a clinical setting; (ii) operate on noisy OCT data; and (iii) isolate individual or multiple retinal layers in both healthy and disease cases that contain structural deformities.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376207/","LOCKED","4376207","Univ. of California at Davis, Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37953777500","1","Alfred Fuller","37953777500","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945292600","2","Robert Zawadzki","37945292600","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37964205700","3","Stacey Choi","37964205700","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282066500","4","David Wiley","37282066500","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37950733300","5","John Werner","37950733300","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282068700","6","Bernd Hamann","37282068700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","53","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70590","1726","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=4376207","support vector machine","segmentation","image analysis","retinal","optical coherence tomography","volume visualization","image processing.","","","","Image segmentation","Retina","Support vector machines","Diseases","Data visualization","Data analysis","Humans","Tomography","Performance analysis","Noise level","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376207","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","14","1719","Segmentation of Three-dimensional Retinal Image Data","13"
"Physics-based flow visualization techniques seek to mimic laboratory flow visualization methods with virtual analogues. In this work we describe the rendering of a virtual rheoscopic fluid to produce images with results strikingly similar to laboratory experiments with real-world rheoscopic fluids using products such as Kalliroscope. These fluid additives consist of microscopic, anisotropic particles which, when suspended in the flow, align with both the flow velocity and the local shear to produce high-quality depictions of complex flow structures. Our virtual rheoscopic fluid is produced by defining a closed-form formula for the orientation of shear layers in the flow and using this orientation to volume render the flow as a material with anisotropic reflectance and transparency. Examples are presented for natural convection, thermocapillary convection, and Taylor-Couette flow simulations. The latter agree well with photographs of experimental results of Taylor-Couette flows from the literature.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376211/","LOCKED","4376211","Texas Advanced Computing Center","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37943750000","1","William Barth","37943750000","Texas Advanced Computing Center","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37967296500","2","Christopher Burns","37967296500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70610","1758","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376211/","Flow visualization","rheoscopic fluids.","","","","","","","","","Visualization","Laboratories","Rendering (computer graphics)","Additives","Microscopy","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Computer vision","Reflectivity","Computational modeling","Surface texture","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376211","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","15","1751","Virtual Rheoscopic Fluids for Flow Visualization","13"
"The recently introduced notion of Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent to characterize Coherent Lagrangian Structures provides a powerful framework for the visualization and analysis of complex technical flows. Its definition is simple and intuitive, and it has a deep theoretical foundation. While the application of this approach seems straightforward in theory, the associated computational cost is essentially prohibitive. Due to the Lagrangian nature of this technique, a huge number of particle paths must be computed to fill the space-time flow domain. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for the adaptive computation of FTLE fields in two and three dimensions that significantly reduces the number of required particle paths. Furthermore, for three-dimensional flows, we show on several examples that meaningful results can be obtained by restricting the analysis to a well-chosen plane intersecting the flow domain. Finally, we examine some of the visualization aspects of FTLE-based methods and introduce several new variations that help in the analysis of specific aspects of a flow.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376175/","LOCKED","4376175","University of Kaiserslautern, Germany, and the Institute for Data Analysis and Visualization at University of California, Davis,","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282573700","1","Christoph Garth","37282573700","University of Kaiserslautern, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37645639800","2","Florian Gerhardt","37645639800","SCI Institute, University of Utah, and Purdue University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282575100","3","Xavier Tricoche","37282575100","University of Kaiserslautern, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088033885","4","Hagen Hans","37088033885","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","121","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70551","1471","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376175/","flow visualization","feature detection","3D vector field visualization","","","","","","","","Visualization","Fluid flow","Lagrangian functions","Computational efficiency","Automotive engineering","Data analysis","Performance analysis","Computer vision","Object detection","Biomedical engineering","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376175","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","16","1464","Efficient Computation and Visualization of Coherent Structures in Fluid Flow Applications","13"
"Exploratory visual analysis is useful for the preliminary investigation of large structured, multifaceted spatio-temporal datasets. This process requires the selection and aggregation of records by time, space and attribute, the ability to transform data and the flexibility to apply appropriate visual encodings and interactions. We propose an approach inspired by geographical 'mashups' in which freely-available functionality and data are loosely but flexibly combined using de facto exchange standards. Our case study combines MySQL, PHP and the LandSerf GIS to allow Google Earth to be used for visual synthesis and interaction with encodings described in KML. This approach is applied to the exploration of a log of 1.42 million requests made of a mobile directory service. Novel combinations of interaction and visual encoding are developed including spatial 'tag clouds', 'tag maps', 'data dials' and multi-scale density surfaces. Four aspects of the approach are informally evaluated: the visual encodings employed, their success in the visual exploration of the dataset, the specific tools used and the 'mashup' approach. Preliminary findings will be beneficial to others considering using mashups for visualization. The specific techniques developed may be more widely applied to offer insights into the structure of multifarious spatio-temporal data of the type explored here.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376138/","LOCKED","4376138","giCentre, Department of Information Science, City University, London","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399045100","1","Jo Wood","37399045100","giCentre, Department of Information Science, City University, London","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37605079900","2","Jason Dykes","37605079900","giCentre, Department of Information Science, City University, London","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590960700","3","Aidan Slingsby","37590960700","Department of Geography, UC Santa Barbara","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37548107100","4","Keith Clarke","37548107100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","117","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70570","1183","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376138/","Large dataset visualization","text and document visualization","multiresolution visualization","geographic visualization","applications of infovis.","","","","","","Reflection","Mashups","Encoding","Data visualization","Geographic Information Systems","Earth","Application software","Spatial resolution","Data mining","Filters","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376138","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","17","1176","Interactive Visual Exploration of a Large Spatio-temporal Dataset: Reflections on a Geovisualization Mashup.","13"
"Documents and other categorical valued time series are often characterized by the frequencies of short range sequential patterns such as n-grams. This representation converts sequential data of varying lengths to high dimensional histogram vectors which are easily modeled by standard statistical models. Unfortunately, the histogram representation ignores most of the medium and long range sequential dependencies making it unsuitable for visualizing sequential data. We present a novel framework for sequential visualization of discrete categorical time series based on the idea of local statistical modeling. The framework embeds categorical time series as smooth curves in the multinomial simplex summarizing the progression of sequential trends. We discuss several visualization techniques based on the above framework and demonstrate their usefulness for document visualization.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376142/","LOCKED","4376142","Purdue Univ., West Lafayette","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37957484800","1","Yi Mao","37957484800","Purdue Univ., West Lafayette","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37954686000","2","Joshua Dillon","37954686000","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37427770800","3","Guy Lebanon","37427770800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70592","1215","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376142/","Document visualization","multi-resolution analysis","local fitting.","","","","","","","","Histograms","Data visualization","Frequency","Proteins","Principal component analysis","Statistics","Time series analysis","Amino acids","Multidimensional systems","","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376142","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","18","1208","Sequential Document Visualization","13"
"We present a method to extract and visualize vortices that originate from bounding walls of three-dimensional time- dependent flows. These vortices can be detected using their footprint on the boundary, which consists of critical points in the wall shear stress vector field. In order to follow these critical points and detect their transformations, affected regions of the surface are parameterized. Thus, an existing singularity tracking algorithm devised for planar settings can be applied. The trajectories of the singularities are used as a basis for seeding particles. This leads to a new type of streak line visualization, in which particles are released from a moving source. These generalized streak lines visualize the particles that are ejected from the wall. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method on several transient fluid flow datasets from computational fluid dynamics simulations.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376209/","LOCKED","4376209","Univ.

"In this paper we present a method to compute and visualize volumetric white matter connectivity in diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) using a Hamilton-Jacobi (H-J) solver on the GPU (graphics processing unit). Paths through the volume are assigned costs that are lower if they are consistent with the preferred diffusion directions. The proposed method finds a set of voxels in the DTI volume that contain paths between two regions whose costs are within a threshold of the optimal path. The result is a volumetric optimal path analysis, which is driven by clinical and scientific questions relating to the connectivity between various known anatomical regions of the brain. To solve the minimal path problem quickly, we introduce a novel numerical algorithm for solving H-J equations, which we call the fast iterative method (FIM). This algorithm is well-adapted to parallel architectures, and we present a GPU-based implementation, which runs roughly 50-100 times faster than traditional CPU-based solvers for anisotropic H-J equations. The proposed system allows users to freely change the endpoints of interesting pathways and to visualize the optimal volumetric path between them at an interactive rate. We demonstrate the proposed method on some synthetic and real DT-MRI datasets and compare the performance with existing methods.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376177/","LOCKED","4376177","Scientiﬁc Computing and Imaging Institute, School of Computing, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268212100","1","Won-Ki Jeong","37268212100","Scientiﬁc Computing and Imaging Institute, School of Computing, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37830031800","2","P.

"We propose a novel, geometrically adaptive method for surface reconstruction from noisy and sparse point clouds, without orientation information. The method employs a fast convection algorithm to attract the evolving surface towards the data points. The force field in which the surface is convected is based on generalized Coulomb potentials evaluated on an adaptive grid (i.e., an octree) using a fast, hierarchical algorithm. Formulating reconstruction as a convection problem in a velocity field generated by Coulomb potentials offers a number of advantages. Unlike methods which compute the distance from the data set to the implicit surface, which are sensitive to noise due to the very reliance on the distance transform, our method is highly resilient to shot noise since global, generalized Coulomb potentials can be used to disregard the presence of outliers due to noise. Coulomb potentials represent long-range interactions that consider all data points at once, and thus they convey global information which is crucial in the fitting process. Both the spatial and temporal complexities of our spatially-adaptive method are proportional to the size of the reconstructed object, which makes our method compare favorably with respect to previous approaches in terms of speed and flexibility. Experiments with sparse as well as noisy data sets show that the method is capable of delivering crisp and detailed yet smooth surfaces.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376181/","LOCKED","4376181","Institute for Mathematics and Computing Science, University of Groningen, The Netherlands","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279264300","1","Andrei C.

"Even though interaction is an important part of information visualization (Infovis), it has garnered a relatively low level of attention from the Infovis community. A few frameworks and taxonomies of Infovis interaction techniques exist, but they typically focus on low-level operations and do not address the variety of benefits interaction provides. After conducting an extensive review of Infovis systems and their interactive capabilities, we propose seven general categories of interaction techniques widely used in Infovis: 1) Select, 2) Explore, 3) Reconfigure, 4) Encode, 5) Abstract/Elaborate, 6) Filter, and 7) Connect. These categories are organized around a user's intent while interacting with a system rather than the low-level interaction techniques provided by a system. The categories can act as a framework to help discuss and evaluate interaction techniques and hopefully lay an initial foundation toward a deeper understanding and a science of interaction.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376144/","LOCKED","4376144","Health Systems Institute & H.

"Topological methods give concise and expressive visual representations of flow fields. The present work suggests a comparable method for the visualization of human brain diffusion MRI data. We explore existing techniques for the topological analysis of generic tensor fields, but find them inappropriate for diffusion MRI data. Thus, we propose a novel approach that considers the asymptotic behavior of a probabilistic fiber tracking method and define analogs of the basic concepts of flow topology, like critical points, basins, and faces, with interpretations in terms of brain anatomy. The resulting features are fuzzy, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in any connectivity estimate from diffusion imaging. We describe an algorithm to extract the new type of features, demonstrate its robustness under noise, and present results for two regions in a diffusion MRI dataset to illustrate that the method allows a meaningful visual analysis of probabilistic fiber tracking results.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376179/","LOCKED","4376179","MPI Inf., Saarbrucken","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606352800","1","Thomas Schultz","37606352800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266875400","2","Holger Theisel","37266875400","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271851300","3","Hans-Peter Seidel","37271851300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","37","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70602","1503","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376179/","Diffusion tensor","probabilistic fiber tracking","tensor topology","uncertainty visualization.","","","","","","","Data visualization","Magnetic resonance imaging","Humans","Tensile stress","Topology","Brain","Anatomy","Uncertainty","Noise robustness","Algorithm design and analysis","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376179","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","23","1496","Topological Visualization of Brain Diffusion MRI Data","13"
"We present a method for extracting boundary surfaces from segmented cross-section image data. We use a constrained Potts model to interpolate an arbitrary number of region boundaries between segmented images. This produces a segmented volume from which we extract a triangulated boundary surface using well-known marching tetrahedra methods. This surface contains staircase-like artifacts and an abundance of unnecessary triangles. We describe an approach that addresses these problems with a voxel-accurate simplification algorithm that reduces surface complexity by an order of magnitude. Our boundary interpolation and simplification methods are novel contributions to the study of surface extraction from segmented cross-sections. We have applied our method to construct polycrystal grain boundary surfaces from micrographs of a sample of the metal tantalum.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376183/","LOCKED","4376183","Institute for Data Analysis and Visualization (IDAV), University of California, Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945275200","1","Scott Dillard","37945275200","Materials Science and Technology Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37377270300","2","John Bingert","37377270300","Materials Design Institute, Los Alamos National Laboratory","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37305284400","3","Dan Thoma","37305284400","Institute for Data Analysis and Visualization (IDAV), and the Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282068700","4","Bernd Hamann","37282068700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","17","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70543","1535","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376183/","Surface extraction","Polygonal meshes","Visualization in Physical Sciences","Life Sciences and Engineering","","","","","","","Surface morphology","Grain boundaries","Image segmentation","Data mining","Data visualization","Crystalline materials","Computer graphics","Application software","Materials science and technology","Data analysis","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376183","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","24","1528","Construction of Simplified Boundary Surfaces from Serial-sectioned Metal Micrographs","13"

"In many applications, it is important to understand the individual values of, and relationships between, multiple related scalar variables defined across a common domain. Several approaches have been proposed for representing data in these situations. In this paper we focus on strategies for the visualization of multivariate data that rely on color mixing. In particular, through a series of controlled observer experiments, we seek to establish a fundamental understanding of the information-carrying capacities of two alternative methods for encoding multivariate information using color: color blending and color weaving. We begin with a baseline experiment in which we assess participants' abilities to accurately read numerical data encoded in six different basic color scales defined in the L*a*b* color space. We then assess participants' abilities to read combinations of 2, 3, 4 and 6 different data values represented in a common region of the domain, encoded using either color blending or color weaving. In color blending a single mixed color is formed via linear combination of the individual values in L*a*b* space, and in color weaving the original individual colors are displayed side-by-side in a high frequency texture that fills the region. A third experiment was conducted to clarify some of the trends regarding the color contrast and its effect on the magnitude of the error that was observed in the second experiment. The results indicate that when the component colors are represented side-by-side in a high frequency texture, most participants' abilities to infer the values of individual components are significantly improved, relative to when the colors are blended. Participants' performance was significantly better with color weaving particularly when more than 2 colors were used, and even when the individual colors subtended only 3 minutes of visual angle in the texture. However, the information-carrying capacity of the color weaving approach has its limits. We found that participants' abilities to accurately interpret each of the individual components in a high frequency color texture typically falls off as the number of components increases from 4 to 6. We found no significant advantages, in either color blending or color weaving, to using color scales based on component hues thatare more widely separated in the L*a*b* color space. Furthermore, we found some indications that extra difficulties may arise when opponent hues are employed.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376150/","LOCKED","4376150","Boston Scientific","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38335711400","1","Haleh Hagh-Shenas","38335711400","Gettysburg College","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38307086000","2","Sunghee Kim","38307086000","University of Minnesota","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282637800","3","Victoria Interrante","37282637800","North Carolina State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37298406100","4","Christopher Healey","37298406100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","40","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70623","1277","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376150/","Color","perception","visualization","color weaving","color blending.","","","","","","Weaving","Data visualization","Frequency","Color","Encoding","Meteorology","Geology","Astronomy","Displays","","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376150","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","26","1270","Weaving Versus Blending: a quantitative assessment of the information carrying capacities of two alternative methods for conveying multivariate data with color.","13"
"Although real-time interactive volume rendering is available even for very large data sets, this visualization method is used quite rarely in the clinical practice. We suspect this is because it is very complicated and time consuming to adjust the parameters to achieve meaningful results. The clinician has to take care of the appropriate viewpoint, zooming, transfer function setup, clipping planes and other parameters. Because of this, most often only 2D slices of the data set are examined. Our work introduces LiveSync, a new concept to synchronize 2D slice views and volumetric views of medical data sets. Through intuitive picking actions on the slice, the users define the anatomical structures they are interested in. The 3D volumetric view is updated automatically with the goal that the users are provided with expressive result images. To achieve this live synchronization we use a minimal set of derived information without the need for segmented data sets or data-specific pre-computations. The components we consider are the picked point, slice view zoom, patient orientation, viewpoint history, local object shape and visibility. We introduce deformed viewing spheres which encode the viewpoint quality for the components. A combination of these deformed viewing spheres is used to estimate a good viewpoint. Our system provides the physician with synchronized views which help to gain deeper insight into the medical data with minimal user interaction.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376185/","LOCKED","4376185","Vienna Univ. of Technol., Vienna","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37623778100","1","Peter Kohlmann","37623778100","Vienna Univ. of Technol., Vienna","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37265895700","2","Stefan Bruckner","37265895700","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282727500","3","Armin Kanitsar","37282727500","IEEE Computer Society","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282552200","4","Eduard Gröller","37282552200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","23","5","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70576","1551","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376185/","Navigation","interaction","linked views","medical visualization","viewpoint selection.","","","","","","Navigation","Biomedical imaging","Displays","Data visualization","Medical diagnostic imaging","Transfer functions","Anatomical structure","Computed tomography","Image segmentation","History","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376185","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","27","1544","LiveSync: Deformed Viewing Spheres for Knowledge-Based Navigation","13"
"Michotte's theory of ampliation suggests that causal relationships are perceived by objects animated under appropriate spatiotemporal conditions. We extend the theory of ampliation and propose that the immediate perception of complex causal relations is also dependent on a set of structural and temporal rules. We designed animated representations, based on Michotte's rules, for showing complex causal relationships or causal semantics. In this paper we describe a set of animations for showing semantics such as causal amplification, causal strength, causal dampening, and causal multiplicity. In a two part study we compared the effectiveness of both the static and animated representations. The first study (N=44) asked participants to recall passages that were previously displayed using both types of representations. Participants were 8% more accurate in recalling causal semantics when they were presented using animations instead of static graphs. In the second study (N=112) we evaluated the intuitiveness of the representations. Our results showed that while users were as accurate with the static graphs as with the animations, they were 9% faster in matching the correct causal statements in the animated condition. Overall our results show that animated diagrams that are designed based on perceptual rules such as those proposed by Michotte have the potential to facilitate comprehension of complex causal relations.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376148/","LOCKED","4376148","Department of Computer Science, University of Manitoba","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37567251500","1","Nivedita R.

"While the treemap is a popular method for visualizing hierarchical data, it is often difficult for users to track layout and attribute changes when the data evolve over time. When viewing the treemaps side by side or back and forth, there exist several problems that can prevent viewers from performing effective comparisons. Those problems include abrupt layout changes, a lack of prominent visual patterns to represent layouts, and a lack of direct contrast to highlight differences. In this paper, we present strategies to visualize changes of hierarchical data using treemaps. A new treemap layout algorithm is presented to reduce abrupt layout changes and produce consistent visual patterns. Techniques are proposed to effectively visualize the difference and contrast between two treemap snapshots in terms of the map items' colors, sizes, and positions. Experimental data show that our algorithm can achieve a good balance in maintaining a treemap's stability, continuity, readability, and average aspect ratio. A software tool is created to compare treemaps and generate the visualizations. User studies show that the users can better understand the changes in the hierarchy and layout, and more quickly notice the color and size differences using our method.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376152/","LOCKED","4376152","Computer Science and Engineering Department at the Ohio State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37875062100","1","Ying Tu","37875062100","Computer Science and Engineering Department at the Ohio State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279493500","2","Han-Wei Shen","37279493500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","69","6","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70529","1293","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376152/","Treemap","tree comparison","visualize changes","treemap layout algorithm.","","","","","","","Data visualization","Displays","File systems","Switches","Computer science","Data engineering","Stability","Software tools","Data analysis","Spirals","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376152","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","29","1286","Visualizing Changes of Hierarchical Data using Treemaps","13"

"This paper presents a scalable framework for real-time raycasting of large unstructured volumes that employs a hybrid bricking approach. It adaptively combines original unstructured bricks in important (focus) regions, with structured bricks that are resampled on demand in less important (context) regions. The basis of this focus+context approach is interactive specification of a scalar degree of interest (DOI) function. Thus, rendering always considers two volumes simultaneously: a scalar data volume, and the current DOI volume. The crucial problem of visibility sorting is solved by raycasting individual bricks and compositing in visibility order from front to back. In order to minimize visual errors at the grid boundary, it is always rendered accurately, even for resampled bricks. A variety of different rendering modes can be combined, including contour enhancement. A very important property of our approach is that it supports a variety of cell types natively, i.e., it is not constrained to tetrahedral grids, even when interpolation within cells is used. Moreover, our framework can handle multi-variate data, e.g., multiple scalar channels such as temperature or pressure, as well as time-dependent data. The combination of unstructured and structured bricks with different quality characteristics such as the type of interpolation or resampling resolution in conjunction with custom texture memory management yields a very scalable system.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376191/","LOCKED","4376191","VRVis Research Center, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546620600","1","Philipp Muigg","37546620600","VRVis Research Center, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37394809600","2","Markus Hadwiger","37394809600","VRVis Research Center, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546620400","3","Helmut Doleisch","37546620400","University of Bergen, Norway","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274158800","4","Helwig Hauser","37274158800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","16","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70588","1599","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376191/","Volume Rendering of Unstructured Grids","Focus+Context Techniques","Hardware-Assisted Volume Rendering","","","","","","","","Interpolation","Sorting","Computational fluid dynamics","Computational modeling","Grid computing","Temperature","Memory management","Quality management","Finite volume methods","Data visualization","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376191","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","31","1592","Scalable Hybrid Unstructured and Structured Grid Raycasting","13"
"The need to visualize large social networks is growing as hardware capabilities make analyzing large networks feasible and many new data sets become available. Unfortunately, the visualizations in existing systems do not satisfactorily resolve the basic dilemma of being readable both for the global structure of the network and also for detailed analysis of local communities. To address this problem, we present NodeTrix, a hybrid representation for networks that combines the advantages of two traditional representations: node-link diagrams are used to show the global structure of a network, while arbitrary portions of the network can be shown as adjacency matrices to better support the analysis of communities. A key contribution is a set of interaction techniques. These allow analysts to create a NodeTrix visualization by dragging selections to and from node-link and matrix forms, and to flexibly manipulate the NodeTrix representation to explore the dataset and create meaningful summary visualizations of their findings. Finally, we present a case study applying NodeTrix to the analysis of the InfoVis 2004 coauthorship dataset to illustrate the capabilities of NodeTrix as both an exploration tool and an effective means of communicating results.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376154/","LOCKED","4376154","INRIA Futurs/University Paris-Sud, France and University of Sydney, Australia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37839948300","1","Nathalie Henry","37839948300","INRIA Futurs, France","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407972900","2","Jean-Daniel Fekete","37407972900","Ontario Cancer Institute and University of Toronto, Canada","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38526446600","3","Michael J.

"We describe a novel volumetric global illumination framework based on the face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice. An FCC lattice has important advantages over a Cartesian lattice. It has higher packing density in the frequency domain, which translates to better sampling efficiency. Furthermore, it has the maximal possible kissing number (equivalent to the number of nearest neighbors of each site), which provides optimal 3D angular discretization among all lattices. We employ a new two-pass (illumination and rendering) global illumination scheme on an FCC lattice. This scheme exploits the angular discretization to greatly simplify the computation in multiple scattering and to minimize illumination information storage. The GPU has been utilized to further accelerate the rendering stage. We demonstrate our new framework with participating media and volume rendering with multiple scattering, where both are significantly faster than traditional techniques with comparable quality.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376189/","LOCKED","4376189","Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794-4400","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37416126400","1","Feng Qiu","37416126400","Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794-4400","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275296400","2","Fang Xu","37275296400","Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794-4400","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273608100","3","Zhe Fan","37273608100","Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794-4400","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945247700","4","Neophytou Neophytos","37945247700","Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794-4400","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268052800","5","Arie Kaufman","37268052800","Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794-4400","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273119700","6","Klaus Mueller","37273119700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","24","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70573","1583","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376189/","Volume visualization","volume rendering","participating media","lattice","FCC lattice","sampling","multiple scattering","GPU.","","","Lighting","Lattices","Rendering (computer graphics)","Optical scattering","FCC","Light scattering","Particle scattering","Visualization","Vectors","Sampling methods","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376189","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","33","1576","Lattice-Based Volumetric Global Illumination","13"
"In this paper we introduce a visualization technique that provides an abstracted view of the shape and spatio-physico-chemical properties of complex molecules. Unlike existing molecular viewing methods, our approach suppresses small details to facilitate rapid comprehension, yet marks the location of significant features so they remain visible. Our approach uses a combination of filters and mesh restructuring to generate a simplified representation that conveys the overall shape and spatio-physico-chemical properties (e.g. electrostatic charge). Surface markings are then used in the place of important removed details, as well as to supply additional information. These simplified representations are amenable to display using stylized rendering algorithms to further enhance comprehension. Our initial experience suggests that our approach is particularly useful in browsing collections of large molecules and in readily making comparisons between them.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376193/","LOCKED","4376193","Department of Computer Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Madison","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37882969500","1","Gregory Cipriano","37882969500","Department of Computer Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Madison","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282585700","2","Michael Gleicher","37282585700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","26","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70578","1615","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376193/","molecular surfaces","molecular visualization","surfaces","textures","cartographic labeling","","","","","","Shape","Visualization","Displays","Proteins","Electrostatics","Surface texture","Chemical processes","Filters","Mesh generation","Labeling","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376193","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","34","1608","Molecular Surface Abstraction","13"
"Volumetric data commonly has high depth complexity which makes it difficult to judge spatial relationships accurately. There are many different ways to enhance depth perception, such as shading, contours, and shadows. Artists and illustrators frequently employ halos for this purpose. In this technique, regions surrounding the edges of certain structures are darkened or brightened which makes it easier to judge occlusion. Based on this concept, we present a flexible method for enhancing and highlighting structures of interest using GPU-based direct volume rendering. Our approach uses an interactively defined halo transfer function to classify structures of interest based on data value, direction, and position.

"A current research topic in molecular thermodynamics is the condensation of vapor to liquid and the investigation of this process at the molecular level. Condensation is found in many physical phenomena, e.g. the formation of atmospheric clouds or the processes inside steam turbines, where a detailed knowledge of the dynamics of condensation processes will help to optimize energy efficiency and avoid problems with droplets of macroscopic size. The key properties of these processes are the nucleation rate and the critical cluster size. For the calculation of these properties it is essential to make use of a meaningful definition of molecular clusters, which currently is a not completely resolved issue. In this paper a framework capable of interactively visualizing molecular datasets of such nucleation simulations is presented, with an emphasis on the detected molecular clusters. To check the quality of the results of the cluster detection, our framework introduces the concept of flow groups to highlight potential cluster evolution over time which is not detected by the employed algorithm. To confirm the findings of the visual analysis, we coupled the rendering view with a schematic view of the clusters' evolution. This allows to rapidly assess the quality of the molecular cluster detection algorithm and to identify locations in the simulation data in space as well as in time where the cluster detection fails. Thus, thermodynamics researchers can eliminate weaknesses in their cluster detection algorithms. Several examples for the effective and efficient usage of our tool are presented.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376195/","LOCKED","4376195","Univ.

"Conveying shape using feature lines is an important visualization tool in visual computing. The existing feature lines (e.g., ridges, valleys, silhouettes, suggestive contours, etc.) are solely determined by local geometry properties (e.g., normals and curvatures) as well as the view position. This paper is strongly inspired by the observation in human vision and perception that a sudden change in the luminance plays a critical role to faithfully represent and recover the 3D information. In particular, we adopt the edge detection techniques in image processing for 3D shape visualization and present photic extremum lines (PELs) which emphasize significant variations of illumination over 3D surfaces. Comparing with the existing feature lines, PELs are more flexible and offer users more freedom to achieve desirable visualization effects. In addition, the user can easily control the shape visualization by changing the light position, the number of light sources, and choosing various light models. We compare PELs with the existing approaches and demonstrate that PEL is a flexible and effective tool to illustrate 3D surface and volume for visual computing.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376158/","LOCKED","4376158","School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37629748900","1","Xuexiang Xie","37629748900","School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37532431100","2","Ying He","37532431100","School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271188400","3","Feng Tian","37271188400","School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282337400","4","Hock-Soon Seah","37282337400","Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, New York","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37276603700","5","Xianfeng Gu","37276603700","Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, New York","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37276553900","6","Hong Qin","37276553900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","37","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70538","1335","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376158/","Surface and volume illustration","illumination","photic extremum lines (PELs)","silhouettes","suggestive contours","ridges and valleys","digital geometry processing.","","","","Humans","Image edge detection","Lighting","Data visualization","Layout","Geometry","Image processing","Shape control","Solid modeling","","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376158","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","37","1328","An Effective Illustrative Visualization Framework Based on Photic Extremum Lines (PELs)","13"
"We present a general framework for the modeling and optimization of scalable multi-projector displays. Based on this framework, we derive algorithms that can robustly optimize the visual quality of an arbitrary combination of projectors without manual adjustment. When the projectors are tiled, we show that our framework automatically produces blending maps that outperform state-of-the-art projector blending methods. When all the projectors are superimposed, the framework can produce high-resolution images beyond the Nyquist resolution limits of component projectors. When a combination of tiled and superimposed projectors are deployed, the same framework harnesses the best features of both tiled and superimposed multi-projector projection paradigms. The framework creates for the first time a new unified paradigm that is agnostic to a particular configuration of projectors yet robustly optimizes for the brightness, contrast, and resolution of that configuration. In addition, we demonstrate that our algorithms support high resolution video at real-time interactive frame rates achieved on commodity graphics platforms. This work allows for inexpensive, compelling, flexible, and robust large scale visualization systems to be built and deployed very efficiently.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376162/","LOCKED","4376162","Hewlett-Packard Laboratories in Palo Alto, CA.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38300073400","1","Niranjan Damera-Venkata","38300073400","Hewlett-Packard Laboratories in Palo Alto, CA.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37596623500","2","Nelson Chang","37596623500","Hewlett-Packard Laboratories in Palo Alto, CA.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38359782300","3","Jeffrey Dicarlo","38359782300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","16","4","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70536","1367","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376162/","Multi-projector displays","tiled displays","large format displays","blending","stitching","automatic geometric alignment","photometric correction","super-resolution","superimposed projection.","","Displays","Robustness","Visualization","Brightness","Image quality","Image resolution","Graphics","Large-scale systems","Photometry","Solid modeling","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376162","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","38","1360","A Unified Paradigm For Scalable Multi-Projector Displays","13"
"Visualization of uncertainty or error in astrophysical data is seldom available in simulations of astronomical phenomena, and yet almost all rendered attributes possess some degree of uncertainty due to observational error. Uncertainties associated with spatial location typically vary significantly with scale and thus introduce further complexity in the interpretation of a given visualization. This paper introduces effective techniques for visualizing uncertainty in large-scale virtual astrophysical environments. Building upon our previous transparently scalable visualization architecture, we develop tools that enhance the perception and comprehension of uncertainty across wide scale ranges. Our methods include a unified color-coding scheme for representing log-scale distances and percentage errors, an ellipsoid model to represent positional uncertainty, an ellipsoid envelope model to expose trajectory uncertainty, and a magic-glass design supporting the selection of ranges of log-scale distance and uncertainty parameters, as well as an overview mode and a scalable WIM tool for exposing the magnitudes of spatial context and uncertainty.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376197/","LOCKED","4376197","Hong Kong University of Science & Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37881121400","1","Hongwei Li","37881121400","Hong Kong University of Science & Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37336329800","2","Chi-Wing Fu","37336329800","Indiana University, Bloomington","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37835045200","3","Yinggang Li","37835045200","Indiana University, Bloomington","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37333439100","4","Andrew Hanson","37333439100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","24","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70530","1647","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376197/","Uncertainty visualization","large spatial scale","interstellar data","astronomy.","","","","","","","Data visualization","Large-scale systems","Uncertainty","Extraterrestrial measurements","Earth","Ellipsoids","Context modeling","Buildings","Astronomy","Data engineering","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376197","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","39","1640","Visualizing Large-Scale Uncertainty in Astrophysical Data","13"
"Visualization algorithms can have a large number of parameters, making the space of possible rendering results rather high-dimensional. Only a systematic analysis of the perceived quality can truly reveal the optimal setting for each such parameter. However, an exhaustive search in which all possible parameter permutations are presented to each user within a study group would be infeasible to conduct. Additional complications may result from possible parameter co-dependencies. Here, we will introduce an efficient user study design and analysis strategy that is geared to cope with this problem. The user feedback is fast and easy to obtain and does not require exhaustive parameter testing. To enable such a framework we have modified a preference measuring methodology, conjoint analysis, that originated in psychology and is now also widely used in market research. We demonstrate our framework by a study that measures the perceived quality in volume rendering within the context of large parameter spaces.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376200/","LOCKED","4376200","MPI Informatik","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37325999500","1","Joachim Giesen","37325999500","Stony Brook University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273119700","2","Klaus Mueller","37273119700","ETH Zurich","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37703642700","3","Eva Schuberth","37703642700","Stony Brook University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37280763200","4","Lujin Wang","37280763200","EMPA D¨ubendorf","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37680882500","5","Peter Zolliker","37680882500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","17","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70542","1671","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376200/","Conjoint Analysis","Parameterized Algorithms","Volume Visualization","","","","","","","","Volume measurement","Humans","Rendering (computer graphics)","Data visualization","Focusing","Design engineering","Feedback","Testing","Psychology","Market research","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376200","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","40","1664","Conjoint Analysis to Measure the Perceived Quality in Volume Rendering","13"
"Pipeline architectures provide a versatile and efficient mechanism for constructing visualizations, and they have been implemented in numerous libraries and applications over the past two decades. In addition to allowing developers and users to freely combine algorithms, visualization pipelines have proven to work well when streaming data and scale well on parallel distributed- memory computers. However, current pipeline visualization frameworks have a critical flaw: they are unable to manage time varying data. As data flows through the pipeline, each algorithm has access to only a single snapshot in time of the data. This prevents the implementation of algorithms that do any temporal processing such as particle tracing; plotting over time; or interpolation, fitting, or smoothing of time series data. As data acquisition technology improves, as simulation time-integration techniques become more complex, and as simulations save less frequently and regularly, the ability to analyze the time-behavior of data becomes more important. This paper describes a modification to the traditional pipeline architecture that allows it to accommodate temporal algorithms. Furthermore, the architecture allows temporal algorithms to be used in conjunction with algorithms expecting a single time snapshot, thus simplifying software design and allowing adoption into existing pipeline frameworks. Our architecture also continues to work well in parallel distributed-memory environments. We demonstrate our architecture by modifying the popular VTK framework and exposing the functionality to the ParaView application. We use this framework to apply time-dependent algorithms on large data with a parallel cluster computer and thereby exercise a functionality that previously did not exist.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376164/","LOCKED","4376164","Swiss National Supercomputing Centre","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37948935700","1","John Biddiscombe","37948935700","Kitware, Inc.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282729500","2","Berk Geveci","37282729500","Kitware, Inc.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37436263300","3","Ken Martin","37436263300","Sandia National Laboratories","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284250900","4","Kenneth Moreland","37284250900","Sandia National Laboratories","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37265831900","5","David Thompson","37265831900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","21","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70600","1383","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376164/","data-parallel visualization pipeline","time-varying data","","","","","","","","","Pipelines","Computer architecture","Data visualization","Application software","Concurrent computing","Analytical models","Software algorithms","Libraries","Distributed computing","Interpolation","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376164","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","41","1376","Time Dependent Processing in a Parallel Pipeline Architecture","13"
"We present the results of two controlled studies comparing layered surface visualizations under various texture conditions. The task was to estimate surface normals, measured by accuracy of a hand-set surface normal probe. A single surface visualization was compared with the two-surfaces case under conditions of no texture and with projected grid textures. Variations in relative texture spacing on top and bottom surfaces were compared, as well as opacity of the top surface. Significant improvements are found for the textured cases over non-textured surfaces. Either larger or thinner top-surface textures, and lower top surface opacities are shown to give less bottom surface error. Top surface error appears to be highly resilient to changes in texture. Given the results we also present an example of how appropriate textures might be useful in volume visualization.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376199/","LOCKED","4376199","Texas A&M University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37565577300","1","Alethea Bair","37565577300","Texas A&M University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284216700","2","Donald House","37284216700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","14","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70559","1663","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376199/","Perception","optimal visualization","texturing","layered surfaces.","","","","","","","Surface texture","Shape control","Humans","Data visualization","Geologic measurements","Probes","Biomedical imaging","Geology","Isosurfaces","Pediatrics","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376199","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","42","1656","Grid With a View: Optimal Texturing for Perception of Layered Surface Shape","13"

"Acoustic quality in room acoustics is measured by well defined quantities, like definition, which can be derived from simulated impulse response filters or measured values. These take into account the intensity and phase shift of multiple reflections due to a wave front emanating from a sound source. Definition (D50) and clarity (C50) for example correspond to the fraction of the energy received in total to the energy received in the first 50 ms at a certain listener position. Unfortunately, the impulse response measured at a single point does not provide any information about the direction of reflections, and about the reflection surfaces which contribute to this measure. For the visualization of room acoustics, however, this information is very useful since it allows to discover regions with high contribution and provides insight into the influence of all reflecting surfaces to the quality measure. We use the phonon tracing method to calculate the contribution of the reflection surfaces to the impulse response for different listener positions. This data is used to compute importance values for the geometry taking a certain acoustic metric into account. To get a visual insight into the directional aspect, we map the importance to the reflecting surfaces of the geometry. This visualization indicates which parts of the surfaces need to be changed to enhance the chosen acoustic quality measure. We apply our method to the acoustic improvement of a lecture hall by means of enhancing the overall speech comprehensibility (clarity) and evaluate the results using glyphs to visualize the clarity (C50) values at listener positions throughout the room.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376202/","LOCKED","4376202","IRTG Kaiserslautern","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37838754300","1","Frank Michel","37838754300","IRTG Kaiserslautern","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282727900","2","Eduard Deines","37282727900","Fraunhofer ITWM Kaiserslautern","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38281584100","3","Martin Hering-Bertram","38281584100","University of Kaiserslautern and the Institute for Data Analysis and Visualization at the University of California in Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282573700","4","Christoph Garth","37282573700","University of Kaiserslautern","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282578800","5","Hans Hagen","37282578800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70575","1687","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376202/","Sound analytics","Applications of Visualization","Room Acoustics","Phonon Tracing","Acoustic Metric","","","","","","Acoustic reflection","Acoustic measurements","Optical surface waves","Optical reflection","Phonons","Acoustic applications","Geometry","Data visualization","Absorption","Frequency","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376202","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","44","1680","Listener-based Analysis of Surface Importance for Acoustic Metrics","13"
"Perfusion data are dynamic medical image data which characterize the regional blood flow in human tissue. These data bear a great potential in medical diagnosis, since diseases can be better distinguished and detected at an earlier stage compared to static image data. The wide-spread use of perfusion data is hampered by the lack of efficient evaluation methods. For each voxel, a time-intensity curve characterizes the enhancement of a contrast agent. Parameters derived from these curves characterize the perfusion and have to be integrated for diagnosis. The diagnostic evaluation of this multi-field data is challenging and time-consuming due to its complexity. For the visual analysis of such datasets, feature-based approaches allow to reduce the amount of data and direct the user to suspicious areas. We present an interactive visual analysis approach for the evaluation of perfusion data. For this purpose, we integrate statistical methods and interactive feature specification. Correlation analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are applied for dimension reduction and to achieve a better understanding of the inter-parameter relations. Multiple, linked views facilitate the definition of features by brushing multiple dimensions. The specification result is linked to all views establishing a focus+context style of visualization in 3D. We discuss our approach with respect to clinical datasets from the three major application areas: ischemic stroke diagnosis, breast tumor diagnosis, as well as the diagnosis of the coronary heart disease (CHD). It turns out that the significance of perfusion parameters strongly depends on the individual patient, scanning parameters, and data pre-processing.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376166/","LOCKED","4376166","Department of Simulation and Graphics, University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37424645600","1","Steffen Oeltze","37424645600","VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546620400","2","Helmut Doleisch","37546620400","Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274158800","3","Helwig Hauser","37274158800","VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546620600","4","Philipp Muigg","37546620600","Department of Simulation and Graphics, University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37424645300","5","Bernhard Preim","37424645300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","36","3","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70569","1399","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376166/","Multi-field Visualization","Visual Data Mining","Time-varying Volume Data","Integrating InfoVis/SciVis","","","","","","","Data analysis","Principal component analysis","Biomedical imaging","Medical diagnostic imaging","Blood flow","Humans","Medical diagnosis","Diseases","Statistical analysis","Focusing","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376166","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","45","1392","Interactive Visual Analysis of Perfusion Data","13"
"Topology has been an important tool for analyzing scalar data and flow fields in visualization. In this work, we analyze the topology of multivariate image and volume data sets with discontinuities in order to create an efficient, raster-based representation we call IStar. Specifically, the topology information is used to create a dual structure that contains nodes and connectivity information for every segmentable region in the original data set. This graph structure, along with a sampled representation of the segmented data set, is embedded into a standard raster image which can then be substantially downsampled and compressed. During rendering, the raster image is upsampled and the dual graph is used to reconstruct the original function. Unlike traditional raster approaches, our representation can preserve sharp discontinuities at any level of magnification, much like scalable vector graphics. However, because our representation is raster-based, it is well suited to the real-time rendering pipeline.

The vast number of security incidents and other anomalies overwhelms attempts at manual analysis, especially when monitoring service provider backbone links. We present an approach to interactive visualization with a case study indicating that interactive visualization can be applied to gain more insight into these large data sets. We superimpose a hierarchy on IP address space, and study the suitability of Treemap variants for each hierarchy level. Because viewing the whole IP hierarchy at once is not practical for most tasks, we evaluate layout stability when eliding large parts of the hierarchy, while maintaining the visibility and ordering of the data of interest.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376129/","LOCKED","4376129","Univ. of Konstanz, Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37392086200","1","Florian Mansmann","37392086200","Univ. of Konstanz, Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","2","Daniel A.

"This paper describes Show Me, an integrated set of user interface commands and defaults that incorporate automatic presentation into a commercial visual analysis system called Tableau. A key aspect of Tableau is VizQL, a language for specifying views, which is used by Show Me to extend automatic presentation to the generation of tables of views (commonly called small multiple displays). A key research issue for the commercial application of automatic presentation is the user experience, which must support the flow of visual analysis. User experience has not been the focus of previous research on automatic presentation. The Show Me user experience includes the automatic selection of mark types, a command to add a single field to a view, and a pair of commands to build views for multiple fields. Although the use of these defaults and commands is optional, user interface logs indicate that Show Me is used by commercial users.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376133/","LOCKED","4376133","Tableau Software, Seattle","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37372036700","1","Jock Mackinlay","37372036700","Tableau Software, Seattle","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349803800","2","Pat Hanrahan","37349803800","Tableau Software, Seattle","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37442008700","3","Chris Stolte","37442008700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","177","11","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70594","1144","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376133/","Automatic presentation","visual analysis","graphic design","best practices","data visualization","small multiples.","","","","","User interfaces","Graphics","Data analysis","Displays","Best practices","Data visualization","Information analysis","Encoding","Specification languages","","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376133","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","48","1137","Show Me: Automatic Presentation for Visual Analysis","13"
"Surgical approaches tailored to an individual patient's anatomy and pathology have become standard in neurosurgery. Precise preoperative planning of these procedures, however, is necessary to achieve an optimal therapeutic effect. Therefore, multiple radiological imaging modalities are used prior to surgery to delineate the patient's anatomy, neurological function, and metabolic processes. Developing a three-dimensional perception of the surgical approach, however, is traditionally still done by mentally fusing multiple modalities. Concurrent 3D visualization of these datasets can, therefore, improve the planning process significantly. In this paper we introduce an application for planning of individual neurosurgical approaches with high-quality interactive multimodal volume rendering. The application consists of three main modules which allow to (1) plan the optimal skin incision and opening of the skull tailored to the underlying pathology; (2) visualize superficial brain anatomy, function and metabolism; and (3) plan the patient-specific approach for surgery of deep-seated lesions. The visualization is based on direct multi-volume raycasting on graphics hardware, where multiple volumes from different modalities can be displayed concurrently at interactive frame rates. Graphics memory limitations are avoided by performing raycasting on bricked volumes. For preprocessing tasks such as registration or segmentation, the visualization modules are integrated into a larger framework, thus supporting the entire workflow of preoperative planning.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376204/","LOCKED","4376204","VRVis Res.

"We introduce a series of geographically weighted (GW) interactive graphics, or geowigs, and use them to explore spatial relationships at a range of scales. We visually encode information about geographic and statistical proximity and variation in novel ways through gw-choropleth maps, multivariate gw-boxplots, gw-shading and scalograms. The new graphic types reveal information about GW statistics at several scales concurrently. We impement these views in prototype software containing dynamic links and GW interactions that encourage exploration and refine them to consider directional geographies. An informal evaluation uses interactive GW techniques to consider Guerry's dataset of 'moral statistics', casting doubt on correlations originally proposed through visual analysis, revealing new local anomalies and suggesting multivariate geographic relationships. Few attempts at visually synthesising geography with multivariate statistical values at multiple scales have been reported. The geowigs proposed here provide informative representations of multivariate local variation, particularly when combined with interactions that coordinate views and result in gw-shading. We argue that they are widely applicable to area and point-based geographic data and provide a set of methods to support visual analysis using GW statistics through which the effects of geography can be explored at multiple scales.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376135/","LOCKED","4376135","City Univ., London","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37605079900","1","Jason Dykes","37605079900","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945380100","2","Chris Brunsdon","37945380100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","32","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70558","1168","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376135/","Geographical weighting","exploratory data analysis","scale","multivariate","directional","interaction","coordinated views","","","","Visualization","Graphics","Geography","Statistics","Statistical analysis","Extraterrestrial measurements","Extraterrestrial phenomena","Statistical distributions","Software prototyping","Ethics","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376135","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","52","1161","Geographically Weighted Visualization: Interactive Graphics for Scale-Varying Exploratory Analysis","13"
"We describe our visualization process for a particle-based simulation of the formation of the first stars and their impact on cosmic history. The dataset consists of several hundred time-steps of point simulation data, with each time-step containing approximately two million point particles. For each time-step, we interpolate the point data onto a regular grid using a method taken from the radiance estimate of photon mapping [21]. We import the resulting regular grid representation into ParaView [24], with which we extract isosurfaces across multiple variables. Our images provide insights into the evolution of the early universe, tracing the cosmic transition from an initially homogeneous state to one of increasing complexity. Specifically, our visualizations capture the build-up of regions of ionized gas around the first stars, their evolution, and their complex interactions with the surrounding matter. These observations will guide the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope, the key astronomy mission of the next decade.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376206/","LOCKED","4376206","Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of Texas at Austin","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37990427800","1","Paul Navratil","37990427800","Department of Astronomy at the University of Texas at Austin","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087711606","2","Jarrett Johnson","37087711606","Department of Astronomy at the University of Texas at Austin","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945346700","3","Volker Bromm","37945346700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","20","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70526","1718","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376206/","Interpolation","Isosurface","Astronomy","Cosmology.","","","","","","","Isosurfaces","Data mining","Astronomy","Chemical elements","Hydrogen","Data visualization","History","Space missions","Telescopes","","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376206","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","53","1712","Visualization of Cosmological Particle-Based Datasets","13"
"We present a novel approach for analyzing two-dimensional (2D) flow field data based on the idea of invariant moments. Moment invariants have traditionally been used in computer vision applications, and we have adapted them for the purpose of interactive exploration of flow field data. The new class of moment invariants we have developed allows us to extract and visualize 2D flow patterns, invariant under translation, scaling, and rotation. With our approach one can study arbitrary flow patterns by searching a given 2D flow data set for any type of pattern as specified by a user. Further, our approach supports the computation of moments at multiple scales, facilitating fast pattern extraction and recognition. This can be done for critical point classification, but also for patterns with greater complexity. This multi-scale moment representation is also valuable for the comparative visualization of flow field data. The specific novel contributions of the work presented are the mathematical derivation of the new class of moment invariants, their analysis regarding critical point features, the efficient computation of a novel feature space representation, and based upon this the development of a fast pattern recognition algorithm for complex flow structures.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376210/","LOCKED","4376210","University of Kaiserslautern, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37946182500","1","Michael Schlemmer","37946182500","University of Kaiserslautern, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945209200","2","Manuel Heringer","37945209200","University of Kaiserslautern, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945208900","3","Florian Morr","37945208900","Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum f ¨ur Informationstechnik Berlin (ZIB), FU Berlin, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282721800","4","Ingrid Hotz","37282721800","Fraunhofer Institut f ¨ur Techno- und Wirtschaftsmathematik (ITWM) in Kaiserslautern, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282067000","5","Martin Hering-Bertram","37282067000","University of Kaiserslautern, Germany, and the Institute for Data Analysis and Visualization at the University of California, Davis, CA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282573700","6","Christoph Garth","37282573700","Department of Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37722986700","7","Wolfgang Kollmann","37722986700","Institute for Data Analysis and Visualization and Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, CA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282068700","8","Bernd Hamann","37282068700","University of Kaiserslautern, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282578800","9","Hans Hagen","37282578800","43","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70579","1750","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376210/","Flow Visualization","Feature Detection","Pattern Recognition","Image Processing","","","","","","","Data visualization","Pattern recognition","Data mining","Computer vision","Space technology","Feature extraction","Data analysis","Application software","Pattern analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376210","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","54","1743","Moment Invariants for the Analysis of 2D Flow Fields","13"
"This paper presents a method for filtered ridge extraction based on adaptive mesh refinement. It is applicable in situations where the underlying scalar field can be refined during ridge extraction. This requirement is met by the concept of Lagrangian coherent structures which is based on trajectories started at arbitrary sampling grids that are independent of the underlying vector field. The Lagrangian coherent structures are extracted as ridges in finite Lyapunov exponent fields computed from these grids of trajectories. The method is applied to several variants of finite Lyapunov exponents, one of which is newly introduced. High computation time due to the high number of required trajectories is a main drawback when computing Lyapunov exponents of 3-dimensional vector fields. The presented method allows a substantial speed-up by avoiding the seeding of trajectories in regions where no ridges are present or do not satisfy the prescribed filter criteria such as a minimum finite Lyapunov exponent.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376174/","LOCKED","4376174","ETH Zurich, Switzerland","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282541900","1","Filip Sadlo","37282541900","ETH Zurich, Switzerland","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282541100","2","Ronald Peikert","37282541100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","106","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70554","1463","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376174/","ridge extraction","flow visualization","coherent structures","vector field topology","unsteady vector fields","","","","","","Visualization","Lagrangian functions","Adaptive filters","Adaptive mesh refinement","Sampling methods","Topology","Isosurfaces","Grid computing","Computational efficiency","Fluid dynamics","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376174","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","55","1456","Efficient Visualization of Lagrangian Coherent Structures by Filtered AMR Ridge Extraction","13"
"Numerous systems have been developed to display large collections of data for urban contexts; however, most have focused on layering of single dimensions of data and manual calculations to understand relationships within the urban environment. Furthermore, these systems often limit the user's perspectives on the data, thereby diminishing the user's spatial understanding of the viewing region. In this paper, we introduce a highly interactive urban visualization tool that provides intuitive understanding of the urban data. Our system utilizes an aggregation method that combines buildings and city blocks into legible clusters, thus providing continuous levels of abstraction while preserving the user's mental model of the city. In conjunction with a 3D view of the urban model, a separate but integrated information visualization view displays multiple disparate dimensions of the urban data, allowing the user to understand the urban environment both spatially and cognitively in one glance. For our evaluation, expert users from various backgrounds viewed a real city model with census data and confirmed that our system allowed them to gain more intuitive and deeper understanding of the urban model from different perspectives and levels of abstraction than existing commercial urban visualization systems.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376137/","LOCKED","4376137","UNC Charlotte, Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592409400","1","Remco Chang","37592409400","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37948880500","2","Ginette Wessel","37948880500","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282563400","3","Robert Kosara","37282563400","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945352600","4","Eric Sauda","37945352600","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300425000","5","William Ribarsky","37300425000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","33","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70574","1175","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376137/","urban models","information visualization","multi-resolution","","","","","","","","Cities and towns","Data visualization","Electronic mail","Urban planning","Computer science","Computer architecture","Cognitive science","Three dimensional displays","Buildings","Aggregates","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376137","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","56","1169","Legible Cities: Focus-Dependent Multi-Resolution Visualization of Urban Relationships","13"
"Both the resource description framework (RDF), used in the semantic web, and Maya Viz u-forms represent data as a graph of objects connected by labeled edges. Existing systems for flexible visualization of this kind of data require manual specification of the possible visualization roles for each data attribute. When the schema is large and unfamiliar, this requirement inhibits exploratory visualization by requiring a costly up-front data integration step. To eliminate this step, we propose an automatic technique for mapping data attributes to visualization attributes. We formulate this as a schema matching problem, finding appropriate paths in the data model for each required visualization attribute in a visualization template.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376141/","LOCKED","4376141","Stanford University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37870000300","1","Mike Cammarano","37870000300","University of Washington","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087587933","2","Xin Dong","37087587933","Stanford University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37876908500","3","Bryan Chan","37876908500","Stanford University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945252000","4","Jeff Klingner","37945252000","Stanford University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604514900","5","Justin Talbot","37604514900","Google","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284235600","6","Alon Halevy","37284235600","Stanford University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349803800","7","Pat Hanrahan","37349803800","","","","","","","","","","","27","3","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70617","1207","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376141/","Data integration","RDF","attribute inference","","","","","","","","Data visualization","Resource description framework","Space technology","Mashups","Semantic Web","Data models","Web services","Visual databases","Wikipedia","Government","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376141","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","57","1200","Visualization of Heterogeneous Data","13"
"We describe a system for interactively rendering isosurfaces of tetrahedral finite-element scalar fields using coherent ray tracing techniques on the CPU. By employing state-of-the art methods in polygonal ray tracing, namely aggressive packet/frustum traversal of a bounding volume hierarchy, we can accommodate large and time-varying unstructured data. In conjunction with this efficiency structure, we introduce a novel technique for intersecting ray packets with tetrahedral primitives.

"In nature and in flow experiments particles form patterns of swirling motion in certain locations. Existing approaches identify these structures by considering the behavior of stream lines. However, in unsteady flows particle motion is described by path lines which generally gives different swirling patterns than stream lines. We introduce a novel mathematical characterization of swirling motion cores in unsteady flows by generalizing the approach of Sujudi/Haimes to path lines. The cores of swirling particle motion are lines sweeping over time, i.e., surfaces in the space-time domain. They occur at locations where three derived 4D vectors become coplanar. To extract them, we show how to re-formulate the problem using the parallel vectors operator. We apply our method to a number of unsteady flow fields.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376212/","LOCKED","4376212","Zuse Institute Berlin","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282635100","1","Tino Weinkauf","37282635100","Zuse Institute Berlin","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37565764600","2","Jan Sahner","37565764600","Bielefeld University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266875400","3","Holger Theisel","37266875400","Zuse Institute Berlin","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282272000","4","Hans-Christian Hege","37282272000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","45","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70545","1766","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376212/","unsteady flow visualization","feature extraction","particle motion","","","","","","","","Feature extraction","Airplanes","Data mining","Visualization","Turbomachinery","Aircraft","Aerospace industry","Blood flow","Numerical simulation","Robustness","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376212","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","59","1759","Cores of Swirling Particle Motion in Unsteady Flows","13"
"Analyzing, visualizing, and illustrating changes within time-varying volumetric data is challenging due to the dynamic changes occurring between timesteps. The changes and variations in computational fluid dynamic volumes and atmospheric 3D datasets do not follow any particular transformation. Features within the data move at different speeds and directions making the tracking and visualization of these features a difficult task. We introduce a texture-based feature tracking technique to overcome some of the current limitations found in the illustration and visualization of dynamic changes within time-varying volumetric data. Our texture-based technique tracks various features individually and then uses the tracked objects to better visualize structural changes. We show the effectiveness of our texture-based tracking technique with both synthetic and real world time-varying data. Furthermore, we highlight the specific visualization, annotation, registration, and feature isolation benefits of our technique. For instance, we show how our texture-based tracking can lead to insightful visualizations of time-varying data. Such visualizations, more than traditional visualization techniques, can assist domain scientists to explore and understand dynamic changes.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376176/","LOCKED","4376176","University of Maryland, Baltimore County","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37541275000","1","Jesus Caban","37541275000","University of Maryland, Baltimore County","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37278517400","2","Alark Joshi","37278517400","University of Maryland, Baltimore County","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282292000","3","Penny Rheingans","37282292000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","31","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70599","1479","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376176/","Feature tracking","texture-based analysis","flow visualization","time-varying data","visualization","","","","","","Data visualization","Hurricanes","Electronic mail","Predictive models","Weather forecasting","IEEE members","Fluid dynamics","Computational fluid dynamics","Tracking","Data mining","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376176","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","60","1472","Texture-based feature tracking for effective time-varying data visualization","13"
"We present a method for stochastic fiber tract mapping from diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI) implemented on graphics hardware. From the simulated fibers we compute a connectivity map that gives an indication of the probability that two points in the dataset are connected by a neuronal fiber path. A Bayesian formulation of the fiber model is given and it is shown that the inversion method can be used to construct plausible connectivity. An implementation of this fiber model on the graphics processing unit (GPU) is presented. Since the fiber paths can be stochastically generated independently of one another, the algorithm is highly parallelizable. This allows us to exploit the data-parallel nature of the GPU fragment processors. We also present a framework for the connectivity computation on the GPU. Our implementation allows the user to interactively select regions of interest and observe the evolving connectivity results during computation. Results are presented from the stochastic generation of over 250,000 fiber steps per iteration at interactive frame rates on consumer-grade graphics hardware.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376180/","LOCKED","4376180","West Virginia University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294450700","1","Tim McGraw","37294450700","Siemens Corporate Research","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294453300","2","Mariappan Nadar","37294453300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","27","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70597","1511","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376180/","diffusion tensor","magnetic resonance imaging","stochastic tractography","","","","","","","","Stochastic processes","Diffusion tensor imaging","Tensile stress","Visualization","Graphics","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Injuries","Ellipsoids","Magnetic resonance imaging","Hardware","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376180","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","61","1504","Stochastic DT-MRI Connectivity Mapping on the GPU","13"
"Understanding how people use online maps allows data acquisition teams to concentrate their efforts on the portions of the map that are most seen by users. Online maps represent vast databases, and so it is insufficient to simply look at a list of the most-accessed URLs. Hotmap takes advantage of the design of a mapping system's imagery pyramid to superpose a heatmap of the log files over the original maps. Users' behavior within the system can be observed and interpreted. This paper discusses the imagery acquisition task that motivated Hotmap, and presents several examples of information that Hotmap makes visible. We discuss the design choices behind Hotmap, including logarithmic color schemes; low-saturation background images; and tuning images to explore both infrequently-viewed and frequently-viewed spaces.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376139/","LOCKED","4376139","Microsoft Res., Redmond","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37542391000","1","Danyel Fisher","37542391000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","71","4","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70561","1191","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376139/","Geographical visualization","GIS","heatmap","server log analysis","online mapping systems","social navigation","","","","","Cities and towns","Image analysis","Geography","Image color analysis","Space heating","Uniform resource locators","Visualization","Geographic Information Systems","Navigation","Failure analysis","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376139","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","62","1184","Hotmap: Looking at Geographic Attention","13"
"Information visualisation is about gaining insight into data through a visual representation. This data is often multivariate and increasingly, the datasets are very large. To help us explore all this data, numerous visualisation applications, both commercial and research prototypes, have been designed using a variety of techniques and algorithms. Whether they are dedicated to geo-spatial data or skewed hierarchical data, most of the visualisations need to adopt strategies for dealing with overcrowded displays, brought about by too much data to fit in too small a display space. This paper analyses a large number of these clutter reduction methods, classifying them both in terms of how they deal with clutter reduction and more importantly, in terms of the benefits and losses. The aim of the resulting taxonomy is to act as a guide to match techniques to problems where different criteria may have different importance, and more importantly as a means to critique and hence develop existing and new techniques.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376143/","LOCKED","4376143","Lancaster Univ, Lancaster","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283380700","1","Geoffrey Ellis","37283380700","Lancaster Univ, Lancaster","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283381700","2","Alan Dix","37283381700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","215","6","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70535","1223","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376143/","Clutter reduction","information visualisation","occlusion","large datasets","taxonomy.","","","","","","Taxonomy","Data visualization","Computer displays","Prototypes","Algorithm design and analysis","Hardware","Software","Government","Usability","Performance analysis","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376143","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","63","1216","A Taxonomy of Clutter Reduction for Information Visualisation","13"
"Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the human brain, coupled with tractography techniques, enable the extraction of large- collections of three-dimensional tract pathways per subject. These pathways and pathway bundles represent the connectivity between different brain regions and are critical for the understanding of brain related diseases. A flexible and efficient GPU-based rendering technique for DTI tractography data is presented that addresses common performance bottlenecks and image-quality issues, allowing interactive render rates to be achieved on commodity hardware. An occlusion query-based pathway LoD management system for streamlines/streamtubes/tuboids is introduced that optimizes input geometry, vertex processing, and fragment processing loads, and helps reduce overdraw. The tuboid, a fully-shaded streamtube impostor constructed entirely on the GPU from streamline vertices, is also introduced. Unlike full streamtubes and other impostor constructs, tuboids require little to no preprocessing or extra space over the original streamline data. The supported fragment processing levels of detail range from texture-based draft shading to full raycast normal computation, Phong shading, environment mapping, and curvature-correct text labeling. The presented text labeling technique for tuboids provides adaptive, aesthetically pleasing labels that appear attached to the surface of the tubes. Furthermore, an occlusion query aggregating and scheduling scheme for tuboids is described that reduces the query overhead. Results for a tractography dataset are presented, and demonstrate that LoD-managed tuboids offer benefits over traditional streamtubes both in performance and appearance.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376178/","LOCKED","4376178","Calit2, University of California, Irvine","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37967789400","1","Vid Petrovic","37967789400","University of California, Irvine","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37949613300","2","James Fallon","37949613300","Calit2, University of California, San Diego","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282967400","3","Falko Kuester","37282967400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","31","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70532","1495","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376178/","Tuboids","streamtubes","interactive gpu-centric rendering","neuronal pathways.","","","","","","","Visualization","Diffusion tensor imaging","Streaming media","Labeling","Humans","Data mining","Diseases","Rendering (computer graphics)","Computer graphics","Hardware","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376178","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","64","1488","Visualizing Whole-Brain DTI Tractography with GPU-based Tuboids and LoD Management","13"
"This paper describes a novel method for creating surface models of multi-material components using dual energy computed tomography (DECT). The application scenario is metrology and dimensional measurement in industrial high resolution 3D X-ray computed tomography (3DCT). Based on the dual source / dual exposure technology this method employs 3DCT scans of a high precision micro-focus and a high energy macro-focus X-ray source. The presented work makes use of the advantages of dual X-ray exposure technology in order to facilitate dimensional measurements of multi-material components with high density material within low density material. We propose a workflow which uses image fusion and local surface extraction techniques: a prefiltering step reduces noise inherent in the data. For image fusion the datasets have to be registered. In the fusion step the benefits of both scans are combined. The structure of the specimen is taken from the low precision, blurry, high energy dataset while the sharp edges are adopted and fused into the resulting image from the high precision, crisp, low energy dataset. In the final step a reliable surface model is extracted from the fused dataset using a local adaptive technique. The major contribution of this paper is the development of a specific workflow for dimensional measurements of multi-material industrial components, which takes two X-ray CT datasets with complementary strengths and weaknesses into account. The performance of the workflow is discussed using a test specimen as well as two real world industrial parts. As result, a significant improvement in overall measurement precision, surface geometry and mean deviation to reference measurement compared to single exposure scans was facilitated.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376182/","LOCKED","4376182","Upper Austrian Univ. of Appl.

"In many domains, increased collaboration has lead to more innovation by fostering the sharing of knowledge, skills, and ideas. Shared analysis of information visualizations does not only lead to increased information processing power, but team members can also share, negotiate, and discuss their views and interpretations on a dataset and contribute unique perspectives on a given problem. Designing technologies to support collaboration around information visualizations poses special challenges and relatively few systems have been designed. We focus on supporting small groups collaborating around information visualizations in a co-located setting, using a shared interactive tabletop display. We introduce an analysis of challenges and requirements for the design of co-located collaborative information visualization systems. We then present a new system that facilitates hierarchical data comparison tasks for this type of collaborative work.

"With the exponential growth in size of geometric data, it is becoming increasingly important to make effective use of multilevel caches, limited disk storage, and bandwidth. As a result, recent work in the visualization community has focused either on designing sequential access compression schemes or on producing cache-coherent layouts of (uncompressed) meshes for random access. Unfortunately combining these two strategies is challenging as they fundamentally assume conflicting modes of data access. In this paper, we propose a novel order-preserving compression method that supports transparent random access to compressed triangle meshes. Our decompression method selectively fetches from disk, decodes, and caches in memory requested parts of a mesh. We also provide a general mesh access API for seamless mesh traversal and incidence queries. While the method imposes no particular mesh layout, it is especially suitable for cache-oblivious layouts, which minimize the number of decompression I/O requests and provide high cache utilization during access to decompressed, in-memory portions of the mesh. Moreover, the transparency of our scheme enables improved performance without the need for application code changes. We achieve compression rates on the order of 20:1 and significantly improved I/O performance due to reduced data transfer. To demonstrate the benefits of our method, we implement two common applications as benchmarks. By using cache-oblivious layouts for the input models, we observe 2-6 times overall speedup compared to using uncompressed meshes.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376184/","LOCKED","4376184","Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37066068100","1","Sung-eui Yoon","37066068100","Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37269320000","2","Peter Lindstrom","37269320000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","24","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70585","1543","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376184/","Mesh compression","random access","cache-coherent layouts","mesh data structures","external memory algorithms","","","","","","Bandwidth","Data visualization","Data structures","Memory management","Delay","Space technology","Cache storage","Decoding","Computer displays","Computational modeling","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376184","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","67","1536","Random-Accessible Compressed Triangle Meshes","13"
"Treemaps provide an interesting solution for representing hierarchical data. However, most studies have mainly focused on layout algorithms and paid limited attention to the interaction with treemaps. This makes it difficult to explore large data sets and to get access to details, especially to those related to the leaves of the trees. We propose the notion of zoomable treemaps (ZTMs), an hybridization between treemaps and zoomable user interfaces that facilitates the navigation in large hierarchical data sets. By providing a consistent set of interaction techniques, ZTMs make it possible for users to browse through very large data sets (e.g., 700,000 nodes dispatched amongst 13 levels). These techniques use the structure of the displayed data to guide the interaction and provide a way to improve interactive navigation in treemaps.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376147/","LOCKED","4376147","Univ. of Grenoble 1, Grenoble","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945254300","1","Renaud Blanch","37945254300","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38342554600","2","Eric Lecolinet","38342554600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","35","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70540","1253","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376147/","Information visualization","multi-scale interaction","structure-aware navigation","zoomable treemaps.","","","","","","","Navigation","User interfaces","Tree graphs","Data visualization","File systems","Filling","Layout","","","","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376147","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","68","1248","Browsing Zoomable Treemaps: Structure-Aware Multi-Scale Navigation Techniques","13"
"In interfaces that provide multiple visual information resolutions (VIR), low-VIR overviews typically sacrifice visual details for display capacity, with the assumption that users can select regions of interest to examine at higher VI Rs. Designers can create low VIRs based on multi-level structure inherent in the data, but have little guidance with single-level data. To better guide design tradeoff between display capacity and visual target perceivability, we looked at overview use in two multiple-VIR interfaces with high-VIR displays either embedded within, or separate from, the overviews. We studied two visual requirements for effective overview and found that participants would reliably use the low-VIR overviews only when the visual targets were simple and had small visual spans. Otherwise, at least 20% chose to use the high-VIR view exclusively. Surprisingly, neither of the multiple-VIR interfaces provided performance benefits when compared to using the high-VIR view alone. However, we did observe benefits in providing side-by-side comparisons for target matching. We conjecture that the high cognitive load of multiple-VIR interface interactions, whether real or perceived, is a more considerable barrier to their effective use than was previously considered.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376151/","LOCKED","4376151","Univ. of British Columbia, Vancouver","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37873130000","1","Heidi Lam","37873130000","IEEE Computer Society","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349490300","2","Tamara Munzner","37349490300","IEEE Computer Society","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37587984100","3","Robert Kincaid","37587984100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","27","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70583","1285","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376151/","Multiple resolutions","overview use","user study.","","","","","","","","Displays","Electronic mail","Data visualization","History","Object detection","Encoding","","","","","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376151","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","69","1278","Overview Use in Multiple Visual Information Resolution Interfaces","13"
"We present a powerful framework for 3D-texture-based rendering of multiple arbitrarily intersecting volumetric datasets. Each volume is represented by a multi-resolution octree-based structure and we use out-of-core techniques to support extremely large volumes. Users define a set of convex polyhedral volume lenses, which may be associated with one or more volumetric datasets. The volumes or the lenses can be interactively moved around while the region inside each lens is rendered using interactively defined multi-volume shaders. Our rendering pipeline splits each lens into multiple convex regions such that each region is homogenous and contains a fixed number of volumes. Each such region is further split by the brick boundaries of the associated octree representations. The resulting puzzle of lens fragments is sorted in front-to-back or back-to-front order using a combination of a view-dependent octree traversal and a GPU-based depth peeling technique. Our current implementation uses slice-based volume rendering and allows interactive roaming through multiple intersecting multi-gigabyte volumes.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376190/","LOCKED","4376190","Bauhaus-Univ.

"Spatializations represent non-spatial data using a spatial layout similar to a map. We present an experiment comparing different visual representations of spatialized data, to determine which representations are best for a non-trivial search and point estimation task. Primarily, we compare point-based displays to 2D and 3D information landscapes. We also compare a colour (hue) scale to a grey (lightness) scale. For the task we studied, point-based spatializations were far superior to landscapes, and 2D landscapes were superior to 3D landscapes. Little or no benefit was found for redundantly encoding data using colour or greyscale combined with landscape height. 3D landscapes with no colour scale (height-only) were particularly slow and inaccurate. A colour scale was found to be better than a greyscale for all display types, but a greyscale was helpful compared to height-only. These results suggest that point-based spatializations should be chosen over landscape representations, at least for tasks involving only point data itself rather than derived information about the data space.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376149/","LOCKED","4376149","University of Victoria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275861300","1","Melanie Tory","37275861300","University of Victoria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37568763300","2","David Sprague","37568763300","University of Victoria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37956239000","3","Fuqu Wu","37956239000","University of Victoria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37952248400","4","Wing Yan So","37952248400","University of British Columbia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349490300","5","Tamara Munzner","37349490300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","24","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70596","1269","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376149/","Spatialization","Information Landscape","User Study","Numerosity","3D","2D","Colour","Greyscale","Surface","Points","Data visualization","Surface topography","Encoding","Surface fitting","Two dimensional displays","Visual databases","Three dimensional displays","Spatial databases","Fuel economy","Usability","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376149","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","71","1262","Spatialization Design: Comparing Points and Landscapes","13"
"We present a directed acyclic graph visualisation designed to allow interaction with a set of multiple classification trees, specifically to find overlaps and differences between groups of trees and individual trees. The work is motivated by the need to find a representation for multiple trees that has the space-saving property of a general graph representation and the intuitive parent-child direction cues present in individual representation of trees. Using example taxonomic data sets, we describe augmentations to the common barycenter DAG layout method that reveal shared sets of child nodes between common parents in a clearer manner. Other interactions such as displaying the multiple ancestor paths of a node when it occurs in several trees, and revealing intersecting sibling sets within the context of a single DAG representation are also discussed.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376153/","LOCKED","4376153","IEEE Computer Society","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37739295500","1","Martin Graham","37739295500","Napier Univ, Edinburgh","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37334180100","2","Jessie Kennedy","37334180100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","19","4","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70556","1301","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376153/","Multiple trees","Directed Acyclic Graph.","","","","","","","","","Visualization","Tree graphs","Classification tree analysis","Tree data structures","Testing","Merging","Taxonomy","Feedback","History","Bibliographies","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376153","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","72","1294","Exploring Multiple Trees through DAG Representations","13"
"Multiple spatially-related videos are increasingly used in security, communication, and other applications. Since it can be difficult to understand the spatial relationships between multiple videos in complex environments (e.g. to predict a person's path through a building), some visualization techniques, such as video texture projection, have been used to aid spatial understanding. In this paper, we identify and begin to characterize an overall class of visualization techniques that combine video with 3D spatial context. This set of techniques, which we call contextualized videos, forms a design palette which must be well understood so that designers can select and use appropriate techniques that address the requirements of particular spatial video tasks. In this paper, we first identify user tasks in video surveillance that are likely to benefit from contextualized videos and discuss the video, model, and navigation related dimensions of the contextualized video design space. We then describe our contextualized video testbed which allows us to explore this design space and compose various video visualizations for evaluation. Finally, we describe the results of our process to identify promising design patterns through user selection of visualization features from the design space, followed by user interviews.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376188/","LOCKED","4376188","Center for HCI at Virginia Tech","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601156200","1","Yi Wang","37601156200","Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37391946800","2","David M.

"Hardware-accelerated volume rendering using the GPU is now the standard approach for real-time volume rendering, although limited graphics memory can present a problem when rendering large volume data sets. Volumetric compression in which the decompression is coupled to rendering has been shown to be an effective solution to this problem; however, most existing techniques were developed in the context of software volume rendering, and all but the simplest approaches are prohibitive in a real-time hardware-accelerated volume rendering context. In this paper we present a novel block-based transform coding scheme designed specifically with real-time volume rendering in mind, such that the decompression is fast without sacrificing compression quality. This is made possible by consolidating the inverse transform with dequantization in such a way as to allow most of the reprojection to be precomputed. Furthermore, we take advantage of the freedom afforded by offline compression in order to optimize the encoding as much as possible while hiding this complexity from the decoder. In this context we develop a new block classification scheme which allows us to preserve perceptually important features in the compression. The result of this work is an asymmetric transform coding scheme that allows very large volumes to be compressed and then decompressed in real-time while rendering on the GPU.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376192/","LOCKED","4376192","Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945247900","1","Nathaniel Fout","37945247900","Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275869400","2","Kwan-Liu Ma","37275869400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","38","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70516","1607","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376192/","Volume Compression","Compressed Volume Rendering","Transform Coding","Hardware-accelerated Volume Rendering","","","","","","","Transform coding","Rendering (computer graphics)","Graphics","Hardware","Pipelines","Data visualization","Encoding","Decoding","Resource management","Production","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376192","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","74","1600","Transform Coding for Hardware-accelerated Volume Rendering","13"
"This paper presents a new algorithm for force directed graph layout on the GPU. The algorithm, whose goal is to compute layouts accurately and quickly, has two contributions. The first contribution is proposing a general multi-level scheme, which is based on spectral partitioning. The second contribution is computing the layout on the GPU. Since the GPU requires a data parallel programming model, the challenge is devising a mapping of a naturally unstructured graph into a well-partitioned structured one. This is done by computing a balanced partitioning of a general graph. This algorithm provides a general multi-level scheme, which has the potential to be used not only for computation on the GPU, but also on emerging multi-core architectures. The algorithm manages to compute high quality layouts of large graphs in a fraction of the time required by existing algorithms of similar quality. An application for visualization of the topologies of ISP (Internet service provider) networks is presented.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376155/","LOCKED","4376155","Technion, Israel Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37646534300","1","Yaniv Frishman","37646534300","Technion, Israel Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37337567000","2","Ayellet Tal","37337567000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","69","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70580","1319","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376155/","Graph layout","GPU","graph partitioning.","","","","","","","","Partitioning algorithms","Acceleration","Application software","Visualization","High performance computing","Parallel programming","Computer architecture","Quality management","Network topology","Web and internet services","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376155","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","75","1310","Multi-Level Graph Layout on the GPU","13"
"Proteins are highly flexible and large amplitude deformations of their structure, also called slow dynamics, are often decisive to their function. We present a two-level rendering approach that enables visualization of slow dynamics of large protein assemblies. Our approach is aligned with a hierarchical model of large scale molecules. Instead of constantly updating positions of large amounts of atoms, we update the position and rotation of residues, i.e., higher level building blocks of a protein. Residues are represented by one vertex only indicating its position and additional information defining the rotation. The atoms in the residues are generated on-the-fly on the GPU, exploiting the new graphics hardware geometry shader capabilities. Moreover, we represent the atoms by billboards instead of tessellated spheres. Our representation is then significantly faster and pixel precise. We demonstrate the usefulness of our new approach in the context of our collaborative bioinformatics project.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376194/","LOCKED","4376194","Christian Michelsen Research, Norway","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37842366200","1","Ove Daae Lampe","37842366200","Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Norway","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282726800","2","Ivan Viola","37282726800","Computational Biology Unit/BCCS, University of Bergen, Norway","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945246100","3","Nathalie Reuter","37945246100","Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Norway","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274158800","4","Helwig Hauser","37274158800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","28","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70517","1623","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376194/","Molecular visualization","hardware acceleration","protein dynamics.","","","","","","","","Visualization","Proteins","Amino acids","Assembly","Hardware","Computational modeling","Biology computing","Computer Society","Large-scale systems","Graphics","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376194","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","76","1616","Two-Level Approach to Efficient Visualization of Protein Dynamics","13"
"Much of the visualization research has focused on improving the rendering quality and speed, and enhancing the perceptibility of features in the data. Recently, significant emphasis has been placed on focus+context (F+C) techniques (e.g., fisheye views and magnification lens) for data exploration in addition to viewing transformation and hierarchical navigation. However, most of the existing data exploration techniques rely on the manipulation of viewing attributes of the rendering system or optical attributes of the data objects, with users being passive viewers. In this paper, we propose a more active approach to data exploration, which attempts to mimic how we would explore data if we were able to hold it and interact with it in our hands. This involves allowing the users to physically or actively manipulate the geometry of a data object. While this approach has been traditionally used in applications, such as surgical simulation, where the original geometry of the data objects is well understood by the users, there are several challenges when this approach is generalized for applications, such as flow and information visualization, where there is no common perception as to the normal or natural geometry of a data object. We introduce a taxonomy and a set of transformations especially for illustrative deformation of general data exploration. We present combined geometric or optical illustration operators for focus+context visualization, and examine the best means for preventing the deformed context from being misperceived. We demonstrated the feasibility of this generalization with examples of flow, information and video visualization.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376157/","LOCKED","4376157","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282925900","1","Carlos Correa","37282925900","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274132700","2","Debora Silver","37274132700","Department of Computer Science, University of Wales, Swansea","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37280982800","3","Mi Chen","37280982800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","25","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70565","1327","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376157/","Volume deformation","focus+context visualization","interaction techniques","","","","","","","","Data visualization","Focusing","Cognitive science","Silver","Surgery","Information geometry","Geometrical optics","Taxonomy","Lenses","Navigation","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376157","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","77","1320","Illustrative Deformation for Data Exploration","13"

"We present novel, comprehensive visualization techniques for the diagnosis of patients with coronary artery disease using segmented cardiac MRI data. We extent an accepted medical visualization technique called the bull's eye plot by removing discontinuities, preserving the volumetric nature of the left ventricular wall and adding anatomical context. The resulting volumetric bull's eye plot can be used for the assessment of transmurality. We link these visualizations to a 3D view that presents viability information in a detailed anatomical context. We combine multiple MRI scans (whole heart anatomical data, late enhancement data) and multiple segmentations (polygonal heart model, late enhancement contours, coronary artery tree). By selectively combining different rendering techniques we obtain comprehensive yet intuitive visualizations of the various data sources.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376196/","LOCKED","4376196","Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, Vienna University of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869997400","1","Maurice Termeer","37869997400","Philips Medical Systems","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086889017","2","Javier Olivan Bescos","37086889017","Philips Medical Systems","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37374875300","3","Marcel Breeuwer","37374875300","Eindhoven University of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282551500","4","Anna Vilanova","37282551500","Philips Medical Systems","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37374887400","5","Frans Gerritsen","37374887400","Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, Vienna University of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284271200","6","Eduard Gr??ller","37284271200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","34","12","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70550","1639","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376196/","Cardiac MRI","late enhancement","viability","bull's eye plot.","","","","","","","Coronary arteriosclerosis","Magnetic resonance imaging","Data visualization","Heart","Myocardium","Arteries","Muscles","Medical diagnostic imaging","Blood","Protocols","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376196","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","79","1632","CoViCAD: Comprehensive Visualization of Coronary Artery Disease","13"
"Direct volume rendering techniques map volumetric attributes (e.g., density, gradient magnitude, etc.) to visual styles. Commonly this mapping is specified by a transfer function. The specification of transfer functions is a complex task and requires expert knowledge about the underlying rendering technique. In the case of multiple volumetric attributes and multiple visual styles the specification of the multi-dimensional transfer function becomes more challenging and non-intuitive. We present a novel methodology for the specification of a mapping from several volumetric attributes to multiple illustrative visual styles. We introduce semantic layers that allow a domain expert to specify the mapping in the natural language of the domain. A semantic layer defines the mapping of volumetric attributes to one visual style. Volumetric attributes and visual styles are represented as fuzzy sets. The mapping is specified by rules that are evaluated with fuzzy logic arithmetics. The user specifies the fuzzy sets and the rules without special knowledge about the underlying rendering technique. Semantic layers allow for a linguistic specification of the mapping from attributes to visual styles replacing the traditional transfer function specification.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376159/","LOCKED","4376159","Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, Vienna University of Technology, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37828701300","1","Peter Rautek","37828701300","Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, Vienna University of Technology, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37265895700","2","Stefan Bruckner","37265895700","Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, Vienna University of Technology, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282552200","3","Eduard Groller","37282552200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","44","10","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70591","1343","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376159/","Illustrative Visualization","Focus+Context Techniques","Volume Visualization","","","","","","","","Transfer functions","Fuzzy sets","Fuzzy logic","Natural languages","Arithmetic","Visualization","Rendering (computer graphics)","User interfaces","Focusing","Density measurement","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376159","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","80","1336","Semantic Layers for Illustrative Volume Rendering","13"
"Multi-projector displays today are automatically registered, both geometrically and photometrically, using cameras. Existing registration techniques assume pre-calibrated projectors and cameras that are devoid of imperfections such as lens distortion. In practice, however, these devices are usually imperfect and uncalibrated. Registration of each of these devices is often more challenging than the multi-projector display registration itself. To make tiled projection-based displays accessible to a layman user we should allow the use of uncalibrated inexpensive devices that are prone to imperfections. In this paper, we make two important advances in this direction. First, we present a new geometric registration technique that can achieve geometric alignment in the presence of severe projector lens distortion using a relatively inexpensive low-resolution camera. This is achieved via a closed-form model that relates the projectors to cameras, in planar multi-projector displays, using rational Bezier patches. This enables us to geometrically calibrate a 3000 times 2500 resolution planar multi-projector display made of 3 times 3 array of nine severely distorted projectors using a low resolution (640 times 480) VGA camera. Second, we present a photometric self-calibration technique for a projector-camera pair. This allows us to photometrically calibrate the same display made of nine projectors using a photometrically uncalibrated camera. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that allows geometrically imperfect projectors and photometrically uncalibrated cameras in calibrating multi-projector displays.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376163/","LOCKED","4376163","University of California, Irvine","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37828782600","1","Ezekiel Bhasker","37828782600","University of California, Irvine","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37927188200","2","Ray Juang","37927188200","University of California, Irvine","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37408075400","3","Aditi Majumder","37408075400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","23","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70586","1375","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=4376163","Geometric calibration","photometric calibration","tiled displays","","","","","","","","Displays","Photometry","Cameras","Lenses","Calibration","Educational institutions","Visualization","Rendering (computer graphics)","Collaborative work","Laboratories","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376163","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","81","1368","Registration Techniques for Using Imperfect and Par tially Calibrated Devices in Planar Multi-Projector Displays","13"
"Direct volume rendering has proved to be an effective visualization method for medical data sets and has reached wide-spread clinical use. The diagnostic exploration, in essence, corresponds to a tissue classification task, which is often complex and time-consuming. Moreover, a major problem is the lack of information on the uncertainty of the classification, which can have dramatic consequences for the diagnosis. In this paper this problem is addressed by proposing animation methods to convey uncertainty in the rendering. The foundation is a probabilistic Transfer Function model which allows for direct user interaction with the classification. The rendering is animated by sampling the probability domain over time, which results in varying appearance for uncertain regions. A particularly promising application of this technique is a ""sensitivity lens"" applied to focus regions in the data set. The methods have been evaluated by radiologists in a study simulating the clinical task of stenosis assessment, in which the animation technique is shown to outperform traditional rendering in terms of assessment accuracy.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376198/","LOCKED","4376198","Center for Medical Image Science and Visualization (CMIV), Link¨oping University, and Sectra-Imtec AB","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284209100","1","Claes Lundström","37284209100","Division for Visual Information Technology and Applications (VITA), Link¨oping University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284208400","2","Patric Ljung","37284208400","Center for Medical Image Science and Visualization (CMIV), Link¨oping University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604521200","3","Anders Persson","37604521200","Division for Visual Information Technology and Applications (VITA), Link¨oping University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284192000","4","Anders Ynnerman","37284192000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","77","2","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70518","1655","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376198/","Uncertainty","probability","medical visualization","volume rendering","transfer function","","","","","","Uncertainty","Animation","Data visualization","Biomedical imaging","Medical diagnostic imaging","Transfer functions","Focusing","Computed tomography","Sampling methods","Medical simulation","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376198","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","82","1648","Uncertainty Visualization in Medical Volume Rendering Using Probabilistic Animation","13"
"Online pick'em games, such as the recent NCAA college basketball March Madness tournament, form a large and rapidly growing industry. In these games, players make predictions on a tournament bracket that defines which competitors play each other and how they proceed toward a single champion. Throughout the course of the tournament, players monitor the brackets to track progress and to compare predictions made by multiple players. This is often a complex sense making task. The classic bracket visualization was designed for use on paper and utilizes an incrementally additive system in which the winner of each match-up is rewritten in the next round as the tournament progresses. Unfortunately, this representation requires a significant amount of space and makes it relatively difficult to get a quick overview of the tournament state since competitors take arbitrary paths through the static bracket. In this paper, we present AdaptiviTree, a novel visualization that adaptively deforms the representation of the tree and uses its shape to convey outcome information. AdaptiviTree not only provides a more compact and understandable representation, but also allows overlays that display predictions as well as other statistics. We describe results from a lab study we conducted to explore the efficacy of AdaptiviTree, as well as from a deployment of the system in a recent real-world sports tournament.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376130/","LOCKED","4376130","Microsoft Res., Redmond","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37955052000","1","Desney Tan","37955052000","Microsoft Res., Redmond","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37960251500","2","Greg Smith","37960251500","Microsoft Res., Redmond","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37293389400","3","Bongshin Lee","37293389400","Microsoft Res., Redmond","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37448060300","4","George Robertson","37448060300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70537","1120","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4376130/","Online fantasy sports","tournament","bracket","picks","adaptive tree visualization.","","","","","","Visualization","Toy industry","Educational institutions","Monitoring","Shape","Displays","Statistics","Jupiter","Economic forecasting","Industrial economics","4376125","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376130","Nov.-Dec. 2007","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2007","IEEE","83","1113","AdaptiviTree: Adaptive Tree Visualization for Tournament-Style Brackets","13"
