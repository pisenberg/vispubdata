"We present a visualization tool to enhance situation awareness for Global Argus, a system that tracks and detects indications and warnings of biological events in near real time. Because Global Argus generates massive amounts of data daily, its analysts often struggle to interpret the information. To overcome this problem, we have developed the Global Argus situation awareness tool (GASAT) using the InteleView/World Wind geographical information system. This tool allows users to visualize current and past events in a particular region, and thus to understand how events evolve over time. Combined with the other tools that we are developing, GASAT will contribute to enhanced situation awareness in the tracking and detection of biological events.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4389023/","LOCKED","4389023","Georgetown University. e-mail: choi@isis.georgetown.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37964473000","1","Jae Choi","37964473000","Viznox, Inc. e-mail: sjlee@viznox.com","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37966125200","2","Sang-joon Lee","37966125200","Georgetown University. e-mail: gigitashvili@isis.georgetown.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37946376100","3","Sarah Gigitashvilli","37946376100","Georgetown University. e-mail: wilson@isis.georgetown.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37958923500","4","James Wilson","37958923500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","0","30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","Sacramento, CA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2007.4389023","214","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4389023/","visualization","situation awareness","biosurveillance","biological events","visual analytics","","","Data visualization","Event detection","Humans","Computer graphics","Diseases","Animals","NASA","Real time systems","Data analysis","Information analysis","4388977","978-1-4244-1659-2","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-1659-2","07EX2042","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4389023","30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","4388976","2007 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2007","IEEE","5","213","Situation Awareness Tool for Global Argus"
"This paper presents a theory of analytical discourse and a formal model of the intentional structure of visual analytic reasoning process. Our model rests on the theory of collaborative discourse, and allows for cooperative human-machine communication in visual interactive dialogues. Using a sample discourse from a crisis management scenario, we demonstrated the utility of our theory in characterizing the discourse context and collaboration. In particular, we view analytical discourse as plans consisting of complex mental attitude towards analytical tasks and issues. Under this view, human reasoning and computational analysis become integral part of the collaborative plan that evolves through discourse.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4389025/","LOCKED","4389025","College of Information Sciences and Technology, Penn State University, University Park, PA.

"Many dynamic networks have associated geological information. Here we present two complementing visual analysis methods for such networks. The first one provides an overview with summerized information while the second one presents a more detailed view. The geological information is encoded in the network layout, which is designed to help maintain user's mental map. We also combined visualization with social network analysis to facilitate knowledge discovery, especially to understand network changes in the context overall evolution.

"C-GROUP is a tool for analyzing dynamic group membership in social networks over time. Unlike most network visualization tools, which show the group structure within an entire network, or the group membership for a single actor, C-GROUP allows users to focus their analysis on a pair of individuals of interest. And unlike most dynamic social network visualization tools, which focus on the addition and deletion of nodes (actors) and edges (relationships) over time, C-GROUP focuses on changing group memberships over time. C-GROUP provides users with a flexible interface for defining (and redefining) groups interactively, and allows users to view the changing group memberships for the pair over time. This helps to highlight the similarities and differences between the individuals and their evolving group memberships. C-GROUP allows users to dynamically select the time granularity of the temporal evolution and supports two novel visual representations of the evolving group memberships. This flexibility gives users alternate views that are appropriate for different network sizes and provides users with different insights into the grouping behavior.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4389022/","LOCKED","4389022","University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742. kang@cs.umd.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37291403000","1","Hyunmo Kang","37291403000","University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742. getoor@cs.umd.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37829614900","2","Lise Getoor","37829614900","Georgetown University, Washington, DC 20052. singh@cs.georgetown.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37691176100","3","Lisa Singh","37691176100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2","0","30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","Sacramento, CA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2007.4389022","212","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4389022/","","","","","","","","Visual analytics","Social network services","Navigation","Data visualization","Educational institutions","Data analysis","Information analysis","Bipartite graph","Communication networks","Electronic mail","4388977","978-1-4244-1659-2","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-1659-2","07EX2042","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4389022","30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","4388976","2007 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2007","IEEE","14","211","C-GROUP: A Visual Analytic Tool for Pairwise Analysis of Dynamic Group Membership"
"The presence of highly tangled patterns in spectra and other serial data exacerbates the difficulty of performing visual comparison between a test model for a particular pattern and the data. The use of a simple map that plants peaks in the data directly onto their corresponding position in a residual plot with respect to a chosen test model not only retrieves the advantages of dynamic regression plotting, but in practical cases also causes patterns in the data to congregate in meaningful ways with respect to more than one reference curve in the plane. The technique is demonstrated on a polyphonic music signal.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4389024/","LOCKED","4389024","ECE Department, Union College, Schenectady, NY. e-mail: catravap@union.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37062416800","1","Palmyra Catravas","37062416800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","Sacramento, CA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2007.4389024","216","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4389024/","I.5.5 [Pattern recognition]: Implementation¿Interactive systems","","","","","","","Data visualization","Testing","Frequency","Animation","Spirals","Image segmentation","Educational institutions","Performance evaluation","Music information retrieval","Multiple signal classification","4388977","978-1-4244-1659-2","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-1659-2","07EX2042","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4389024","30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","4388976","2007 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2007","IEEE","15","215","Spectra transformed for model-testing and visual exploration"
"Computational and experimental sciences produce and collect ever- larger and complex datasets, often in large-scale, multi-institution projects. The inability to gain insight into complex scientific phenomena using current software tools is a bottleneck facing virtually all endeavors of science. In this paper, we introduce Sunfall, a collaborative visual analytics system developed for the Nearby Supernova Factory, an international astrophysics experiment and the largest data volume supernova search currently in operation. Sunfall utilizes novel interactive visualization and analysis techniques to facilitate deeper scientific insight into complex, noisy, high-dimensional, high-volume, time-critical data. The system combines novel image processing algorithms, statistical analysis, and machine learning with highly interactive visual interfaces to enable collaborative, user-driven scientific exploration of supernova image and spectral data. Sunfall is currently in operation at the Nearby Supernova Factory; it is the first visual analytics system in production use at a major astrophysics project.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4389026/","LOCKED","4389026","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

"Visual Analytics has become a rapidly growing field of study. It is also a field that is addressing very significant real world problems in homeland security, business analytics, emergency management, genetics and bioinformatics, investigative analysis, medical analytics, and other areas. For both these reasons, it is attracting new funding and will continue to do so in the future. Visual analytics has also become an international field, with significant research efforts in Canada, Europe, and Australia, as well as the U.S. There is significant new research funding in Canada and Germany with other efforts being discussed, including a major program sponsored by the European Union. The contributors to this panel are some of the primary thought leaders providing research funding or involved in setting up the funding apparatus. We have asked them to present their needs, funding programs, and expectations from the research community. They all come from different perspectives, different missions, and different expectations. They will present their views of the range of activity in both the U.S. and internationally and discuss what is coming.

"Visual analytics experts realize that one effective way to push the field forward and to develop metrics for measuring the performance of various visual analytics components is to hold an annual competition. The second visual analytics science and technology (VAST) contest was held in conjunction with the 2007 IEEE VAST symposium. In this contest participants were to use visual analytic tools to explore a large heterogeneous data collection to construct a scenario and find evidence buried in the data of illegal and terrorist activities that were occurring. A synthetic data set was made available as well as tasks. In this paper we describe some of the advances we have made from the first competition held in 2006.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4389032/","LOCKED","4389032","University of Massachusetts, Lowell. grinstein@cs.uml.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37360588500","1","Georges Grinstein","37360588500","University of Maryland. plaisant@cs.umd.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283026800","2","Catherine Plaisant","37283026800","National Institute of Standards and Technology. sharon.laskowski@nist.gov","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37837224000","3","Sharon Laskowski","37837224000","National Institute of Standards and Technology. toconnell@nist.gov","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37948663500","4","Theresa O'Connell","37948663500","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. jean.scholtz@pnl.com","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268671300","5","Jean Scholtz","37268671300","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. mark.a.whiting@pnl.gov","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37357067600","6","Mark Whiting","37357067600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7","0","30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","Sacramento, CA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2007.4389032","232","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4389032/","visual analytics","human information interaction","sense making","evaluation","metrics","contest","","Visual analytics","Laboratories","Graphical user interfaces","Data mining","Data analysis","Data visualization","Information services","Web sites","Internet","NIST","4388977","978-1-4244-1659-2","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-1659-2","07EX2042","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4389032","30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","4388976","2007 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2007","IEEE","19","231","VAST 2007 Contest - Blue Iguanodon"

This view is peppered with misperception.

"This article presents SpiralView, a visualization tool for helping system administrators to assess network policies. The tool is meant to be a complementary support to the routine activity of network monitoring, enabling a retrospective view on the alarms generated during and extended period of time. The tool permits to reason about how alarms distribute over time and how they correlate with network resources (e.g., users, IPs, applications, etc.), supporting the analysts in understanding how the network evolves and thus in devising new security policies for the future. The spiral visualization plots alarms in time, and, coupled with interactive bar charts and a users/applications graph view, is used to present network data and perform queries. The user is able to segment the data in meaningful subsets, zoom on specific related information, and inspect for relationships between alarms, users, and applications. In designing the visualizations and their interaction, and through tests with security experts, several ameliorations over the standard techniques have been provided.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4389007/","LOCKED","4389007","University of Fribourg. enrico.bertini@unifr.ch","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38267713800","1","Enrico Bertini","38267713800","NEXThink S.A. patrick.hertzog@nexthink.com","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37948939200","2","Patrick Hertzog","37948939200","University of Fribourg. denis.lalanne@unifr.ch","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37589762800","3","Denis Lalanne","37589762800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","21","0","30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","Sacramento, CA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2007.4389007","146","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4389007/","Network security","Intrusion Detection","Visualization","Data Exploration","","","","Data visualization","Intrusion detection","Monitoring","Data security","Information security","Spirals","Computer security","Telecommunication traffic","Engines","Computer interfaces","4388977","978-1-4244-1659-2","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-1659-2","07EX2042","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4389007","30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","4388976","2007 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2007","IEEE","25","139","SpiralView: Towards Security Policies Assessment through Visual Correlation of Network Resources with Evolution of Alarms"
"Information visualization leverages the human visual system to support the process of sensemaking, in which information is collected, organized, and analyzed to generate knowledge and inform action. Though most research to date assumes a single-user focus on perceptual and cognitive processes, in practice, sensemaking is often a social process involving parallelization of effort, discussion, and consensus building. This suggests that to fully support sensemaking, interactive visualization should also support social interaction. However, the most appropriate collaboration mechanisms for supporting this interaction are not immediately clear. In this article, we present design considerations for asynchronous collaboration in visual analysis environments, highlighting issues of work parallelization, communication, and social organization. These considerations provide a guide for the design and evaluation of collaborative visualization systems.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4389011/","LOCKED","4389011","University of California, Soda Hall, UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720-1776.

"Application of the ideas of visual analytics is a promising approach to supporting decision making, in particular, where the problems have geographic (or spatial) and temporal aspects. Visual analytics may be especially helpful in time-critical applications, which pose hard challenges to decision support. We have designed a suite of tools to support transportation-planning tasks such as emergency evacuation of people from a disaster- affected area. The suite combines a tool for automated scheduling based on a genetic algorithm with visual analytics techniques allowing the user to evaluate tool results and direct its work. A transportation schedule, which is generated by the tool, is a complex construct involving geographical space, time, and heterogeneous objects (people and vehicles) with states and positions varying in time.

"Large financial institutions such as Bank of America handle hundreds of thousands of wire transactions per day. Although most transactions are legitimate, these institutions have legal and financial obligations in discovering those that are suspicious. With the methods of fraudulent activities ever changing, searching on predefined patterns is often insufficient in detecting previously undiscovered methods. In this paper, we present a set of coordinated visualizations based on identifying specific keywords within the wire transactions. The different views used in our system depict relationships among keywords and accounts over time. Furthermore, we introduce a search-by-example technique which extracts accounts that show similar transaction patterns. In collaboration with the Anti-Money Laundering division at Bank of America, we demonstrate that using our tool, investigators are able to detect accounts and transactions that exhibit suspicious behaviors.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4389009/","LOCKED","4389009","UNC Charlotte. e-mail: rchang@uncc.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592409400","1","Remco Chang","37592409400","UNC Charlotte. e-mail: mghoniem@uncc.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37688563600","2","Mohammad Ghoniem","37688563600","UNC Charlotte. e-mail: rkosara@uncc.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282563400","3","Robert Kosara","37282563400","UNC Charlotte. e-mail: ribarsky@uncc.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300425000","4","William Ribarsky","37300425000","UNC Charlotte. e-mail: jyang13@uncc.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37292632600","5","Jing Yang","37292632600","UNC Charlotte. e-mail: easuma@uncc.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37297278600","6","Evan Suma","37297278600","UNC Charlotte. e-mail: caziemki@uncc.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37548028800","7","Caroline Ziemkiewicz","37548028800","Bank of America. e-mail: daniel.c.kern@bankofamerica.com","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37960273700","8","Daniel Kern","37960273700","Bank of America. e-mail: agus.sudjianto@bankofamerica.com","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37967877700","9","Agus Sudjianto","37967877700","","","","","","64","1","30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","Sacramento, CA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2007.4389009","162","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4389009/","Fraud detection","financial data visualization","categorial time-varying data","","","","","Data visualization","Wire","Law","Legal factors","Data mining","Collaborative tools","Computer graphics","Financial management","Risk management","Risk analysis","4388977","978-1-4244-1659-2","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-1659-2","07EX2042","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4389009","30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","4388976","2007 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2007","IEEE","28","155","WireVis: Visualization of Categorical, Time-Varying Data From Financial Transactions"
"Supporting visual analytics of multiple large-scale multidimensional datasets requires a high degree of interactivity and user control beyond the conventional challenges of visualizing such datasets. We present the DataMeadow, a visual canvas providing rich interaction for constructing visual queries using graphical set representations called DataRoses. A DataRose is essentially a starplot of selected columns in a dataset displayed as multivariate visualizations with dynamic query sliders integrated into each axis. The purpose of the DataMeadow is to allow users to create advanced visual queries by iteratively selecting and filtering into the multidimensional data. Furthermore, the canvas provides a clear history of the analysis that can be annotated to facilitate dissemination of analytical results to outsiders. Towards this end, the DataMeadow has a direct manipulation interface for selection, filtering, and creation of sets, subsets, and data dependencies using both simple and complex mouse gestures. We have evaluated our system using a qualitative expert review involving two researchers working in the area. Results from this review are favorable for our new method.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4389013/","LOCKED","4389013","INRIA/LRI, Univ.

IMAS displays the primary DNA sequence being analyzed by the biologist in a highly interactive, zoomable visual display. The user may analyze the sequence in a number of ways, and visualize these analyses in a coherent, sequence aligned form, with all related analysis products grouped together. This enables the user to rapidly perform analyses of DNA sequences without the need for tedious and error-prone cutting and pasting of sequence data from text files to and from web-based databases and data analysis services, as is now common practice.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4388997/","LOCKED","4388997","School of Interactive Arts & Technology, Simon Fraser University Surrey, Surrey, BC, Canada. shaw@sfu.ca","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37358198200","1","Christopher D.

"Cluster analysis (CA) is a powerful strategy for the exploration of high-dimensional data in the absence of a-priori hypotheses or data classification models, and the results of CA can then be used to form such models. But even though formal models and classification rules may not exist in these data exploration scenarios, domain scientists and experts generally have a vast amount of non-compiled knowledge and intuition that they can bring to bear in this effort. In CA, there are various popular mechanisms to generate the clusters, however, the results from their non- supervised deployment rarely fully agree with this expert knowledge and intuition. To this end, our paper describes a comprehensive and intuitive framework to aid scientists in the derivation of classification hierarchies in CA, using k-means as the overall clustering engine, but allowing them to tune its parameters interactively based on a non-distorted compact visual presentation of the inherent characteristics of the data in high- dimensional space. These include cluster geometry, composition, spatial relations to neighbors, and others. In essence, we provide all the tools necessary for a high-dimensional activity we call cluster sculpting, and the evolving hierarchy can then be viewed in a space-efficient radial dendrogram. We demonstrate our system in the context of the mining and classification of a large collection of millions of data items of aerosol mass spectra, but our framework readily applies to any high-dimensional CA scenario.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4388999/","LOCKED","4388999","Stony Brook University. email: ejnam@cs.sunysb.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37944542400","1","Eun Ju Nam","37944542400","Stony Brook University. email: yiping@cs.sunysb.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37836058500","2","Yiping Han","37836058500","Stony Brook University. email: mueller@cs.sunysb.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273119700","3","Klaus Mueller","37273119700","Pacific Northwest National Lab. email: alla.zelenyuk@pnl.gov","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945190700","4","Alla Zelenyuk","37945190700","Imre Consulting. email: dimre2b@charter.net","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37947994000","5","Dan Imre","37947994000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","35","0","30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","Sacramento, CA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2007.4388999","82","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4388999/","Visual Analytics","High-Dimensional Data","Visual Data Mining","Visualization in Earth","Space and Environmental Sciences","","","Visual analytics","Couplings","Analysis of variance","Shape measurement","Data mining","Displays","Clustering algorithms","Visualization","Space exploration","Iterative methods","4388977","978-1-4244-1659-2","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-1659-2","07EX2042","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4388999","30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","4388976","2007 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2007","IEEE","31","75","ClusterSculptor: A Visual Analytics Tool for High-Dimensional Data"
"Visualization systems traditionally focus on graphical representation of information. They tend not to provide integrated analytical services that could aid users in tackling complex knowledge discovery tasks. Users' exploration in such environments is usually impeded due to several problems: 1) valuable information is hard to discover when too much data is visualized on the screen; 2) Users have to manage and organize their discoveries off line, because no systematic discovery management mechanism exists; 3) their discoveries based on visual exploration alone may lack accuracy; 4) and they have no convenient access to the important knowledge learned by other users. To tackle these problems, it has been recognized that analytical tools must be introduced into visualization systems. In this paper, we present a novel analysis-guided exploration system, called the nugget management system (NMS). It leverages the collaborative effort of human comprehensibility and machine computations to facilitate users' visual exploration processes. Specifically, NMS first extracts the valuable information (nuggets) hidden in datasets based on the interests of users. Given that similar nuggets may be re-discovered by different users, NMS consolidates the nugget candidate set by clustering based on their semantic similarity. To solve the problem of inaccurate discoveries, localized data mining techniques are applied to refine the nuggets to best represent the captured patterns in datasets. Lastly, the resulting well-organized nugget pool is used to guide users' exploration. To evaluate the effectiveness of NMS, we integrated NMS into Xmd- vTool, a freeware multivariate visualization system. User studies were performed to compare the users' efficiency and accuracy in finishing tasks on real datasets, with and without the help of NMS.

"The task of building effective representations to visualize and explore collections with moderate to large number of documents is hard. It depends on the evaluation of some distance measure among texts and also on the representation of such relationships in bi- dimensional spaces. In this paper we introduce an alternative approach for building visual maps of documents based on their content similarity, through reconstruction of phylogenetic trees. The tree is capable of representing relationships that allows the user to quickly recover information detected by the similarity metric. For a variety of text collections of different natures we show that we can achieve improved exploration capability and more clear visualization of relationships amongst documents.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4389002/","LOCKED","4389002","Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computação, Universidade de São Paulo, São Carlos, Brazil. e-mail: anamaria@icmc.usp.br","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37946651100","1","Ana M.

"In this paper, we present a system to analyze activities and detect anomalies in a surveillance application, which exploits the intuition and experience of security and surveillance experts through an easy- to-use visual feedback loop. The multi-scale and location specific nature of behavior patterns in space and time is captured using a wavelet-based feature descriptor. The system learns the fundamental descriptions of the behavior patterns in a semi-supervised fashion by the higher order singular value decomposition of the space described by the training data. This training process is guided and refined by the users in an intuitive fashion. Anomalies are detected by projecting the test data into this multi-linear space and are visualized by the system to direct the attention of the user to potential problem spots. We tested our system on real-world surveillance data, and it satisfied the security concerns of the environment.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4388990/","LOCKED","4388990","Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University. e-mail: janoos@cse.ohio-state.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294440400","1","Firdaus Janoos","37294440400","Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University. e-mail: singhsh@cse.ohio-state.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37966484200","2","Shantanu Singh","37966484200","Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University. e-mail: irfanogl@cse.ohio-state.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37827945300","3","Okan Irfanoglu","37827945300","Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University. e-mail: raghu@cse.ohio-state.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37269516700","4","Raghu Machiraju","37269516700","Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University. e-mail: parent@cse.ohio-state.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37324916700","5","Richard Parent","37324916700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7","0","30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","Sacramento, CA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2007.4388990","10","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4388990/","wavelets","HOSVD","surveillance","anomaly detection","trajectory","","","Surveillance","Humans","Trajectory","System testing","Collaboration","Cameras","Application software","Data security","Computer vision","Feeds","4388977","978-1-4244-1659-2","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-1659-2","07EX2042","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4388990","30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","4388976","2007 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2007","IEEE","34","3","Activity Analysis Using Spatio-Temporal Trajectory Volumes in Surveillance Applications"
"In computer-based literary analysis different types of features are used to characterize a text. Usually, only a single feature value or vector is calculated for the whole text. In this paper, we combine automatic literature analysis methods with an effective visualization technique to analyze the behavior of the feature values across the text. For an interactive visual analysis, we calculate a sequence of feature values per text and present them to the user as a characteristic fingerprint. The feature values may be calculated on different hierarchy levels, allowing the analysis to be done on different resolution levels. A case study shows several successful applications of our new method to known literature problems and demonstrates the advantage of our new visual literature fingerprinting.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4389004/","LOCKED","4389004","University of Konstanz. e-mail: keim@inf.uni-konstanz.de","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","1","Daniel A.

This paper demonstrates a system that detects geo-temporal patterns and integrates story narration to increase analytic sense-making cohesion in GeoTime. The GeoTime geo-temporal event visualization tool was augmented with a story system that uses narratives, hypertext linked visualizations, visual annotations, and pattern detection to create an environment for analytic exploration and communication, thereby assisting the analyst in identifying, extracting, arranging and presenting stories within the data The story system lets analysts operate at the story level with higher-level abstractions of data, such as behaviors and events, while staying connected to the evidence.

"Investigative analysts who work with collections of text documents connect embedded threads of evidence in order to formulate hypotheses about plans and activities of potential interest. As the number of documents and the corresponding number of concepts and entities within the documents grow larger, sense-making processes become more and more difficult for the analysts. We have developed a visual analytic system called Jigsaw that represents documents and their entities visually in order to help analysts examine reports more efficiently and develop theories about potential actions more quickly. Jigsaw provides multiple coordinated views of document entities with a special emphasis on visually illustrating connections between entities across the different documents.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4389006/","LOCKED","4389006","School of Interactive Computing & GVU Center, Georgia Institute of Technology. e-mail: stasko@cc.gatech.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267736900","1","John Stasko","37267736900","School of Interactive Computing & GVU Center, Georgia Institute of Technology. e-mail: goerg@cc.gatech.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37428446300","2","Carsten Gorg","37428446300","School of Interactive Computing & GVU Center, Georgia Institute of Technology. e-mail: zcliu@cc.gatech.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592993600","3","Zhicheng Liu","37592993600","School of Interactive Computing & GVU Center, Georgia Institute of Technology. e-mail: ksinghal@cc.gatech.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37968367000","4","Kanupriya Singhal","37968367000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","68","1","30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","Sacramento, CA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2007.4389006","138","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4389006/","Visual analytics","investigative analysis","intelligence analysis","information visualization","multiple views","","","Information analysis","Performance analysis","Electronic mail","Visual analytics","Algorithm design and analysis","Costs","Embedded computing","Yarn","Data visualization","Information systems","4388977","978-1-4244-1659-2","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-1659-2","07EX2042","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4389006","30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","4388976","2007 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2007","IEEE","37","131","Jigsaw: Supporting Investigative Analysis through Interactive Visualization"
"Wikipedia is a wiki-based encyclopedia that has become one of the most popular collaborative on-line knowledge systems. As in any large collaborative system, as Wikipedia has grown, conflicts and coordination costs have increased dramatically. Visual analytic tools provide a mechanism for addressing these issues by enabling users to more quickly and effectively make sense of the status of a collaborative environment. In this paper we describe a model for identifying patterns of conflicts in Wikipedia articles. The model relies on users' editing history and the relationships between user edits, especially revisions that void previous edits, known as ""reverts"". Based on this model, we constructed Revert Graph, a tool that visualizes the overall conflict patterns between groups of users. It enables visual analysis of opinion groups and rapid interactive exploration of those relationships via detail drill- downs. We present user patterns and case studies that show the effectiveness of these techniques, and discuss how they could generalize to other systems.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4389010/","LOCKED","4389010","Palo Alto Research Center, 3333 Coyote Hill Road, Palo Alto, CA 94304.

"Large-scale session log analysis typically includes statistical methods and detailed log examinations. While both methods have merits, statistical methods can miss previously unknown sub- populations in the data and detailed analyses may have selection biases. We therefore built Session Viewer, a visualization tool to facilitate and bridge between statistical and detailed analyses. Taking a multiple-coordinated view approach, Session Viewer shows multiple session populations at the Aggregate, Multiple, and Detail data levels to support different analysis styles. To bridge between the statistical and the detailed analysis levels, Session Viewer provides fluid traversal between data levels and side-by-side comparison at all data levels.

In this paper we show that a visual analysis of the ""who revises whom""- network gives deep insight into controversies. We propose a set of analysis and visualization techniques that reveal the dominant authors of a page, the roles they play, and the alters they confront.

"Designing a visualization system capable of processing, managing, and presenting massive data sets while maximizing the user's situational awareness (SA) is a challenging, but important, research question in visual analytics. Traditional data management and interactive retrieval approaches have often focused on solving the data overload problem at the expense of the user's SA. This paper discusses various data management strategies and the strengths and limitations of each approach in providing the user with SA. A new data management strategy, coined Smart Aggregation, is presented as a powerful approach to overcome the challenges of both massive data sets and maintaining SA. By combining automatic data aggregation with user-defined controls on what, how, and when data should be aggregated, we present a visualization system that can handle massive amounts of data while affording the user with the best possible SA. This approach ensures that a system is always usable in terms of both system resources and human perceptual resources. We have implemented our Smart Aggregation approach in a visual analytics system called VIAssist (Visual Assistant for Information Assurance Analysis) to facilitate exploration, discovery, and SA in the domain of Information Assurance.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4388998/","LOCKED","4388998","Secure Decisions, a division of Applied Visions Inc. e-mail: dant@securedecisions.avi.com","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37708756000","1","Daniel R.

"Visualizations of large multi-dimensional data sets, occurring in scientific and commercial applications, often reveal interesting local patterns. Analysts want to identify the causes and impacts of these interesting areas, and they also want to search for similar patterns occurring elsewhere in the data set. In this paper we introduce the Intelligent Visual Analytics Query (IVQuery) concept that combines visual interaction with automated analytical methods to support analysts in discovering the special properties and relations of identified patterns. The idea of IVQuery is to interactively select focus areas in the visualization. Then, according to the characteristics of the selected areas, such as the data dimensions and records, IVQuery employs analytical methods to identify the relationships to other portions of the data set. Finally, IVQuery generates visual representations for analysts to view and refine the results. IVQuery has been applied successfully to different real-world data sets, such as data warehouse performance, product sales, and sever performance analysis, and demonstrates the benefits of this technique over traditional filtering and zooming techniques. The visual analytics query technique can be used with many different types of visual representation. In this paper we show how to use IVQuery with parallel coordinates, visual maps, and scatter plots.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4389001/","LOCKED","4389001","Hewlett Packard Laboratories, CA.

"In this paper, we have developed a novel framework to enable more effective investigation of large-scale news video database via knowledge visualization. To relieve users from the burdensome exploration of well-known and uninteresting knowledge of news reports, a novel interestingness measurement for video news reports is presented to enable users to find news stories of interest at first glance and capture the relevant knowledge in large-scale video news databases efficiently. Our framework takes advantage of both automatic semantic video analysis and human intelligence by integrating with visualization techniques on semantic video retrieval systems. Our techniques on intelligent news video analysis and knowledge discovery have the capacity to enable more effective visualization and exploration of large-scale news video collections. In addition, news video visualization and exploration can provide valuable feedback to improve our techniques for intelligent news video analysis and knowledge discovery.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4389003/","LOCKED","4389003","Software Engineering Institute, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China. e-mail: memcache@gmail.com","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275772500","1","Hangzai Luo","37275772500","Department of Computer Science, UNC-Charlotte, Charlotte, NC, USA. e-mail: jfan@uncc.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271216800","2","Jianping Fan","37271216800","Department of Computer Science, UNC-Charlotte, Charlotte, NC, USA. e-mail: jyang13@uncc.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37292632600","3","Jing Yang","37292632600","Department of Computer Science, UNC-Charlotte, Charlotte, NC, USA. e-mail: ribarsky@uncc.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300425000","4","William Ribarsky","37300425000","National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo, Japan. e-mail: satoh@nii.ac.jp","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266330000","5","Shin'ichi Satoh","37266330000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","14","0","30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","Sacramento, CA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2007.4389003","114","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4389003/","Semantic Video Classification","Knowledge Discovery","Knowledge Visualization","","","","","Large-scale systems","Visual databases","Visualization","Information retrieval","Broadcasting","Data mining","Multimedia communication","Artificial intelligence","USA Councils","Displays","4388977","978-1-4244-1659-2","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-1659-2","07EX2042","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4389003","30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","4388976","2007 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2007","IEEE","45","107","Analyzing Large-Scale News Video Databases to Support Knowledge Visualization and Intuitive Retrieval"
"An architecture for visualizing information extracted from text documents is proposed. In conformance with this architecture, a toolkit, FemaRepViz, has been implemented to extract and visualize temporal, geospatial, and summarized information from FEMA national update reports. Preliminary tests have shown satisfactory accuracy for FEMARepViz. A central component of the architecture is an entity extractor that extracts named entities like person names, location names, temporal references, etc. FEMARepViz is based on FactXtractor, an entity-extractor that works on text documents. The information extracted using FactXtractor is processed using GeoTagger, a geographical name disambiguation tool based on a novel clustering-based disambiguation algorithm. To extract relationships among entities, we propose a machine-learning based algorithm that uses a novel stripped dependency tree kernel. We illustrate and evaluate the usefulness of our system on the FEMA National Situation Updates. Daily reports are fetched by FEMARepViz from the FEMA website, segmented into coherent sections and each section is classified into one of several known incident types. We use concept Vista, Google maps and Google earth to visualize the events extracted from the text reports and allow the user to interactively filter the topics, locations, and time-periods of interest to create a visual analytics toolkit that is useful for rapid analysis of events reported in a large set of text documents.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4388991/","LOCKED","4388991","The Pennsylvania State University. e-mail: julianpan@psu.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37880213000","1","Chi-Chun Pan","37880213000","The Pennsylvania State University. e-mail: pmitra@ist.psu.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37286730000","2","Prasenjit Mitra","37286730000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","9","0","30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","Sacramento, CA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2007.4388991","18","","visual analytics","geo-temporal visualization","text processing","knowledge discovery","geospatial analytics","","","Visualization","Data mining","Visual analytics","Clustering algorithms","Earth","Information analysis","Decision making","Earthquakes","Tsunami","Decision support systems","4388977","978-1-4244-1659-2","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-1659-2","07EX2042","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4388991","30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","4388976","2007 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2007","IEEE","46","11","FemaRepViz: Automatic Extraction and Geo-Temporal Visualization of FEMA National Situation Updates"
"In this paper, we introduce NewsLab, an exploratory visualization approach for the analysis of large scale broadcast news video collections containing many thousands of news stories over extended periods of time. A river metaphor is used to depict the thematic changes of the news over time. An interactive lens metaphor allows the playback of fine-grained video segments selected through the river overview. Multi-resolution navigation is supported via a hierarchical time structure as well as a hierarchical theme structure. Themes can be explored hierarchically according to their thematic structure, or in an unstructured fashion using various ranking criteria. A rich set of interactions such as filtering, drill-down/roll-up navigation, history animation, and keyword based search are also provided. Our case studies show how this set of tools can be used to find emerging topics in the news, compare different broadcasters, or mine the news for topics of interest.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4389005/","LOCKED","4389005","UNC Charlotte. e-mail: mghoniem@uncc.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37688563600","1","Mohammad Ghoniem","37688563600","UNC Charlotte. e-mail: dluo2@uncc.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37545990500","2","Dongning Luo","37545990500","UNC Charlotte. e-mail: jyang13@uncc.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37292632600","3","Jing Yang","37292632600","UNC Charlotte. e-mail: ribarsky@uncc.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300425000","4","William Ribarsky","37300425000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12","0","30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","Sacramento, CA, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2007.4389005","130","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4389005/","Large data exploration","broadcast video analysis","time filtering","clustering","animation","comparative analysis","","Multimedia communication","Broadcasting","Rivers","Navigation","Visualization","Large-scale systems","Lenses","Filtering","History","Animation","4388977","978-1-4244-1659-2","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-1659-2","07EX2042","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4389005","30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2007","4388976","2007 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2007","IEEE","47","123","NewsLab: Exploratory Broadcast News Video Analysis"
"Coordinated animal-human health monitoring can provide an early warning system with fewer false alarms for naturally occurring disease outbreaks, as well as biological, chemical and environmental incidents. This monitoring requires the integration and analysis of multi-field, multi-scale and multi-source data sets. In order to better understand these data sets, models and measurements at different resolutions must be analyzed. To facilitate these investigations, we have created an application to provide a visual analytics framework for analyzing both human emergency room data and veterinary hospital data. Our integrated visual analytic tool links temporally varying geospatial visualization of animal and human patient health information with advanced statistical analysis of these multi-source data. Various statistical analysis techniques have been applied in conjunction with a spatio-temporal viewing window. Such an application provides researchers with the ability to visually search the data for clusters in both a statistical model view and a spatio-temporal view. Our interface provides a factor specification/filtering component to allow exploration of causal factors and spread patterns. In this paper, we will discuss the application of our linked animal-human visual analytics (LAHVA) tool to two specific case studies. The first case study is the effect of seasonal influenza and its correlation with different companion animals (e.g., cats, dogs) syndromes. Here we use data from the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC) and Banfield Pet Hospitals in an attempt to determine if there are correlations between respiratory syndromes representing the onset of seasonal influenza in humans and general respiratory syndromes in cats and dogs. Our second case study examines the effect of the release of industrial wastewater in a community through companion animal surveillance.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4388993/","LOCKED","4388993","Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center (PURVAC)","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396008400","1","Ross Maciejewski","37396008400","Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center (PURVAC)","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37945189900","2","Benjamin Tyner","37945189900","Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center (PURVAC)","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37557344300","3","Yun Jang","37557344300","Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center (PURVAC)","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37959894600","4","Cheng Zheng","37959894600","Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center (PURVAC)","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37397099000","5","Rimma V.
