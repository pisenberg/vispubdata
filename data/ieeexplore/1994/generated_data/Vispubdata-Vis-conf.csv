A geographic data map is used. Apparent power flow is encoded as the width of an arrow, with direction from real power flow. Flows are superposed on flow limits. Contour plots and color coding failed for representing bus voltages. A two-color thermometer encoding worked well. The resulting visualization is a significant improvement over current user interface practice in the power industry.<>",,P.M. Mahadev;R.D. Christie,"Dept. of Electr.

Rendering 3D models from such data is not straightforward due to the noisy, fuzzy nature of ultrasound imaging containing a lot of artefacts. We first apply speckle, median and gaussian prefiltering to improve the image quality. Using several semi-automatic segmentation tools we isolate interesting features within a few minutes. Our improved surface-extraction procedure enables volume rendering of high quality within a few seconds on a normal workstation, thus making the complete system suitable for routine clinical applications.<>",,G.

In recent years, computer graphics techniques have been applied to the task of visualizing such data. In particular, data visualization has been used to accomplish the virtual reconstruction of site architecture and to enable the display of spatial data distributions using three-dimensional models of site terrain. In the case we present here, these two approaches are integrated in the modeling of a prehistoric pithouse. In order to better visualize artifact distributions in the context of site architecture, surface data is displayed as a layer in a virtual reconstruction viewable at interactive rates. This integration of data display with the architectural model has proven valuable in identifying correlations between distributions of different artifact categories and their spatial proximity to significant architectural features.<>",,P.

In this algorithm, extrema points in a scalar field are first extracted. A graph is then generated in which the extrema points are taken as nodes. Each arc of the graph has a list of IDs of the cells that are intersected by the arc. A boundary cell list ordered according to cells' values is also generated. The graph and the list generated in this pre-process are used as a guide in searching for seed cells. Isosurfaces are generated from seed cells that are found in arcs of the graph. In this process, isosurfaces appear to propagate themselves. The algorithm visits only cells that are intersected by an isosurface and cells whose IDs an included in cell lists. It is especially efficient when many isosurfaces are interactively generated in a huge volume. Some benchmark tests described show the efficiency of the algorithm.<>",,T. Itoh;K. Koyamada,"Res.

Vis-conf,1994,Severe rainfall events in Northwestern Peru (visualization of scattered meteorological data),10.1109/VISUAL.1994.346298,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1994.346298,350,354,Conferences,"The ordinarily arid climate of coastal Peru is disturbed every few years by a phenomenon called El Nino, characterized by a warming in the Pacific Ocean. Severe rainstorms are one of the consequences of El Nino, which cause great damage. An examination of daily data from 66 rainfall stations in the Chiura-Piura region of northwestern Peru from late 1982 through mid-1983 (associated with an El Nino episode) yields information on the mesoscale structure of these storms. These observational data are typical of a class that are scattered at irregular locations in two dimensions. The use of continuous realization techniques for qualitative visualization (e.g., surface deformation or contouring) requires an intermediate step to define a topological relationship between the locations of data to form a mesh structure. Several common methods are considered, and the results of their application to the study of the rainfall events are analyzed.<>",,L.A. Treinish,"IBM Thomas J. Watson Res.

Plasma turbulence is very challenging from a theoretical point of view due to the nonlinearity and high dimensionality of the governing equations. Recent developments in algorithms along with the astounding advances in high performance computing now make first-principle particle simulations an important tool for improved understanding of such phenomena. Due to the five dimensional phase space (3 spatial, 2 velocity) and complex toroidal geometry, visualization is crucial for interpreting such simulation data. This paper discusses how visualization tools are currently used and what new physics has been elucidated, along with what can be learned about tokamak turbulence through the interplay between theory, simulation and visualization.<>",,S.E.

We present an algorithm that generates a PLS (piecewise linear surface) f', defined on a triangulation of the sample locations V={(x/sub i/, y/sub i/)/sub i=1//sup n/}, approximating f well. Constructing the PLS involves specifying both the triangulation of V and the values of f' at the points of V. We demonstrate that even when the sampling process is not noisy, a better approximation for f is obtained using our algorithm, compared to existing methods. This algorithm is useful for DTM (digital terrain map) manipulation by polygon-based graphics engines for visualization applications.<>",,M. Margaliot;C. Gotsman,"Dept. of Electr.

Streamballs are based upon implicit surface generation techniques adopted from the well-known metaballs. Their property to split or merge automatically in areas of significant divergence or convergence makes them an ideal tool for the visualization of arbitrary complex fields. Using convolution surfaces generated by continuous skeletons for streamball construction offers the possibility to visualize even tensor fields.<>,,M. Brill;H. Hagen;H.-C. Rodrian;W. Djatschin;S.V.

When using pseudocolor and animation to visualize data that contain missing regions displayed as black or transparent, the missing regions popping in and out can distract the viewer from the more relevant information. Filling these gaps with interpolated data could lead to a misinterpretation of the data. The paper presents a method for combining pseudocoloring and grayscale in the same colormap. Valid data are mapped to colors in the colormap. The luminance values of the colors bounding areas of missing data are used in interpolating over these regions. The missing data are mapped to the grayscale portion of the colormap. This approach has the advantages of eliminating distracting gaps caused by missing data and distinguishing between those areas that represent valid data and those areas that do not. This approach was inspired by a technique used in the restoration of paintings.<>",,R. Twiddy;J. Cavallo;S.M.

There are three levels of integration methods: rudimentary, operational and functional. The rudimentary approach uses the minimum amount of data sharing and exchange between these two technologies. The operational level attempts to provide consistency of the data while removing redundancies between the two technologies. The functional form attempts to provide transparent communication between these respective software environments. At this level, the user only needs to request information and the integrated system retrieves or generates the information depending upon the request. This paper examines the role and impact of these three levels of integration. Stepping further into the future, the paper also questions the long-term survival of these separate disciplines.<>",,T.M.

In Alaska alone, there are over 40 active volcanoes whose eruptions may affect more than 40,000 flights using the great circle polar routes each year. The clouds are especially problematic because they are invisible to radar and nearly impossible to distinguish from weather clouds. The Arctic Region Supercomputing Center and the Alaska Volcano Observatory have collaborated to develop a system for predicting and visualizing the movement of volcanic ash clouds when an eruption occurs. The output from the model is combined with a digital elevation model to produce a realistic view of the ash cloud which may be examined interactively from any desired point of view at any time during the prediction period.

We extract topological skeletons of the eigenvector fields, and we track their evolution over time. We study tensor topological transitions and correlate tensor and vector data. The basic constituents of tensor topology are the degenerate points, or points where eigenvalues are equal to each other. Degenerate points play a similar role as critical points in vector fields. We identify two kinds of elementary degenerate points, which we call wedges and trisectors. They can combine to form more familiar singularities-such as saddles, nodes, centers, or foci. However, these are generally unstable structures in tensor fields. Finally, we show a topological rule that puts a constraint on the topology of tensor fields defined across surfaces, extending to tensor fields the Poincare-Hopf theorem for vector fields.<>",,T.

Most data sets in scientific visualization, whether created by measurement or simulation, are usually voluminous. The goal of data management is to reduce the storage space and the access time of these data sets to speed up the visualization process. A new progressive transmission scheme using spline biorthogonal wavelet bases is proposed in this paper. By exploiting the properties of this set of wavelet bases, a fast algorithm involving only additions and subtractions is developed. Due to the multiresolutional nature of the wavelet transform, this scheme is compatible with hierarchical-structured rendering algorithms. The formula for reconstructing the functional values in a continuous volume space is given in a simple polynomial form. Lossless compression is possible, even when using floating-point numbers. This algorithm has been applied to data from a global ocean model. The lossless compression ratio is about 1.5:1. With a compression ratio of 50:1, the reconstructed data is still of good quality. Several other wavelet bases are compared with the spline biorthogonal wavelet bases.

Serial composition of data extraction tools is allowed, while each intermediate visualization object shares a common description and behavior. Visualization objects can be re-used, facilitating the data exploration process by expanding the available analysis and correlation functions provided. This design offers an open-ended architecture for the development of new visualization techniques. It promotes data and software re-use, eliminates the need for writing special purpose software and reduces processing requirements during interactive visualization sessions.<>",,J.M. Favre;J.

While our specific task is to produce a ""virtual geometry"" experience by approximating physically correct rendering of manifolds embedded in four dimensions, the general principles exploited by our approach reflect requirements common to many immersive virtual reality applications, especially those involving volume rendering. Among the issues we address are the classification of rendering tasks, the specialized hardware support required to attain interactivity, specific techniques required to render 4D objects, and interactive methods appropriate for our 4D virtual world application.<>",,R.A.
