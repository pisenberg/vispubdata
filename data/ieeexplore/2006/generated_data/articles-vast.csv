"Visual analytics experts realize that one effective way to push the field forward and to develop metrics for measuring the performance of various visual analytics components is to hold an annual competition. The first visual analytics science and technology (VAST) contest was held in conjunction with the 2006 IEEE VAST Symposium. The competition entailed the identification of possible political shenanigans in the fictitious town of Alderwood. A synthetic data set was made available as well as tasks. We summarize how we prepared and advertised the contest, developed some initial metrics for evaluation, and selected the winners. The winners were invited to participate at an additional live competition at the symposium to provide them with feedback from senior analysts","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035768/","LOCKED","4035768","University of Massachusetts Lowell, grinstein@cs.uml.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37360588500","1","Georges Grinstein","37360588500","National Institute of Standards and Technology, theresa.oconnell@nist.gov","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37948663500","2","Theresa O'Connell","37948663500","National Institute of Standards and Technology, sharon.laskowski@nist.gov","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37837224000","3","Sharon Laskowski","37837224000","University of Maryland, plaisant@cs.umd.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283026800","4","Catherine Plaisant","37283026800","Pacific Northwest, National Laboratory, jean.scholtz@pnl.com","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268671300","5","Jean Scholtz","37268671300","Pacific Northwest, National Laboratory, mark.a.whiting@pnl.gov","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37357067600","6","Mark Whiting","37357067600","","","","","","14","0","31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2006","Baltimore, MD, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2006.261420","216","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035768/","visual analytics","human information interaction","sense making","evaluation","metrics","contest","H.5.2 [Information Interfaces & Presentations]: User Interfaces - Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)","","","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Feedback","Laboratories","Cities and towns","Graphical user interfaces","Data analysis","IEEE news","NIST","Humans","4035730","1-4244-0592-0","CD","Historical","1-4244-0592-0","Print ISBN","Historical","1-4244-0591-2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4035768","31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2006","4035729","2006 IEEE Symposium On Visual Analytics Science And Technology","2006","IEEE","1","215","VAST 2006 Contest - A Tale of Alderwood"
"Spatio-temporal relationships among features extracted from temporally-varying scientific datasets can provide useful information about the evolution of an individual feature and its interactions with other features. However, extracting such useful relationships without user guidance is cumbersome and often an error prone process. In this paper, we present a visual analysis system that interactively discovers such relationships from the trajectories of derived features. We describe analysis algorithms to derive various spatial and spatio-temporal relationships. A visual interface is presented using which the user can interactively select spatial and temporal extents to guide the knowledge discovery process. We show the usefulness of our proposed algorithms on datasets originating from computational fluid dynamics. We also demonstrate how the derived relationships can help in explaining the occurrence of critical events like merging and bifurcation of the vortices","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035742/","LOCKED","4035742","Computer Science & Engineering, The Ohio State University, mehtas@cse.ohio-state.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275792500","1","Sameep Mehta","37275792500","Computer Science & Engineering, The Ohio State University, srini@cse.ohio-state.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37269057900","2","Srinivasan Parthasarathy","37269057900","Computer Science & Engineering, The Ohio State University, raghu@cse.ohio-state.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37269516700","3","Raghu Machiraju","37269516700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4","0","31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2006","Baltimore, MD, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2006.261451","18","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035742/","Knowledge Discovery","Scientific Analytics","Trajectory Analysis","Feature Extraction","Spatio-temporal Predicates","Visual Analytics","D.2.2 [Design Tools and Techniques]: User Interfaces","H.2.8 [Database Applications]: Data Mining","H.2.8 [Database Applications]: Scientific Databases","Data engineering","Computer science","Data mining","Merging","Bifurcation","Spatial databases","Visual databases","Feature extraction","Computational fluid dynamics","Visual analytics","4035730","1-4244-0592-0","CD","Historical","1-4244-0592-0","Print ISBN","Historical","1-4244-0591-2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4035742","31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2006","4035729","2006 IEEE Symposium On Visual Analytics Science And Technology","2006","IEEE","2","11","Visual Exploration of Spatio-temporal Relationships for Scientific Data"
"GeoTime and nSpace are new analysis tools that provide innovative visual analytic capabilities. This paper uses an epidemiology analysis scenario to illustrate and discuss these new investigative methods and techniques. In addition, this case study is an exploration and demonstration of the analytical synergy achieved by combining GeoTime's geo-temporal analysis capabilities, with the rapid information triage, scanning and sense-making provided by nSpace. A fictional analyst works through the scenario from the initial brainstorming through to a final collaboration and report. With the efficient knowledge acquisition and insights into large amounts of documents, there is more time for the analyst to reason about the problem and imagine ways to mitigate threats. The use of both nSpace and GeoTime initiated a synergistic exchange of ideas, where hypotheses generated in either software tool could be cross-referenced, refuted, and supported by the other tool","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035744/","LOCKED","4035744","Oculus Info Inc., email: pascale.proulx@oculusinfo.com","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604342500","1","Pascale Proulx","37604342500","Oculus Info Inc., email: sumeet.tandon@oculusinfo.com","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37823346300","2","Sumeet Tandon","37823346300","Oculus Info Inc., email: adam.bodnar@oculusinfo.com","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37830130500","3","Adam Bodnar","37830130500","Oculus Info Inc., email: david.schroh@oculusinfo.com","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37704437400","4","David Schroh","37704437400","Oculus Info Inc., email: rob.harper@oculusinfo.com","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37594531000","5","Robert Harper","37594531000","Oculus Info Inc., email: bill.wright@oculusinfo.com","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37654961400","6","William Wright","37654961400","","","","","","12","0","31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2006","Baltimore, MD, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2006.261427","34","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035744/","visual analytics","information visualization","human information interaction","sense making","geo-spatial information systems","temporal analysis","user centered design","","","Influenza","Information analysis","Visual analytics","Time series analysis","NIST","Performance analysis","Collaborative work","Graphical user interfaces","Visualization","Information retrieval","4035730","1-4244-0592-0","CD","Historical","1-4244-0592-0","Print ISBN","Historical","1-4244-0591-2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4035744","31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2006","4035729","2006 IEEE Symposium On Visual Analytics Science And Technology","2006","IEEE","3","27","Avian Flu Case Study with nSpace and GeoTime"
"Visualizing and analyzing social networks is a challenging problem that has been receiving growing attention. An important first step, before analysis can begin, is ensuring that the data is accurate. A common data quality problem is that the data may inadvertently contain several distinct references to the same underlying entity; the process of reconciling these references is called entity-resolution. D-Dupe is an interactive tool that combines data mining algorithms for entity resolution with a task-specific network visualization. Users cope with complexity of cleaning large networks by focusing on a small subnetwork containing a potential duplicate pair. The subnetwork highlights relationships in the social network, making the common relationships easy to visually identify. D-Dupe users resolve ambiguities either by merging nodes or by marking them distinct. The entity resolution process is iterative: as pairs of nodes are resolved, additional duplicates may be revealed; therefore, resolution decisions are often chained together. We give examples of how users can flexibly apply sequences of actions to produce a high quality entity resolution result. We illustrate and evaluate the benefits of D-Dupe on three bibliographic collections. Two of the datasets had already been cleaned, and therefore should not have contained duplicates; despite this fact, many duplicates were rapidly identified using D-Dupe's unique combination of entity resolution algorithms within a task-specific visual interface","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035746/","LOCKED","4035746","University of Maryland, College Park, MD. mbilgic@cs.umd.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37831461700","1","Mustafa Bilgic","37831461700","University of Maryland, College Park, MD. licamele@cs.umd.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37829618300","2","Louis Licamele","37829618300","University of Maryland, College Park, MD. getoor@cs.umd.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37829614900","3","Lise Getoor","37829614900","University of Maryland, College Park, MD. ben@cs.umd.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283016400","4","Ben Shneiderman","37283016400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","32","2","31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2006","Baltimore, MD, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2006.261429","50","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035746/","Data cleaning and integration","user interfaces","visual analytics","visual data mining","H.2.8 [Information Systems]: Database Applications¿Data mining","H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: User Interfaces¿User-centered design","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4035730","1-4244-0592-0","CD","Historical","1-4244-0592-0","Print ISBN","Historical","1-4244-0591-2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4035746","31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2006","4035729","2006 IEEE Symposium On Visual Analytics Science And Technology","2006","IEEE","4","43","D-Dupe: An Interactive Tool for Entity Resolution in Social Networks"

"Understanding the nature and dynamics of conflicting opinions is a profound and challenging issue. In this paper we address several aspects of the issue through a study of more than 3,000 Amazon customer reviews of the controversial bestseller The Da Vinci Code, including 1,738 positive and 918 negative reviews. The study is motivated by critical questions such as: what are the differences between positive and negative reviews? What is the origin of a particular opinion? How do these opinions change over time? To what extent can differentiating features be identified from unstructured text? How accurately can these features predict the category of a review? We first analyze terminology variations in these reviews in terms of syntactic, semantic, and statistic associations identified by TermWatch and use term variation patterns to depict underlying topics. We then select the most predictive terms based on log likelihood tests and demonstrate that this small set of terms classifies over 70% of the conflicting reviews correctly. This feature selection process reduces the dimensionality of the feature space from more than 20,000 dimensions to a couple of hundreds. We utilize automatically generated decision trees to facilitate the understanding of conflicting opinions in terms of these highly predictive terms. This study also uses a number of visualization and modeling tools to identify not only what positive and negative reviews have in common, but also they differ and evolve over time","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035748/","LOCKED","4035748","Drexel University, USA. e-mail: chaomei.chen@cis.drexel.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37280749300","1","Chaomei Chen","37280749300","Université de Lyon 3, France. e-mail: ibekwe@univ-lyon3.fr","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37830159400","2","Fidelia Ibekwe-SanJuan","37830159400","Université d'Avignon, France. e-mail: eric.sanjuan@lia-univ-avignon.fr","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37840812000","3","Eric SanJuan","37840812000","Penn State University, USA. e-mail: cew15@psu.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564883300","4","Chris Weaver","37564883300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","40","2","31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2006","Baltimore, MD, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2006.261431","66","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035748/","Visual analytics","conflicting opinions","terminology variation","decision tree","predictive text analysis","sense making","","","","Visual analytics","Chaos","Terminology","Decision trees","User interfaces","Pattern analysis","Statistical analysis","Testing","Visualization","Chromium","4035730","1-4244-0592-0","CD","Historical","1-4244-0592-0","Print ISBN","Historical","1-4244-0591-2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4035748","31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2006","4035729","2006 IEEE Symposium On Visual Analytics Science And Technology","2006","IEEE","6","59","Visual Analysis of Conflicting Opinions"
"Networks have remained a challenge for information retrieval and visualization because of the rich set of tasks that users want to accomplish. This paper offers an abstract content-actor network data model, a classification of tasks, and a tool to support them. The NetLens interface was designed around the abstract content-actor network data model to allow users to pose a series of elementary queries and iteratively refine visual overviews and sorted lists. This enables the support of complex queries that are traditionally hard to specify. NetLens is general and scalable in that it applies to any dataset that can be represented with our abstract data model. This paper describes NetLens applying a subset of the ACM Digital Library consisting of about 4,000 papers from the CM I conference written by about 6,000 authors.

"Extensive spread of malicious code on the Internet and also within intranets has risen the user's concern about what kind of data is transferred between her or his computer and other hosts on the network. Visual analysis of this kind of information is a challenging task, due to the complexity and volume of the data type considered, and requires special design of appropriate visualization techniques. In this paper, we present a scalable visualization toolkit for analyzing network activity of computer hosts on a network. The visualization combines network packet volume and type distribution information with geographic information, enabling the analyst to use geographic distortion techniques such as the HistoMap technique to become aware of the traffic components in the course of the analysis. The presented analysis tool is especially useful to compare important network load characteristics in a geographically aware display, to relate communication partners, and to identify the type of network traffic occurring. The results of the analysis are helpful in understanding typical network communication activities, and in anticipating potential performance bottlenecks or problems. It is suited for both off-line analysis of historic data, and via animation for on-line monitoring of packet-based network traffic in real time","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035756/","LOCKED","4035756","Databases, Data Mining and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz, Germany. keim@inf.uni-konstanz.de","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","1","Daniel A.

"Finding patterns of events over time is important in searching patient histories, Web logs, news stories, and criminal activities. This paper presents PatternFinder, an integrated interface for query and result-set visualization for search and discovery of temporal patterns within multivariate and categorical data sets. We define temporal patterns as sequences of events with inter-event time spans. PatternFinder allows users to specify the attributes of events and time spans to produce powerful pattern queries that are difficult to express with other formalisms. We characterize the range of queries PatternFinder supports as users vary the specificity at which events and time spans are defined. Pattern Finder's query capabilities together with coupled ball-and-chain and tabular visualizations enable users to effectively query, explore and analyze event patterns both within and across data entities (e.g. patient histories, terrorist groups, Web logs, etc.)","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035762/","LOCKED","4035762","Department of Computer Science & Human-Computer Interaction Lab, University of Maryland, A.

"Real-world data is known to be imperfect, suffering from various forms of defects such as sensor variability, estimation errors, uncertainty, human errors in data entry, and gaps in data gathering. Analysis conducted on variable quality data can lead to inaccurate or incorrect results. An effective visualization system must make users aware of the quality of their data by explicitly conveying not only the actual data content, but also its quality attributes. While some research has been conducted on visualizing uncertainty in spatio-temporal data and univariate data, little work has been reported on extending this capability into multivariate data visualization. In this paper we describe our approach to the problem of visually exploring multivariate data with variable quality. As a foundation, we propose a general approach to defining quality measures for tabular data, in which data may experience quality problems at three granularities: individual data values, complete records, and specific dimensions. We then present two approaches to visual mapping of quality information into display space. In particular, one solution embeds the quality measures as explicit values into the original dataset by regarding value quality and record quality as new data dimensions. The other solution is to superimpose the quality information within the data visualizations using additional visual variables. We also report on user studies conducted to assess alternate mappings of quality attributes to visual variables for the second method. In addition, we describe case studies that expose some of the advantages and disadvantages of these two approaches","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035764/","LOCKED","4035764","Computer Science Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, xiezx@cs.wpi.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37829093300","1","Zaixian Xie","37829093300","Computer Science Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, shiping@cs.wpi.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37557769100","2","Shiping Huang","37557769100","Computer Science Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, matt@cs.wpi.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268441700","3","Matthew O.

"During the last two decades a wide variety of advanced methods for the visual exploration of large data sets have been proposed. For most of these techniques user interaction has become a crucial element, since there are many situations in which a user or an analyst has to select the right parameter settings from among many or select a subset of the available attribute space for the visualization process, in order to construct valuable visualizations that provide insight, into the data and reveal interesting patterns. The right choice of input parameters is often essential, since suboptimal parameter settings or the investigation of irrelevant data dimensions make the exploration process more time consuming and may result in wrong conclusions. In this paper we propose a novel method for automatically determining meaningful parameter- and attribute settings based on the information content of the resulting visualizations. Our technique called Pixnostics, in analogy to Scagnostics (Wilkinson et al., 2005), automatically analyses pixel images resulting from diverse parameter mappings and ranks them according to the potential value for the user. This allows a more effective and more efficient visual data analysis process, since the attribute/parameter space is reduced to meaningful selections and thus the analyst obtains faster insight into the data. Real world applications are provided to show the benefit of the proposed approach","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035766/","LOCKED","4035766","University of Konstanz, Germany. schneide@inf.uni-konstanz.de","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37669961800","1","Jorn Schneidewind","37669961800","Stanford University, USA. ms@pixelmap.org","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37827860500","2","Mike Sips","37827860500","University of Konstanz, Germany. keim@inf.uni-konstanz.de","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","3","Daniel A.

"Intelligence analysis often involves the task of gathering information about an organization. Knowledge about individuals in an organization and their relationships, often represented as a hierarchical organization chart, is crucial for understanding the organization. However, it is difficult for intelligence analysts to follow all individuals in an organization. Existing hierarchy visualizations have largely focused on the visualization of fixed structures and can not effectively depict the evolution of a hierarchy over time. We introduce TimeTree, a novel visualization tool designed to enable exploration of a changing hierarchy. TimeTree enables analysts to navigate the history of an organization, identify events associated with a specific entity (visualized on a TimeSlider), and explore an aggregate view of an individual's career path (a CareerTree). We demonstrate the utility of TimeTree by investigating a set of scenarios developed by an expert intelligence analyst. The scenarios are evaluated using a real dataset composed of eighteen thousand career events from more than eight thousand individuals. Insights gained from this analysis are presented","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035741/","LOCKED","4035741","Palo Alto Research Center, 3333 Coyote Hill Road Palo Alto, CA 94304.

"Decade scale oceanic phenomena like El Nino are correlated with weather anomalies all over the globe. Only by understanding the events that produced the climatic conditions in the past will it be possible to forecast abrupt climate changes and prevent disastrous consequences for human beings and their environment. Paleoceanography research is a collaborative effort that requires the analysis of paleo time-series, which are obtained from a number of independent techniques and instruments and produced by a variety of different researchers and/or laboratories. The complexity of these phenomena that consist of massive, dynamic and often conflicting data can only be faced by means of analytical reasoning supported by a highly interactive visual interface.

"Understanding the space and time characteristics of human interaction in complex social networks is a critical component of visual tools for intelligence analysis, consumer behavior analysis, and human geography. Visual identification and comparison of patterns of recurring events is an essential feature of such tools. In this paper, we describe a tool for exploring hotel visitation patterns in and around Rebersburg, Pennsylvania from 1898-1900. The tool uses a wrapping spreadsheet technique, called reruns, to display cyclic patterns of geographic events in multiple overlapping natural and artificial calendars. Implemented as an improvise visualization, the tool is in active development through a iterative process of data collection, hypothesis, design, discovery, and evaluation in close collaboration with historical geographers. Several discoveries have inspired ongoing data collection and plans to expand exploration to include historic weather records and railroad schedules.

"A visual investigation involves both the examination of existing information and the synthesis of new analytic knowledge. This is a progressive process in which newly synthesized knowledge becomes the foundation for future discovery. In this paper, we present a novel system supporting interactive, progressive synthesis of analytic knowledge. Here we use the term ""analytic knowledge"" to refer to concepts that a user derives from existing data along with the evidence supporting such concepts. Unlike existing visual analytic-tools, which typically support only exploration of existing information, our system offers two unique features. First, we support user-system cooperative visual synthesis of analytic knowledge from existing data. Specifically, users can visually define new concepts by annotating existing information, and refine partially formed concepts by linking additional evidence or manipulating related concepts. In response to user actions, our system can automatically manage the evolving corpus of synthesized knowledge and its corresponding evidence. Second, we support progressive visual analysis of synthesized knowledge. This feature allows analysts to visually explore both existing knowledge and synthesized knowledge, dynamically incorporating earlier analytic conclusions into the ensuing discovery process. We have applied our system to two complex but very different analytic applications.

"Mobile devices are rapidly gaining popularity due to their small size and their wide range of functionality. With the constant improvement in wireless network access, they are an attractive option not only for day to day use. but also for in-field analytics by first responders in widespread areas. However, their limited processing, display, graphics and power resources pose a major challenge in developing effective applications. Nevertheless, they are vital for rapid decision making in emergencies when combined with appropriate analysis tools. In this paper, we present an efficient, interactive visual analytic system using a PDA to visualize network information from Purdue's Ross-Ade Stadium during football games as an example of in-held data analytics combined with text and video analysis. With our system, we can monitor the distribution of attendees with mobile devices throughout the stadium through their access of information and association/disassociation from wireless access points, enabling the detection of crowd movement and event activity. Through correlative visualization and analysis of synchronized video (instant replay video) and text information (play statistics) with the network activity, we can provide insightful information to network monitoring personnel, safety personnel and analysts. This work provides a demonstration and testbed for mobile sensor analytics that will help to improve network performance and provide safety personnel with information for better emergency planning and guidance","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035751/","LOCKED","4035751","Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center (PURVAC), Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN. e-mail: apattath@purdue.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37296890200","1","Avin Pattath","37296890200","Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center (PURVAC), Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN. e-mail: bbue@purdue.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37296901100","2","Brian Bue","37296901100","Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center (PURVAC), Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN. e-mail: jangy@purdue.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37557344300","3","Yun Jang","37557344300","Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center (PURVAC), Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN. e-mail: ebertd@purdue.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282598900","4","David Ebert","37282598900","Center for Wireless Systems and Applications (CWSA), Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN. e-mail: zhongx@purdue.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37290193000","5","Xuan Zhong","37290193000","Center for Wireless Systems and Applications (CWSA), Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN. e-mail: aultac@purdue.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37830267200","6","Aaron Ault","37830267200","Center for Wireless Systems and Applications (CWSA), Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN. e-mail: coyle@purdue.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273340400","7","Edward Coyle","37273340400","11","3","31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2006","Baltimore, MD, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2006.261434","90","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035751/","mobile visualization","network visualization","visual analytics","I.3.2 [Computer Graphics]: Graphics Systems¿Network Graphics","I.3.8 [Computer Graphics]: Applications¿Visual Analytics","","","","","Data visualization","Information analysis","Personnel","Monitoring","Safety","Displays","Graphics","Decision making","Visual analytics","Game theory","4035730","1-4244-0592-0","CD","Historical","1-4244-0592-0","Print ISBN","Historical","1-4244-0591-2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4035751","31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2006","4035729","2006 IEEE Symposium On Visual Analytics Science And Technology","2006","IEEE","19","83","Interactive Visualization and Analysis of Network and Sensor Data on Mobile Devices"
"A semantic graph is a network of heterogeneous nodes and links annotated with a domain ontology. In intelligence analysis, investigators use semantic graphs to organize concepts and relationships as graph nodes and links in hopes of discovering key trends, patterns, and insights. However, as new information continues to arrive from a multitude of sources, the size and complexity of the semantic graphs will soon overwhelm an investigator's cognitive capacity to carry out significant analyses. We introduce a powerful visual analytics framework designed to enhance investigators' natural analytical capabilities to comprehend and analyze large semantic graphs.

"Wormhole attacks in wireless networks can severely deteriorate the network performance and compromise the security through spoiling the routing protocols and weakening the security enhancements. This paper develops an approach, interactive visualization of wormholes (IVoW), to monitor and detect such attacks in large scale wireless networks in real time. We characterize the topology features of a network under wormhole attacks through the node position changes and visualize the information at dynamically adjusted scales. We integrate an automatic detection algorithm with appropriate user interactions to handle complicated scenarios that include a large number of moving nodes and multiple worm-hole attackers. Various visual forms have been adopted to assist the understanding and analysis of the reconstructed network topology and improve the detection accuracy. Extended simulation has demonstrated that the proposed approach can effectively locate the fake neighbor connections without introducing many false alarms. IVoW does not require the wireless nodes to be equipped with any special hardware, thus avoiding any additional cost. The proposed approach demonstrates that interactive visualization can be successfully combined with network security mechanisms to greatly improve the intrusion detection capabilities","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035753/","LOCKED","4035753","University of Kansas, e-mail: weichaow@eecs.ku.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37538916500","1","Weichao Wang","37538916500","University of North Carolina at Charlotte, e-mail: alul1@uncc.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37545504600","2","Aidong Lu","37545504600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6","0","31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2006","Baltimore, MD, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2006.261435","106","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035753/","Interactive Detection","Wormhole Attacks","Visualization on Network Security","Wireless Networks","Topology Visualization","C.2.0 [Computer-Communication Networks]: General¿Security and protection","H.5.2 [Information Systems]: Information Interfaces and Presentation¿User interfaces","","","Large-scale systems","Wireless networks","Visualization","Network topology","Routing protocols","Information security","Monitoring","Detection algorithms","Communication system security","Hardware","4035730","1-4244-0592-0","CD","Historical","1-4244-0592-0","Print ISBN","Historical","1-4244-0591-2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4035753","31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2006","4035729","2006 IEEE Symposium On Visual Analytics Science And Technology","2006","IEEE","21","99","Interactive Wormhole Detection in Large Scale Wireless Networks"
"Realizing operational analytics solutions where large and complex data must be analyzed in a time-critical fashion entails integrating many different types of technology. This paper focuses on an interdisciplinary combination of scientific data management and visualization/analysis technologies targeted at reducing the time required for data filtering, querying, hypothesis testing and knowledge discovery in the domain of network connection data analysis. We show that use of compressed bitmap indexing can quickly answer queries in an interactive visual data analysis application, and compare its performance with two alternatives for serial and parallel filtering/querying on 2.5 billion records' worth of network connection data collected over a period of 42 weeks. Our approach to visual network connection data exploration centers on two primary factors: interactive ad-hoc and multiresolution query formulation and execution over n dimensions and visual display of the n-dimensional histogram results. This combination is applied in a case study to detect a distributed network scan and to then identify the set of remote hosts participating in the attack. Our approach is sufficiently general to be applied to a diverse set of data understanding problems as well as used in conjunction with a diverse set of analysis and visualization tools","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035755/","LOCKED","4035755","Computational Research Division, e-mail: ewbethel@lbl.gov","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38550755500","1","E.

"We describe a framework for the display of complex, multidimensional data, designed to facilitate exploration, analysis, and collaboration among multiple analysts. This framework aims to support human collaboration by making it easier to share representations, to translate from one point of view to another, to explain arguments, to update conclusions when underlying assumptions change, and to justify or account for decisions or actions. Multidimensional visualization techniques are used with interactive, context-sensitive, and tunable graphs. Visual representations are flexibly generated using a knowledge representation scheme based on annotated logic; this enables not only tracking and fusing different viewpoints, but also unpacking them. Fusing representations supports the creation of multidimensional meta-displays as well as the translation or mapping from one point of view to another. At the same time, analysts also need to be able to unpack one another's complex chains of reasoning, especially if they have reached different conclusions, and to determine the implications, if any, when underlying assumptions or evidence turn out to be false. The framework enables us to support a variety of scenarios as well as to systematically generate and test experimental hypotheses about the impact of different kinds of visual representations upon interactive collaboration by teams of distributed analysts","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035757/","LOCKED","4035757","Stony Brook University, Psychology Department, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794-3300, susan.brennan@sunysb.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37840264500","1","Susan E.

"A great deal of analytical work is done in the context of reading, in digesting the semantics of the material, the identification of important entities, and capturing the relationship between entities. Visual analytic environments, therefore, must encompass reading tools that enable the rapid digestion of large amount of reading material. Other than plain text search, subject indexes, and basic highlighting, tools are needed for rapid foraging of text. In this paper, we describe a technique that presents an enhanced subject index for a book by conceptually reorganizing it to suit particular expressed user information needs. Users first enter information needs via keywords describing the concepts they are trying to retrieve and comprehend. Then our system, called ScentIndex, computes what index entries are conceptually related and reorganizes and displays these index entries on a single page. We also provide a number of navigational cues to help users peruse over this list of index entries and find relevant passages quickly. Compared to regular reading of a paper book, our study showed that users are more efficient and more accurate in finding, comparing, and comprehending material in our system","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035761/","LOCKED","4035761","Palo Alto Research Center, 3333 Coyote Hill Road, Palo Alto, CA 94304. echi@parc.com","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37448030800","1","Ed H.

"A new field of research, visual analytics, has been introduced. This has been defined as ""the science of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual interfaces"" (Thomas and Cook, 2005). Visual analytic environments, therefore, support analytical reasoning using visual representations and interactions, with data representations and transformation capabilities, to support production, presentation, and dissemination. As researchers begin to develop visual analytic environments, it is advantageous to develop metrics and methodologies to help researchers measure the progress of their work and understand the impact their work has on the users who work in such environments. This paper presents five areas or aspects of visual analytic environments that should be considered as metrics and methodologies for evaluation are developed. Evaluation aspects need to include usability, but it is necessary to go beyond basic usability. The areas of situation awareness, collaboration, interaction, creativity, and utility are proposed as the five evaluation areas for initial consideration. The steps that need to be undertaken to develop systematic evaluation methodologies and metrics for visual analytic environments are outlined","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035759/","LOCKED","4035759","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. e-mail: jean.scholtz@pnl.gov","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268671300","1","Jean Scholtz","37268671300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","30","0","31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2006","Baltimore, MD, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2006.261416","150","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035759/","visualization","analytic environments","metrics","","","","","","","Usability","Visual analytics","Visualization","Information analysis","Hardware","Speech recognition","Information retrieval","Humans","Production","Collaborative work","4035730","1-4244-0592-0","CD","Historical","1-4244-0592-0","Print ISBN","Historical","1-4244-0591-2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4035759","31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2006","4035729","2006 IEEE Symposium On Visual Analytics Science And Technology","2006","IEEE","25","145","Beyond Usability: Evaluation Aspects of Visual Analytic Environments"
"A variety of user interfaces have been developed to support the querying of hierarchical multi-dimensional data in an OLAP setting such as pivot tables and Polaris. They are used to regularly check portions of a dataset and to explore a new dataset for the first time. In this paper, we establish criteria for OLAP user interface capabilities to facilitate comparison. Two criteria are the number of displayed dimensions along which comparisons can be made and the number of dimensions that are viewable at once - visual comparison depth and width. We argue that interfaces with greater visual comparison depth support regular checking of known data by users that know roughly where to look, while interfaces with greater comparison width support exploration of new data by users that have no a priori starting point and need to scan all dimensions. Pivot tables and Polaris are examples of the former. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a new scalable interface that uses parallel dimension axis which supports the latter, greater visual comparison width. We compare our approach to both table based and parallel coordinate based interfaces. We present an implementation of our interface SGViewer, user scenarios and provide an evaluation that supports the usability of our interface","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035763/","LOCKED","4035763","School of Economics & Information Systems, University of Wollongong, Australia. msifer@uow.edu.au","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37347571400","1","Mark Sifer","37347571400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6","0","31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2006","Baltimore, MD, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2006.261422","182","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035763/","Data exploration","OLAP","visualization","parallel coordinates","","","","","","User interfaces","Marketing and sales","Polarization","Data mining","Data visualization","Data analysis","Information systems","Scattering","Usability","Chromium","4035730","1-4244-0592-0","CD","Historical","1-4244-0592-0","Print ISBN","Historical","1-4244-0591-2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4035763","31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2006","4035729","2006 IEEE Symposium On Visual Analytics Science And Technology","2006","IEEE","26","175","User Interfaces for the Exploration of Hierarchical Multi-dimensional Data"
"Browsing and retrieving images from large image collections are becoming common and important activities. Semantic image analysis techniques, which automatically detect high level semantic contents of images for annotation, are promising solutions toward this problem. However, few efforts have been made to convey the annotation results to users in an intuitive manner to enable effective image browsing and retrieval. There is also a lack of methods to monitor and evaluate the automatic image analysis algorithms due to the high dimensional nature of image data, features, and contents. In this paper, we propose a novel, scalable semantic image browser by applying existing information visualization techniques to semantic image analysis. This browser not only allows users to effectively browse and search in large image databases according to the semantic content of images, but also allows analysts to evaluate their annotation process through interactive visual exploration. The major visualization components of this browser are multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) based image layout, the value and relation (VaR) display that allows effective high dimensional visualization without dimension reduction, and a rich set of interaction tools such as search by sample images and content relationship detection. Our preliminary user study showed that the browser was easy to use and understand, and effective in supporting image browsing and retrieval tasks","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035765/","LOCKED","4035765","Dept of Computer Science, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, jyang13@uncc.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37292632600","1","Jing Yang","37292632600","Dept of Computer Science, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, jfan@uncc.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271216800","2","Jianping Fan","37271216800","Dept of Computer Science, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, dhubball@uncc.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300421500","3","Daniel Hubball","37300421500","Dept of Computer Science, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, ygao@uncc.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37404899900","4","Yuli Gao","37404899900","Dept of Computer Science, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, hluo@uncc.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275772500","5","Hangzai Luo","37275772500","Dept of Computer Science, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, ribarsky@uncc.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300425000","6","William Ribarsky","37300425000","Dept of Computer Science, Worcester Polytechnic, Institute. matt@cs.wpi.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268441700","7","Matthew Ward","37268441700","33","10","31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2006","Baltimore, MD, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2006.261425","198","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4035765/","Image retrieval","image layout","semantic image classification","multi-dimensional visualization","visual analytics","1.4.8 [Image Processing and Computer Vision]: Scene Analysis¿Object recognition","H.3.3 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Information Search and Retrieval¿Search process","H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: User Interfaces¿Graphical user interfaces","","Visualization","Image analysis","Image classification","Image retrieval","Information retrieval","Computerized monitoring","Image databases","Visual analytics","Computer science","Displays","4035730","1-4244-0592-0","CD","Historical","1-4244-0592-0","Print ISBN","Historical","1-4244-0591-2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4035765","31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2006","4035729","2006 IEEE Symposium On Visual Analytics Science And Technology","2006","IEEE","27","191","Semantic Image Browser: Bridging Information Visualization with Automated Intelligent Image Analysis"

"Visual analytics is a newly evolving field that spans across several more established disciplines. This panel discusses how VA system developers and researchers are best educated at the MS and PhD levels. This paper describes several ways in which VA can be characterized - with the goal of using these characterizations to identify knowledge domains that can be used to define VA curricula. Also, a digital library of VA educational resources is described","","EPHEMERA","4035767","Georgia Tech, foley@cc.gatech.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37286177900","1","James Foley","37286177900","PARC, card@parc.com","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37444594200","2","Stu Card","37444594200","Purdue, ebertd@ecn.purdue.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282598900","3","David Ebert","37282598900","Penn State, maceachren@psu.edu","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37374699000","4","A.

"The current metaphors used to justify visualization research involve the specters of massive information flows and analyst overload and such demands as ""connecting the dots"" and searching for ""nuggets"". Knowledge discovery becomes the challenge, and presenting the greatest amount of information to the bewildered user, or viewer in this case, the goal. Throughout history, however, visual metaphors have first and foremost helped humans organize and digest information. Irrelevant information or conceptions have been ignored or discarded. Customized or tailored interpretations have been put forward. What do I need to know? has been more crucial than What do I need to see? Designer information, just like ""designer drugs"" or designer ""genes"", is the watchword for visualization and analytics in this 21st Century. And one of its most rigorous applications is homeland security","","EPHEMERA","4035740","Science and Technology Dictorate, U.S. Department of Homeland Security","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37829627200","1","Joseph Kielman","37829627200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2006","Baltimore, MD, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2006.261449","ix","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4035730","1-4244-0592-0","CD","Historical","1-4244-0592-0","Print ISBN","Historical","1-4244-0591-2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4035740","31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2006","4035729","2006 IEEE Symposium On Visual Analytics Science And Technology","2006","IEEE","38","ix","Designer Information - Why Visualization and Analytics Technologies Should Help Us Focus Our Minds and Not Our Senses"
