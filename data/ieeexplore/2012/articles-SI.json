The visually guided exploration of turbulence features, including the interactive selection and simultaneous visualization of multiple features, can further progress our understanding of turbulence. Accomplishing this task for flow fields in which the full turbulence spectrum is well resolved is challenging on desktop computers. This is due to the extreme resolution of such fields, requiring memory and bandwidth capacities going beyond what is currently available. To overcome these limitations, we present a GPU system for feature-based turbulence visualization that works on a compressed flow field representation. We use a wavelet-based compression scheme including run-length and entropy encoding, which can be decoded on the GPU and embedded into brick-based volume ray-casting. This enables a drastic reduction of the data to be streamed from disk to GPU memory. Our system derives turbulence properties directly from the velocity gradient tensor, and it either renders these properties in turn or generates and renders scalar feature volumes. The quality and efficiency of the system is demonstrated in the visualization of two unsteady turbulence simulations, each comprising a spatio-temporal resolution of 10244. On a desktop computer, the system can visualize each time step in 5 seconds, and it achieves about three times this rate for the visualization of a scalar feature volume.","article_number":"6327475","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327475","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327475/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2169","end_page":"2177","citing_paper_count":18,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Graphics processing unit","Rendering (computer graphics)","Tensile stress","Vectors","Memory management","Encoding"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization system and toolkit design","vector fields","volume rendering","data streaming","data compression"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.269","title":"Surface-Based Structure Analysis and Visualization for Multifield Time-Varying Datasets","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":2,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38328697800","id":38328697800,"full_name":"Samer S.

Their success often depends on the ability to leverage capabilities of mathematical models, visualization, and human intuition through flexible, usable, and expressive interactions. Spatially clustering data is one effective metaphor for users to explore similarity and relationships between information, adjusting the weighting of dimensions or characteristics of the dataset to observe the change in the spatial layout. Semantic interaction is an approach to user interaction in such spatializations that couples these parametric modifications of the clustering model with users' analytic operations on the data (e.g., direct document movement in the spatialization, highlighting text, search, etc.). In this paper, we present results of a user study exploring the ability of semantic interaction in a visual analytic prototype, ForceSPIRE, to support sensemaking. We found that semantic interaction captures the analytical reasoning of the user through keyword weighting, and aids the user in co-creating a spatialization based on the user's reasoning and intuition.","article_number":"6327294","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327294","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327294/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327294/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2879","end_page":"2888","citing_paper_count":57,"citing_patent_count":1,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Semantics","User interfaces","Analytical models","Visual analytics","Mathematical model"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["User Interaction","visualization","sensemaking","analytic reasoning","visual analytics"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.216","title":"Effects of Stereo and Screen Size on the Legibility of Three-Dimensional Streamtube Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":7,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Maryland Baltimore County","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38107662400","id":38107662400,"full_name":"Jian Chen","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"University of Southern Mississippi","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490505100","id":38490505100,"full_name":"Haipeng Cai","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"University of Mississippi Medical Center","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489087400","id":38489087400,"full_name":"Alexander P.

The hypotheses were that (1) adding stereo and increasing display size would improve task accuracy and reduce completion time, and (2) the greater the complexity of a spatial task, the greater the benefits of an improved display. Thus we expected to see greater performance gains when detailed visual reasoning was required. Participants used dense streamtube visualizations to perform five representative tasks: (1) determine the higher average fractional anisotropy (FA) values between two regions, (2) find the endpoints of fiber tracts, (3) name a bundle, (4) mark a brain lesion, and (5) judge if tracts belong to the same bundle. Contrary to our hypotheses, we found the task completion time was not improved by the use of the larger display and that performance accuracy was hurt rather than helped by the introduction of stereo in our study with dense DMRI data. Bigger was not always better. Thus cautious should be taken when selecting displays for scientific visualization applications.

For the understanding and evaluation of the risk of rupture, the analysis of hemodynamic information plays an important role. Besides quantitative hemodynamic information, also qualitative flow characteristics, e.g., the inflow jet and impingement zone are correlated with the risk of rupture. However, the assessment of these two characteristics is currently based on an interactive visual investigation of the flow field, obtained by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) or blood flow measurements. We present an automatic and robust detection as well as an expressive visualization of these characteristics. The detection can be used to support a comparison, e.g., of simulation results reflecting different treatment options. Our approach utilizes local streamline properties to formalize the inflow jet and impingement zone. We extract a characteristic seeding curve on the ostium, on which an inflow jet boundary contour is constructed. Based on this boundary contour we identify the impingement zone. Furthermore, we present several visualization techniques to depict both characteristics expressively. Thereby, we consider accuracy and robustness of the extracted characteristics, minimal visual clutter and occlusions. An evaluation with six domain experts confirms that our approach detects both hemodynamic characteristics reasonably.","article_number":"6327222","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327222","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327222/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2178","end_page":"2187","citing_paper_count":17,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Aneurysm","Data visualization","Hemodynamics","Surface morphology","Rendering (computer graphics)"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Cerebral aneurysm","CFD","hemodynamic","visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.251","title":"Perception of Visual Variables on Tiled Wall-Sized Displays for Information Visualization Applications","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":9,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Univ Paris-Sud","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37413699200","id":37413699200,"full_name":"Anastasia Bezerianos","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"INRIA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591317800","id":37591317800,"full_name":"Petra Isenberg","author_order":2}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present the results of two user studies on the perception of visual variables on tiled high-resolution wall-sized displays.

We demonstrate the utility of this approach in two scientific scenarios and explain how it allowed scientists to gain new insight into the dynamics of environmental systems.","article_number":"6327296","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327296","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327296/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327296/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2899","end_page":"2907","citing_paper_count":24,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Time series analysis","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Meteorology","Entropy","Earth"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Time series analysis","multiscale visualization","visual analytics"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.283","title":"Visualization of Flow Behavior in Earth Mantle Convection","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":12,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Fraunhofer ITWM","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489665700","id":38489665700,"full_name":"Simon Schröder","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Department of Geology, University of California, Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38488843200","id":38488843200,"full_name":"John A.

Mixing can be used as a method to visualize and characterize flow. Because mixing is a process that occurs over time, it is a 4D problem that presents a challenge for computation, visualization, and analysis. Motivated by a mixing problem in geophysics, we introduce a combination of methods to analyze, transform, and finally visualize mixing in simulations of convection in a self-gravitating 3D spherical shell representing convection in the Earth's mantle. Geophysicists use tools such as the finite element model CitcomS to simulate convection, and introduce massless, passive tracers to model mixing. The output of geophysical flow simulation is hard to analyze for domain experts because of overall data size and complexity. In addition, information overload and occlusion are problems when visualizing a whole-earth model. To address the large size of the data, we rearrange the simulation data using intelligent indexing for fast file access and efficient caching. To address information overload and interpret mixing, we compute tracer concentration statistics, which are used to characterize mixing in mantle convection models. Our visualization uses a specially tailored version of Direct Volume Rendering. The most important adjustment is the use of constant opacity. Because of this special area of application, i. e. the rendering of a spherical shell, many computations for volume rendering can be optimized. These optimizations are essential to a smooth animation of the time-dependent simulation data. Our results show how our system can be used to quickly assess the simulation output and test hypotheses regarding Earth's mantle convection. The integrated processing pipeline helps geoscientists to focus on their main task of analyzing mantle homogenization.","article_number":"6327224","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327224","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327224/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327224/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2198","end_page":"2207","citing_paper_count":1,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Computational modeling","Data models","Rendering (computer graphics)","Geophysical measurements","Flow control","Earth"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Geophysics","flow visualization","tracer concentration","Earth mantle","convection","large data system"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.199","title":"Assessing the Effect of Visualizations on Bayesian Reasoning through Crowdsourcing","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":13,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"INRIA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490161300","id":38490161300,"full_name":"Luana Micallef","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"INRIA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590932700","id":37590932700,"full_name":"Pierre Dragicevic","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"INRIA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407972900","id":37407972900,"full_name":"Jean-Daniel Fekete","author_order":3}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"People have difficulty understanding statistical information and are unaware of their wrong judgments, particularly in Bayesian reasoning.

When selecting an alternative projection for information visualization, rivaling factors have to be taken into account, such as map scale, the geographic area shown, the map's height-to-width ratio, and the type of cartographic visualization. It is impossible for a single map projection to meet the requirements for all these factors. The proposed composite map projection combines several projections that are recommended in cartographic literature and seamlessly morphs map space as the user changes map scale or the geographic region displayed. The composite projection adapts the map's geometry to scale, to the map's height-to-width ratio, and to the central latitude of the displayed area by replacing projections and adjusting their parameters. The composite projection shows the entire globe including poles; it portrays continents or larger countries with less distortion (optionally without areal distortion); and it can morph to the web Mercator projection for maps showing small regions.","article_number":"6327263","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327263","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327263/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327263/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2575","end_page":"2582","citing_paper_count":30,"citing_patent_count":2,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Shape analysis","Continents","Mapping","Earth","Decision trees","Interpolation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Multi-scale map","web mapping","web cartography","web map projection","web Mercator","HTML5 Canvas"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.219","title":"Enterprise Data Analysis and Visualization: An Interview Study","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":15,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Stanford University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490119500","id":38490119500,"full_name":"Sean Kandel","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Stanford University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282105600","id":37282105600,"full_name":"Andreas Paepcke","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"University of California, Berkeley","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38183421000","id":38183421000,"full_name":"Joseph M.

During the modeling process, validation of the geoscientific model is an essential step. In validation, it is determined whether the model output shows sufficient agreement with observation data. Measures for this agreement are called goodness of fit. In the geosciences, analyzing the goodness of fit is challenging due to its manifold dependencies: 1) The goodness of fit depends on the model parameterization, whose precise values are not known. 2) The goodness of fit varies in space and time due to the spatio-temporal dimension of geoscientific models. 3) The significance of the goodness of fit is affected by resolution and preciseness of available observational data. 4) The correlation between goodness of fit and underlying modeled and observed values is ambiguous. In this paper, we introduce a visual analysis concept that targets these challenges in the validation of geoscientific models - specifically focusing on applications where observation data is sparse, unevenly distributed in space and time, and imprecise, which hinders a rigorous analytical approach. Our concept, developed in close cooperation with Earth system modelers, addresses the four challenges by four tailored visualization components. The tight linking of these components supports a twofold interactive drill-down in model parameter space and in the set of data samples, which facilitates the exploration of the numerous dependencies of the goodness of fit. We exemplify our visualization concept for geoscientific modeling of glacial isostatic adjustments in the last 100,000 years, validated against sea levels indicators - a prominent example for sparse and imprecise observation data. An initial use case and feedback from Earth system modelers indicate that our visualization concept is a valuable complement to the range of validation methods.","article_number":"6327226","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327226","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327226/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327226/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2216","end_page":"2225","citing_paper_count":19,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Analytical models","Data models","Geophysical measurements","Data visualization","Sea level","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Earth science visualization","model validation","coordinated multiple views","spatio-temporal visualization","sea level indicators"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.261","title":"Sketching Uncertainty into Simulations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":17,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38229386600","id":38229386600,"full_name":"Hrvoje Ribicic","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38111592300","id":38111592300,"full_name":"Juergen Waser","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"TU Wien","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489417000","id":38489417000,"full_name":"Roman Gurbat","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490409700","id":38490409700,"full_name":"Bernhard Sadransky","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"TU Wien","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282552200","id":37282552200,"full_name":"M.

Research focusing on this problem suggests that most user interfaces are too complex for the end user. Our goal is to let users create and investigate multiple, alternative scenarios without the need for special simulation expertise. To simplify the specification of parameters, we move from a traditional manipulation of numbers to a sketch-based input approach. Users steer both numeric parameters and parameters with a spatial correspondence by sketching a change onto the rendering. Special visualizations provide immediate visual feedback on how the sketches are transformed into boundary conditions of the simulation models. Since uncertainty with respect to many intertwined parameters plays an important role in planning, we also allow the user to intuitively setup complete value ranges, which are then automatically transformed into ensemble simulations. The interface and the underlying system were developed in collaboration with experts in the field of flood management. The real-world data they have provided has allowed us to construct scenarios used to evaluate the system. These were presented to a variety of flood response personnel, and their feedback is discussed in detail in the paper.

Radiologists for example are trained to read slices of medical imaging data. Despite the numerous examples of sophisticated 3D rendering techniques, domain experts, who still prefer slice-based visualization do not consider these to be very useful. Since 3D renderings have the advantage of providing an overview at a glance, while 2D depictions better serve detailed analyses, it is of general interest to better combine these methods. Recently there have been attempts to bridge this gap between 2D and 3D renderings. These attempts include specialized techniques for volume picking in medical imaging data that result in repositioning slices. In this paper, we present a new volume picking technique called WYSIWYP (“what you see is what you pick”) that, in contrast to previous work, does not require pre-segmented data or metadata and thus is more generally applicable. The positions picked by our method are solely based on the data itself, the transfer function, and the way the volumetric rendering is perceived by the user. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed method, we apply it to automated positioning of slices in volumetric scalar fields from various application areas. Finally, we present results of a user study in which 3D locations selected by users are compared to those resulting from WYSIWYP. The user study confirms our claim that the resulting positions correlate well with those perceived by the user.","article_number":"6327228","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327228","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327228/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2236","end_page":"2244","citing_paper_count":24,"citing_patent_count":2,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Transfer functions","Equations","Image color analysis","Biomedical imaging","Data visualization","Geometry"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Picking","volume rendering","WYSIWYG"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.280","title":"Visual Steering and Verification of Mass Spectrometry Data Factorization in Air Quality Research","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":20,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Kaiserslautern, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489527100","id":38489527100,"full_name":"Daniel Engel","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"University of Kaiserslautern, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489177000","id":38489177000,"full_name":"Klaus Greff","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"University of Kaiserslautern, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282573700","id":37282573700,"full_name":"Christoph Garth","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Air Quality Research Center (AQRC), University of California, Davis, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490554500","id":38490554500,"full_name":"Keith Bein","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"Air Quality Research Center (AQRC), University of California, Davis, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38227083700","id":38227083700,"full_name":"Anthony Wexler","author_order":5},{"affiliation":"Institute for Data Analysis and Visualization (IDAV), University of California, Davis, CA, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282068700","id":37282068700,"full_name":"Bernd Hamann","author_order":6},{"affiliation":"University of Kaiserslautern, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282578800","id":37282578800,"full_name":"Hans Hagen","author_order":7}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The study of aerosol composition for air quality research involves the analysis of high-dimensional single particle mass spectrometry data.

Social media, like Twitter, has been increasingly used for exchanging information, opinions and emotions about events that are happening across the world. Here we propose a novel visualization design, “Whisper”, for tracing the process of information diffusion in social media in real time. Our design highlights three major characteristics of diffusion processes in social media: the temporal trend, social-spatial extent, and community response of a topic of interest. Such social, spatiotemporal processes are conveyed based on a sunflower metaphor whose seeds are often dispersed far away. In Whisper, we summarize the collective responses of communities on a given topic based on how tweets were retweeted by groups of users, through representing the sentiments extracted from the tweets, and tracing the pathways of retweets on a spatial hierarchical layout. We use an efficient flux line-drawing algorithm to trace multiple pathways so the temporal and spatial patterns can be identified even for a bursty event. A focused diffusion series highlights key roles such as opinion leaders in the diffusion process. We demonstrate how our design facilitates the understanding of when and where a piece of information is dispersed and what are the social responses of the crowd, for large-scale events including political campaigns and natural disasters.

The first method, called APE (Adaptive Polynomial Encoder), uses a family of structured interpolating polynomials for prediction, while the second method, which we refer to as ACE (Adaptive Combined Encoder), combines predictors from previous work with the polynomial predictors to yield a more flexible, powerful encoder that is able to effectively decorrelate a wide range of data. In addition, in order to facilitate efficient visualization of compressed data, our scheme provides an option to partition floating-point values in such a way as to provide a progressive representation. We compare our two compressors to existing state-of-the-art lossless floating-point compressors for scientific data, with our data suite including both computer simulations and observational measurements. The results demonstrate that our polynomial predictor, APE, is comparable to previous approaches in terms of speed but achieves better compression rates on average.

In this paper we introduce graphical overlays-visual elements that are layered onto charts to facilitate a larger set of chart reading tasks. These overlays directly support the lower-level perceptual and cognitive processes that viewers must perform to read a chart. We identify five main types of overlays that support these processes; the overlays can provide (1) reference structures such as gridlines, (2) highlights such as outlines around important marks, (3) redundant encodings such as numerical data labels, (4) summary statistics such as the mean or max and (5) annotations such as descriptive text for context. We then present an automated system that applies user-chosen graphical overlays to existing chart bitmaps. Our approach is based on the insight that generating most of these graphical overlays only requires knowing the properties of the visual marks and axes that encode the data, but does not require access to the underlying data values. Thus, our system analyzes the chart bitmap to extract only the properties necessary to generate the desired overlay. We also discuss techniques for generating interactive overlays that provide additional controls to viewers. We demonstrate several examples of each overlay type for bar, pie and line charts.","article_number":"6327269","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327269","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327269/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327269/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2631","end_page":"2638","citing_paper_count":24,"citing_patent_count":3,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Encoding","Image color analysis","Data mining","Data visualization","Bars","Market research"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","overlays","graphical perception","graph comprehension"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.253","title":"RankExplorer: Visualization of Ranking Changes in Large Time Series Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":25,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38019494400","id":38019494400,"full_name":"Conglei Shi","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Aisa","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37391623900","id":37391623900,"full_name":"Weiwei Cui","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Aisa","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406039100","id":37406039100,"full_name":"Shixia Liu","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37069601700","id":37069601700,"full_name":"Panpan Xu","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"Zhe Jiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37291847800","id":37291847800,"full_name":"Wei Chen","author_order":5},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":6}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"For many applications involving time series data, people are often interested in the changes of item values over time as well as their ranking changes.

For very large time series data with thousands of items, how to visually present ranking changes is an interesting challenge. In this paper, we propose RankExplorer, a novel visualization method based on ThemeRiver to reveal the ranking changes. Our method consists of four major components: 1) a segmentation method which partitions a large set of time series curves into a manageable number of ranking categories; 2) an extended ThemeRiver view with embedded color bars and changing glyphs to show the evolution of aggregation values related to each ranking category over time as well as the content changes in each ranking category; 3) a trend curve to show the degree of ranking changes over time; 4) rich user interactions to support interactive exploration of ranking changes.

In contrast with the regular grid structure facilitated by volumetric data sets, as used in medicine or geosciences, FE models are defined over a non-uniform grid. Elements can have curved faces and their interior can be defined through high-order basis functions, which pose additional challenges when visualizing these models. During ray-casting, the uniformly distributed sample points along each viewing ray must be transformed into the material space defined within each element. The computational complexity of this transformation makes a straightforward approach inadequate for interactive data exploration. In this paper, we introduce a novel coherency-based method which supports the interactive exploration of FE models by decoupling the expensive world-to-material space transformation from the rendering stage, thereby allowing it to be performed within a precomputation stage. Therefore, our approach computes view-independent proxy rays in material space, which are clustered to facilitate data reduction. During rendering, these proxy rays are accessed, and it becomes possible to visually analyze high-order FE models at interactive frame rates, even when they are time-varying or consist of multiple modalities. Within this paper, we provide the necessary background about the FE data, describe our decoupling method, and introduce our interactive rendering algorithm. Furthermore, we provide visual results and analyze the error introduced by the presented approach.","article_number":"6327236","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327236","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327236/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2315","end_page":"2324","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Computational modeling","Finite element methods","Splines (mathematics)"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Finite element visualization","GPU-based ray-casting"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.231","title":"Hierarchical Exploration of Volumes Using Multilevel Segmentation of the Intensity-Gradient Histograms","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":27,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Maryland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586231900","id":37586231900,"full_name":"Cheuk Yiu Ip","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282560200","id":37282560200,"full_name":"Amitabh Varshney","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37276261200","id":37276261200,"full_name":"Joseph JaJa","author_order":3}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Visual exploration of volumetric datasets to discover the embedded features and spatial structures is a challenging and tedious task.

In volume visualization, direct volume rendering generates an informative image without external lighting, as each voxel itself emits radiance. However, external lighting further improves the shape and detail perception of features, and it also determines the effectiveness of the communication of feature information. The human visual system is highly effective in extracting structural information from images, and to assist it further, this paper presents an approach to structure-aware automatic lighting design by measuring the structural changes between the images with and without external lighting. Given a transfer function and a viewpoint, the optimal lighting parameters are those that provide the greatest enhancement to structural information - the shape and detail information of features are conveyed most clearly by the optimal lighting parameters. Besides lighting goodness, the proposed metric can also be used to evaluate lighting similarity and stability between two sets of lighting parameters. Lighting similarity can be used to optimize the selection of multiple light sources so that different light sources can reveal distinct structural information. Our experiments with several volume data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the structure-aware lighting design approach. It is well suited to use by novices as it requires little technical understanding of the rendering parameters associated with direct volume rendering.","article_number":"6327242","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327242","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327242/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327242/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2372","end_page":"2381","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Lighting","Measurement","Light sources","Rendering (computer graphics)","Entropy","Stability analysis","Shape analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Automatic lighting design","structural dissimilarity","lighting similarity","lighting stability","volume rendering"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.252","title":"PivotPaths: Strolling through Faceted Information Spaces","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":31,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Calgary","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590950400","id":37590950400,"full_name":"Marian Dörk","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Microsoft","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590950700","id":37590950700,"full_name":"Nathalie Henry Riche","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Microsoft","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38030407700","id":38030407700,"full_name":"Gonzalo Ramos","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Microsoft","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37871035200","id":37871035200,"full_name":"Susan Dumais","author_order":4}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present PivotPaths, an interactive visualization for exploring faceted information resources. During both work and leisure, we increasingly interact with information spaces that contain multiple facets and relations, such as authors, keywords, and citations of academic publications, or actors and genres of movies. To navigate these interlinked resources today, one typically selects items from facet lists resulting in abrupt changes from one subset of data to another. While filtering is useful to retrieve results matching specific criteria, it can be difficult to see how facets and items relate and to comprehend the effect of filter operations. In contrast, the PivotPaths interface exposes faceted relations as visual paths in arrangements that invite the viewer to `take a stroll' through an information space. PivotPaths supports pivot operations as lightweight interaction techniques that trigger gradual transitions between views. We designed the interface to allow for casual traversal of large collections in an aesthetically pleasing manner that encourages exploration and serendipitous discoveries. This paper shares the findings from our iterative design-and-evaluation process that included semi-structured interviews and a two-week deployment of PivotPaths applied to a large database of academic publications.","article_number":"6327277","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327277","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327277/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327277/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2709","end_page":"2718","citing_paper_count":83,"citing_patent_count":1,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Motion pictures","Layout","Navigation","Context","Information services","Facial animation"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Information visualization","interactivity","node-link diagrams","animation","information seeking","exploratory search"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.262","title":"Sketchy Rendering for Information Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":32,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"giCentre, City University London","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399045100","id":37399045100,"full_name":"Jo Wood","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"INRIA, Paris","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591317800","id":37591317800,"full_name":"Petra Isenberg","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"University of Groningen, Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37297057400","id":37297057400,"full_name":"Tobias Isenberg","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"giCentre, City University London","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37605079900","id":37605079900,"full_name":"Jason Dykes","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"INRIA, Paris","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37325862800","id":37325862800,"full_name":"Nadia Boukhelifa","author_order":5},{"affiliation":"giCentre, City University London","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590960700","id":37590960700,"full_name":"Aidan Slingsby","author_order":6}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present and evaluate a framework for constructing sketchy style information visualizations that mimic data graphics drawn by hand. We provide an alternative renderer for the Processing graphics environment that redefines core drawing primitives including line, polygon and ellipse rendering. These primitives allow higher-level graphical features such as bar charts, line charts, treemaps and node-link diagrams to be drawn in a sketchy style with a specified degree of sketchiness. The framework is designed to be easily integrated into existing visualization implementations with minimal programming modification or design effort. We show examples of use for statistical graphics, conveying spatial imprecision and for enhancing aesthetic and narrative qualities of visualization. We evaluate user perception of sketchiness of areal features through a series of stimulus-response tests in order to assess users' ability to place sketchiness on a ratio scale, and to estimate area. Results suggest relative area judgment is compromised by sketchy rendering and that its influence is dependent on the shape being rendered. They show that degree of sketchiness may be judged on an ordinal scale but that its judgement varies strongly between individuals. We evaluate higher-level impacts of sketchiness through user testing of scenarios that encourage user engagement with data visualization and willingness to critique visualization design. Results suggest that where a visualization is clearly sketchy, engagement may be increased and that attitudes to participating in visualization annotation are more positive. The results of our work have implications for effective information visualization design that go beyond the traditional role of sketching as a tool for prototyping or its use for an indication of general uncertainty.","article_number":"6327281","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327281","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327281/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327281/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2749","end_page":"2758","citing_paper_count":32,"citing_patent_count":1,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Shape analysis","Rendering (computer graphics)"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["NPR","non-photorealistic rendering","sketch","hand-drawn","uncertainty","visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.209","title":"Computing Morse-Smale Complexes with Accurate Geometry","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":33,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37870001700","id":37870001700,"full_name":"Attila Gyulassy","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564112000","id":37564112000,"full_name":"Peer-Timo Bremer","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284312600","id":37284312600,"full_name":"Valerio Pascucci","author_order":3}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Topological techniques have proven highly successful in analyzing and visualizing scientific data. As a result, significant efforts have been made to compute structures like the Morse-Smale complex as robustly and efficiently as possible. However, the resulting algorithms, while topologically consistent, often produce incorrect connectivity as well as poor geometry. These problems may compromise or even invalidate any subsequent analysis. Moreover, such techniques may fail to improve even when the resolution of the domain mesh is increased, thus producing potentially incorrect results even for highly resolved functions. To address these problems we introduce two new algorithms: (i) a randomized algorithm to compute the discrete gradient of a scalar field that converges under refinement; and (ii) a deterministic variant which directly computes accurate geometry and thus correct connectivity of the MS complex. The first algorithm converges in the sense that on average it produces the correct result and its standard deviation approaches zero with increasing mesh resolution. The second algorithm uses two ordered traversals of the function to integrate the probabilities of the first to extract correct (near optimal) geometry and connectivity. We present an extensive empirical study using both synthetic and real-world data and demonstrates the advantages of our algorithms in comparison with several popular approaches.","article_number":"6327205","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327205","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327205/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2014","end_page":"2022","citing_paper_count":24,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Geometry","Manifolds","Vectors","Algorithm design and analysis","Standards","Robustness","Topology"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Topology","topological methods","Morse-Smale complex"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.255","title":"RelEx: Visualization for Actively Changing Overlay Network Specifications","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":34,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of British Columbia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590945600","id":37590945600,"full_name":"Michael Sedlmair","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Bertrand AG, Munich","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490124000","id":38490124000,"full_name":"Annika Frank","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"University of British Columbia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349490300","id":37349490300,"full_name":"Tamara Munzner","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"University of Munich (LMU)","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37299644000","id":37299644000,"full_name":"Andreas Butz","author_order":4}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present a network visualization design study focused on supporting automotive engineers who need to specify and optimize traffic patterns for in-car communication networks.

We present the importance of designing the interactions and the visualization hand-in-hand in order to facilitate active learning. The outcome of this process is a fractal-based tree layout that reduces visual complexity while being able to capture all life on earth; a custom rendering and navigation engine that prioritizes visual appeal and smooth fly-through; and a multi-user interface that encourages collaborative exploration while offering guided discovery. We present an evaluation showing that the large dataset encouraged free exploration, triggers emotional responses, and facilitates visitor engagement and informal learning.","article_number":"6327285","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327285","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327285/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327285/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2789","end_page":"2798","citing_paper_count":30,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Collaboration","Layout","Navigation","Phylogeny","Rendering (computer graphics)","Data visualization","Information science"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Informal science education","collaborative learning","large tree visualizations","multi-touch interaction"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.242","title":"KnotPad: Visualizing and Exploring Knot Theory with Fluid Reidemeister Moves","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":41,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Indiana University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37559775500","id":37559775500,"full_name":"Hui Zhang","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University of Media and Communications, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37064918100","id":37064918100,"full_name":"Jianguang Weng","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489766500","id":38489766500,"full_name":"Lin Jing","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490597900","id":38490597900,"full_name":"Yiwen Zhong","author_order":4}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present KnotPad, an interactive paper-like system for visualizing and exploring mathematical knots; we exploit topological drawing and math-aware deformation methods in particular to enable and enrich our interactions with knot diagrams. Whereas most previous efforts typically employ physically based modeling to simulate the 3D dynamics of knots and ropes, our tool offers a Reidemeister move based interactive environment that is much closer to the topological problems being solved in knot theory, yet without interfering with the traditional advantages of paper-based analysis and manipulation of knot diagrams. Drawing knot diagrams with many crossings and producing their equivalent is quite challenging and error-prone. KnotPad can restrict user manipulations to the three types of Reidemeister moves, resulting in a more fluid yet mathematically correct user experience with knots. For our principal test case of mathematical knots, KnotPad permits us to draw and edit their diagrams empowered by a family of interactive techniques. Furthermore, we exploit supplementary interface elements to enrich the user experiences. For example, KnotPad allows one to pull and drag on knot diagrams to produce mathematically valid moves. Navigation enhancements in KnotPad provide still further improvement: by remembering and displaying the sequence of valid moves applied during the entire interaction, KnotPad allows a much cleaner exploratory interface for the user to analyze and study knot equivalence. All these methods combine to reveal the complex spatial relationships of knot diagrams with a mathematically true and rich user experience.","article_number":"6327209","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327209","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327209/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2051","end_page":"2060","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Mice","Rendering (computer graphics)","Shape","Haptic interfaces","Media","User interfaces"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Knot Theory","Math Visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.278","title":"Visual Data Analysis as an Integral Part of Environmental Management","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":42,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279771900","id":37279771900,"full_name":"Joerg Meyer","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38550755500","id":38550755500,"full_name":"E.

Based on this foundation we provide definitions, propose a methodological framework, and provide practical guidance for conducting design studies. We define a design study as a project in which visualization researchers analyze a specific real-world problem faced by domain experts, design a visualization system that supports solving this problem, validate the design, and reflect about lessons learned in order to refine visualization design guidelines. We characterize two axes - a task clarity axis from fuzzy to crisp and an information location axis from the domain expert's head to the computer - and use these axes to reason about design study contributions, their suitability, and uniqueness from other approaches. The proposed methodological framework consists of 9 stages: learn, winnow, cast, discover, design, implement, deploy, reflect, and write. For each stage we provide practical guidance and outline potential pitfalls. We also conducted an extensive literature survey of related methodological approaches that involve a significant amount of qualitative field work, and compare design study methodology to that of ethnography, grounded theory, and action research.","article_number":"6327248","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327248","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327248/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327248/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2431","end_page":"2440","citing_paper_count":266,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Collaboration","Design methodology","Visualization","Algorithm design and analysis","Logic gates"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Design study","methodology","visualization","framework"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.286","title":"Visualizing Network Traffic to Understand the Performance of Massively Parallel Simulations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":44,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490116900","id":38490116900,"full_name":"Aaditya G.

This paper applies visualization techniques to aid parallel application developers in understanding the network activity by enabling a detailed exploration of the flow of packets through the hardware interconnect. In order to visualize this large and complex data, we employ two linked views of the hardware network. The first is a 2D view, that represents the network structure as one of several simplified planar projections. This view is designed to allow a user to easily identify trends and patterns in the network traffic. The second is a 3D view that augments the 2D view by preserving the physical network topology and providing a context that is familiar to the application developers.

However, the scalability and readability of this method are limited when dealing with large and dense tables. In this paper we present Contingency Wheel++, new visual analytics methods that overcome these major shortcomings: (1) regarding automated methods, a measure of association based on Pearson's residuals alleviates the bias of the raw residuals originally used, (2) regarding visualization methods, a frequency-based abstraction of the visual elements eliminates overlapping and makes analyzing both positive and negative associations possible, and (3) regarding the interactive exploration environment, a multi-level overview+detail interface enables exploring individual data items that are aggregated in the visualization or in the table using coordinated views.

This makes the human brain and sensory system the only truly appropriate evaluation platform for evaluating and fine-tuning a new visualization method or paradigm. However, getting humans to volunteer for these purposes has always been a significant obstacle, and thus this phase of the development process has traditionally formed a bottleneck, slowing down progress in visualization research. We propose to take advantage of the newly emerging field of Human Computation (HC) to overcome these challenges. HC promotes the idea that rather than considering humans as users of the computational system, they can be made part of a hybrid computational loop consisting of traditional computation resources and the human brain and sensory system. This approach is particularly successful in cases where part of the computational problem is considered intractable using known computer algorithms but is trivial to common sense human knowledge. In this paper, we focus on HC from the perspective of solving visualization problems and also outline a framework by which humans can be easily seduced to volunteer their HC resources. We introduce a purpose-driven game titled “Disguise” which serves as a prototypical example for how the evaluation of visualization algorithms can be mapped into a fun and addicting activity, allowing this task to be accomplished in an extensive yet cost effective way. Finally, we sketch out a framework that transcends from the pure evaluation of existing visualization methods to the design of a new one.","article_number":"6327215","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327215","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327215/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327215/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2104","end_page":"2113","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Decision support systems","Handheld computers","Human factors","Color","Games","Computation theory"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Human computation","perception","evaluation","color blending"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.238","title":"Interactive Level-of-Detail Rendering of Large Graphs","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":48,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Uni Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489526500","id":38489526500,"full_name":"Michael Zinsmaier","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Uni Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550836200","id":37550836200,"full_name":"Ulrik Brandes","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Uni Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266781000","id":37266781000,"full_name":"Oliver Deussen","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Uni Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38108845300","id":38108845300,"full_name":"Hendrik Strobelt","author_order":4}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We propose a technique that allows straight-line graph drawings to be rendered interactively with adjustable level of detail.

However, users desire more expressive forms of interaction to influence clustering outcomes. In our experiences working with diverse application scientists, we have identified an interaction style scatter/gather clustering that helps users iteratively restructure clustering results to meet their expectations. As the names indicate, scatter and gather are dual primitives that describe whether clusters in a current segmentation should be broken up further or, alternatively, brought back together. By combining scatter and gather operations in a single step, we support very expressive dynamic restructurings of data. Scatter/gather clustering is implemented using a nonlinear optimization framework that achieves both locality of clusters and satisfaction of user-supplied constraints. We illustrate the use of our scatter/gather clustering approach in a visual analytic application to study baffle shapes in the bat biosonar (ears and nose) system. We demonstrate how domain experts are adept at supplying scatter/gather constraints, and how our framework incorporates these constraints effectively without requiring numerous instance-level constraints.","article_number":"6327289","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327289","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327289/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327289/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2829","end_page":"2838","citing_paper_count":16,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Clustering algorithms","Visual analytics","Optimization","Computer science","Linear programming","Algorithm design and analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Scatter/gather clustering","alternative clustering","constrained clustering"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.224","title":"Examining the Use of a Visual Analytics System for Sensemaking Tasks: Case Studies with Domain Experts","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":50,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Google Inc.","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37673524700","id":37673524700,"full_name":"Youn-ah Kang","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267736900","id":37267736900,"full_name":"John Stasko","author_order":2}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"While the formal evaluation of systems in visual analytics is still relatively uncommon, particularly rare are case studies of prolonged system use by domain analysts working with their own data.

Other more advanced methods have also been proposed, but the problem is still far from being solved. Here we present an alternative to these existing methods specifically devised to avoid false colors and preserve visual depth ordering. Our approach is data driven and follows the recently formulated knowledge-assisted visualization (KAV) paradigm. Preference data, that have been gathered in web-based user surveys, are used to train a support-vector machine model for automatically predicting an optimized hue-preserving blending. We have applied the resulting model to both volume rendering and a specific information visualization technique, illustrative parallel coordinate plots. Comparative renderings show a significant improvement over previous approaches in the sense that false colors are completely removed and important properties such as depth ordering and blending vividness are better preserved. Due to the generality of the defined data-driven blending operator, it can be easily integrated also into other visualization frameworks.","article_number":"6327217","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327217","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327217/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2122","end_page":"2129","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image color analysis","Color","Standards","Rendering (computer graphics)","Vectors","Support vector machines"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Color blending","hue preservation","knowledge-assisted visualization","volume rendering","parallel coordinates"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.243","title":"Lagrangian Coherent Structures for Design Analysis of Revolving Doors","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":52,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"ETH Zurich","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38102461400","id":38102461400,"full_name":"Benjamin Schindler","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"ETH Zurich","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38099765400","id":38099765400,"full_name":"Raphael Fuchs","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Air Flow Consulting AG Zurich","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489598400","id":38489598400,"full_name":"Stefan Barp","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38111592300","id":38111592300,"full_name":"Jürgen Waser","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"University of Bergen","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233238000","id":38233238000,"full_name":"Armin Pobitzer","author_order":5},{"affiliation":"ETH Zurich","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233238600","id":38233238600,"full_name":"Robert Carnecky","author_order":6},{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086889447","id":37086889447,"full_name":"Krešimir Matković","author_order":7},{"affiliation":"ETH Zurich","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282541100","id":37282541100,"full_name":"Ronald Peikert","author_order":8}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Room air flow and air exchange are important aspects for the design of energy-efficient buildings. As a result, simulations are increasingly used prior to construction to achieve an energy-efficient design. We present a visual analysis of air flow generated at building entrances, which uses a combination of revolving doors and air curtains. The resulting flow pattern is challenging because of two interacting flow patterns: On the one hand, the revolving door acts as a pump, on the other hand, the air curtain creates a layer of uniformly moving warm air between the interior of the building and the revolving door. Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS), which by definition are flow barriers, are the method of choice for visualizing the separation and recirculation behavior of warm and cold air flow. The extraction of LCS is based on the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) and makes use of a ridge definition which is consistent with the concept of weak LCS. Both FTLE computation and ridge extraction are done in a robust and efficient way by making use of the fast Fourier transform for computing scale-space derivatives.","article_number":"6327221","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327221","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327221/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327221/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2159","end_page":"2168","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Flow control","Atmospheric modeling","Tensile stress","Lyapunov methods","Energy efficiency","Meteorology","Heating"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization in physical sciences and engineering","topology-based techniques","vector field data"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.207","title":"Comparing Clusterings Using Bertin's Idea","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":53,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Augsburg","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489815800","id":38489815800,"full_name":"Alexander Pilhöfer","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"University of Augsburg","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37063335000","id":37063335000,"full_name":"Alexander Gribov","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"University of Augsburg","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489067600","id":38489067600,"full_name":"Antony Unwin","author_order":3}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Classifying a set of objects into clusters can be done in numerous ways, producing different results. They can be visually compared using contingency tables [27], mosaicplots [13], fluctuation diagrams [15], tableplots [20] , (modified) parallel coordinates plots [28], Parallel Sets plots [18] or circos diagrams [19]. Unfortunately the interpretability of all these graphical displays decreases rapidly with the numbers of categories and clusterings. In his famous book A Semiology of Graphics [5] Bertin writes “the discovery of an ordered concept appears as the ultimate point in logical simplification since it permits reducing to a single instant the assimilation of series which previously required many instants of study”. Or in more everyday language, if you use good orderings you can see results immediately that with other orderings might take a lot of effort. This is also related to the idea of effect ordering [12], that data should be organised to reflect the effect you want to observe. This paper presents an efficient algorithm based on Bertin's idea and concepts related to Kendall's t [17], which finds informative joint orders for two or more nominal classification variables. We also show how these orderings improve the various displays and how groups of corresponding categories can be detected using a top-down partitioning algorithm. Different clusterings based on data on the environmental performance of cars sold in Germany are used for illustration. All presented methods are available in the R package extracat which is used to compute the optimized orderings for the example dataset.","article_number":"6327256","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327256","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327256/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2506","end_page":"2515","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Optimization","Graphics","Classification","Stress measurement","Clustering algorithms"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Order optimization","fluctuation diagrams","classification","seriation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.250","title":"Organizing Search Results with a Reference Map","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":54,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","full_name":"Arlind Nocaj","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","full_name":"Ulrik Brandes","author_order":2}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We propose a method to highlight query hits in hierarchically clustered collections of interrelated items such as digital libraries or knowledge bases.

Our solution covers space, time, and attribute values. Based on an analysis of relevant visualization tasks, we designed the visualization solution around the principle of stacking trajectory bands. The core of our approach is a hybrid 2D/3D display. A 2D map serves as a reference for the spatial context, and the trajectories are visualized as stacked 3D trajectory bands along which attribute values are encoded by color. Time is integrated through appropriate ordering of bands and through a dynamic query mechanism that feeds temporally aggregated information to a circular time display. An additional 2D time graph shows temporal information in full detail by stacking 2D trajectory bands. Our solution is equipped with analytical and interactive mechanisms for selecting and ordering of trajectories, and adjusting the color mapping, as well as coordinated highlighting and dedicated 3D navigation. We demonstrate the usefulness of our novel visualization by three examples related to radiation surveillance, traffic analysis, and maritime navigation.

Surface-rupturing earthquakes cut and move landforms which develop across active faults, producing characteristic surface displacements across the fault. Geometric models of faults and their associated surface displacements are commonly applied to reconstruct these offsets to enable interpretation of the observed topography. However, current 2D techniques are limited in their capability to convey both the three-dimensional kinematics of faulting and the incremental sequence of events required by a given reconstruction. Here we present a real-time system for interactive retro-deformation of faulted topography to enable reconstruction of fault displacement within a high-resolution (sub 1m/pixel) 3D terrain visualization. We employ geometry shaders on the GPU to intersect the surface mesh with fault-segments interactively specified by the user and transform the resulting surface blocks in realtime according to a kinematic model of fault motion. Our method facilitates a human-in-the-loop approach to reconstruction of fault displacements by providing instant visual feedback while exploring the parameter space. Thus, scientists can evaluate the validity of traditional point-to-point reconstructions by visually examining a smooth interpolation of the displacement in 3D. We show the efficacy of our approach by using it to reconstruct segments of the San Andreas fault, California as well as a graben structure in the Noctis Labyrinthus region on Mars.","article_number":"6327225","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327225","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327225/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327225/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2208","end_page":"2215","citing_paper_count":2,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image reconstruction","Terrain mapping","Surface topography","Surface reconstruction","Solid modeling","Rendering (computer graphics)"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Terrain rendering","interactive","fault simulation","mesh deformation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.193","title":"Algorithms for Labeling Focus Regions","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":61,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Universität Würzburg","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490470100","id":38490470100,"full_name":"Martin Fink","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Universität Würzburg","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017278900","id":38017278900,"full_name":"Jan-Henrik Haunert","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Universität Münster","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489531200","id":38489531200,"full_name":"André Schulz","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Universität Würzburg","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489875600","id":38489875600,"full_name":"Joachim Spoerhase","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"Universität Würzburg","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37398094700","id":37398094700,"full_name":"Alexander Wolff","author_order":5}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the problem of labeling point sites in focus regions of maps or diagrams. This problem occurs, for example, when the user of a mapping service wants to see the names of restaurants or other POIs in a crowded downtown area but keep the overview over a larger area. Our approach is to place the labels at the boundary of the focus region and connect each site with its label by a linear connection, which is called a leader. In this way, we move labels from the focus region to the less valuable context region surrounding it. In order to make the leader layout well readable, we present algorithms that rule out crossings between leaders and optimize other characteristics such as total leader length and distance between labels. This yields a new variant of the boundary labeling problem, which has been studied in the literature. Other than in traditional boundary labeling, where leaders are usually schematized polylines, we focus on leaders that are either straight-line segments or Bezier curves. Further, we present algorithms that, given the sites, find a position of the focus region that optimizes the above characteristics. We also consider a variant of the problem where we have more sites than space for labels. In this situation, we assume that the sites are prioritized by the user. Alternatively, we take a new facility-location perspective which yields a clustering of the sites. We label one representative of each cluster. If the user wishes, we apply our approach to the sites within a cluster, giving details on demand.","article_number":"6327264","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327264","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327264/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327264/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2583","end_page":"2592","citing_paper_count":26,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Clustering methods","Gravity","Ubiquitous computing","Labels","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Geospatial analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Focus+context techniques","data clustering","mobile and ubiquitous visualization","geographic/geospatial visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.259","title":"SeiVis: An Interactive Visual Subsurface Modeling Application","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":62,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"King Adbullah University of Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37846851700","id":37846851700,"full_name":"Thomas Höllt","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"SimVis GmbH, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017008700","id":38017008700,"full_name":"Wolfgang Freiler","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37846849900","id":37846849900,"full_name":"Fritz-M.

When exploiting hydrocarbon reservoirs, a detailed and credible model of the subsurface structures is crucial in order to minimize economic and ecological risks. Creating such a model is an inverse problem: reconstructing structures from measured reflection seismics. The major challenge here is twofold: First, the structures in highly ambiguous seismic data are interpreted in the time domain. Second, a velocity model has to be built from this interpretation to match the model to depth measurements from wells. If it is not possible to obtain a match at all positions, the interpretation has to be updated, going back to the first step. This results in a lengthy back and forth between the different steps, or in an unphysical velocity model in many cases. This paper presents a novel, integrated approach to interactively creating subsurface models from reflection seismics. It integrates the interpretation of the seismic data using an interactive horizon extraction technique based on piecewise global optimization with velocity modeling. Computing and visualizing the effects of changes to the interpretation and velocity model on the depth-converted model on the fly enables an integrated feedback loop that enables a completely new connection of the seismic data in time domain and well data in depth domain. Using a novel joint time/depth visualization, depicting side-by-side views of the original and the resulting depth-converted data, domain experts can directly fit their interpretation in time domain to spatial ground truth data. We have conducted a domain expert evaluation, which illustrates that the presented workflow enables the creation of exact subsurface models much more rapidly than previous approaches.","article_number":"6327227","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327227","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327227/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327227/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2226","end_page":"2235","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Cost function","Computational modeling","Data visualization","Biological system modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Seismic visualization","volume deformation","exploded views","seismic interpretation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.188","title":"A Perceptual-Statistics Shading Model","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":63,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Informatics, University of Bergen","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489116100","id":38489116100,"full_name":"Veronika Šoltészová","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Department of Informatics, University of Bergen","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37567685600","id":37567685600,"full_name":"Cagatay Turkay","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Faculty of Psychology, University of Bergen","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489546000","id":38489546000,"full_name":"Mark C.

The accuracy of surface perception can be measured and the influencing factors can be modified in order to decrease the error in perception. This paper presents a novel concept of how a perceptual evaluation of a visualization technique can contribute to its redesign with the aim of improving the match between the distal and the proximal stimulus. During analysis of data from previous perceptual studies, we observed that the slant of 3D surfaces visualized on 2D screens is systematically underestimated. The visible trends in the error allowed us to create a statistical model of the perceived surface slant. Based on this statistical model we obtained from user experiments, we derived a new shading model that uses adjusted surface normals and aims to reduce the error in slant perception. The result is a shape-enhancement of visualization which is driven by an experimentally-founded statistical model. To assess the efficiency of the statistical shading model, we repeated the evaluation experiment and confirmed that the error in perception was decreased. Results of both user experiments are publicly-available datasets.","article_number":"6327231","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327231","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327231/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2265","end_page":"2274","citing_paper_count":8,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Shape analysis","Observers","Mathematical model","Computational modeling","Surface reconstruction"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Shading","perception","evaluation","surface slant","statistical analysis"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.271","title":"Taxonomy-Based Glyph Design—with a Case Study on Visualizing Workflows of Biological Experiments","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":64,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Oxford","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489729700","id":38489729700,"full_name":"Eamonn Maguire","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"University of Oxford","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489532000","id":38489532000,"full_name":"Philippe Rocca-Serra","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"University of Oxford","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489722500","id":38489722500,"full_name":"Susanna-Assunta Sansone","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"University of Oxford","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37320294300","id":37320294300,"full_name":"Jim Davies","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"University of Oxford","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37280982800","id":37280982800,"full_name":"Min Chen","author_order":5}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Glyph-based visualization can offer elegant and concise presentation of multivariate information while enhancing speed and ease in visual search experienced by users.

To alleviate such limitations, we propose a new systematic process for glyph design by exploring the parallel between the hierarchy of concept categorization and the ordering of discriminative capacity of visual channels. We examine the feasibility of this approach in an application where there is a pressing need for an efficient and effective means to visualize workflows of biological experiments. By processing thousands of workflow records in a public archive of biological experiments, we demonstrate that a cost-effective glyph design can be obtained by following a process of formulating a taxonomy with the aid of computation, identifying visual channels hierarchically, and defining application-specific abstraction and metaphors.","article_number":"6327266","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327266","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327266/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2603","end_page":"2612","citing_paper_count":31,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Glyph design"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Glyph-based techniques","taxonomies","design methodologies","bioinformatics visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.226","title":"Facilitating Discourse Analysis with Interactive Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":65,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Toronto","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38024987300","id":38024987300,"full_name":"Jian Zhao","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"University of Toronto","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37395495900","id":37395495900,"full_name":"Fanny Chevalier","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"University of Ontario Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37669874100","id":37669874100,"full_name":"Christopher Collins","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"University of Toronto","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37394495600","id":37394495600,"full_name":"Ravin Balakrishnan","author_order":4}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"A discourse parser is a natural language processing system which can represent the organization of a document based on a rhetorical structure tree-one of the key data structures enabling applications such as text summarization, question answering and dialogue generation.

This kind of selection technique can be applied to particle datasets in several application domains.

This was confirmed in a formal, controlled user study in which we compared the more flexible CloudLasso technique to the standard cylinder-based selection technique.

Moreover, these dimensions have different characteristics and relations that result in sub-groups and/or hierarchies over the set of dimensions. Such structures lead to heterogeneity within the dimensions. Although the consideration of these structures is crucial for the analysis, most of the available analysis methods discard the heterogeneous relations among the dimensions. In this paper, we introduce the construction and utilization of representative factors for the interactive visual analysis of structures in high-dimensional datasets. First, we present a selection of methods to investigate the sub-groups in the dimension set and associate representative factors with those groups of dimensions. Second, we introduce how these factors are included in the interactive visual analysis cycle together with the original dimensions.

This system is designed to minimize visualization errors of these types of fields by querying the underlying finite element basis functions (e.g., high-order polynomials) directly, leading to pixel-exact representations of solutions and geometry. The system interacts with simulation data through runtime plugins, which only require users to implement a handful of operations fundamental to finite element solvers. The data in turn can be visualized through the use of cut surfaces, contours, isosurfaces, and volume rendering. These visualization algorithms are implemented using NVIDIA's OptiX GPU-based ray-tracing engine, which provides accelerated ray traversal of the high-order geometry, and CUDA, which allows for effective parallel evaluation of the visualization algorithms. The direct interface between ElVis and the underlying data differentiates it from existing visualization tools. Current tools assume the underlying data is composed of linear primitives; high-order data must be interpolated with linear functions as a result. In this work, examples drawn from aerodynamic simulations-high-order discontinuous Galerkin finite element solutions of aerodynamic flows in particular-will demonstrate the superiority of ElVis' pixel-exact approach when compared with traditional linear-interpolation methods. Such methods can introduce a number of inaccuracies in the resulting visualization, making it unclear if visual artifacts are genuine to the solution data or if these artifacts are the result of interpolation errors. Linear methods additionally cannot properly visualize curved geometries (elements or boundaries) which can greatly inhibit developers' debugging efforts. As we will show, pixel-exact visualization exhibits none of these issues, removing the visualization scheme as a source of uncertainty for engineers using ElVis.","article_number":"6327237","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327237","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327237/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327237/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2325","end_page":"2334","citing_paper_count":20,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Finite element methods","Isosurfaces","Polynomials","Geometry","Rendering (computer graphics)","Data models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["High-order finite elements","spectral/hp elements","discontinuous Galerkin","fluid flow simulation","cut surface extraction","contours","isosurfaces"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.232","title":"Historygrams: Enabling Interactive Global Illumination in Direct Volume Rendering using Photon Mapping","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":73,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"C-Research, Linköping University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38228659100","id":38228659100,"full_name":"Daniel Jönsson","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"C-Research, Linköping University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38230927900","id":38230927900,"full_name":"Joel Kronander","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"C-Research, Linköping University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295281400","id":37295281400,"full_name":"Timo Ropinski","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"C-Research, Linköping University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284192000","id":37284192000,"full_name":"Anders Ynnerman","author_order":4}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this paper, we enable interactive volumetric global illumination by extending photon mapping techniques to handle interactive transfer function (TF) and material editing in the context of volume rendering.

In direct volume rendering (DVR) the ability to explore volume data using parameter changes, such as editable TFs, is of key importance. Advanced global illumination techniques are in most cases computationally too expensive, as they prevent the desired interactivity. Our technique decreases the amount of computation caused by parameter changes, by introducing Historygrams which allow us to efficiently reuse previously computed photon media interactions. Along the viewing rays, we utilize properties of the light transport equations to subdivide a view-ray into segments and independently update them when invalid. Unlike segments of a view-ray, photon scattering events within the volumetric medium needs to be sequentially updated. Using our Historygram approach, we can identify the first invalid photon interaction caused by a property change, and thus reuse all valid photon interactions. Combining these two novel concepts, supports interactive editing of parameters when using volumetric photon mapping in the context of DVR. As a consequence, we can handle arbitrarily shaped and positioned light sources, arbitrary phase functions, bidirectional reflectance distribution functions and multiple scattering which has previously not been possible in interactive DVR.","article_number":"6327241","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327241","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327241/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327241/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2364","end_page":"2371","citing_paper_count":20,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Photonics","Lighting","Rendering (computer graphics)","Scattering","Volume measurement"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Volume rendering","photon mapping","global illumination","participating media"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.236","title":"Intelligent Graph Layout Using Many Users' Input","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":74,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Peking University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403856700","id":37403856700,"full_name":"Xiaoru Yuan","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Peking University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490517900","id":38490517900,"full_name":"Limei Che","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"AT&T Labs Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403239700","id":37403239700,"full_name":"Yifan Hu","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Peking University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489293500","id":38489293500,"full_name":"Xin Zhang","author_order":4}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new strategy for graph drawing utilizing layouts of many sub-graphs supplied by a large group of people in a crowd sourcing manner.

Given a scalar field f, our algorithm generates a simplified field g that provably admits only critical points from a constrained subset of the singularities of f, while guaranteeing a small distance ||f - g||∞ for data-fitting purpose. In contrast to previous algorithms, our approach is oblivious to the strategy used for selecting features of interest and allows critical points to be removed arbitrarily. When topological persistence is used to select the features of interest, our algorithm produces a standard ϵ-simplification. Our approach is based on a new iterative algorithm for the constrained reconstruction of sub- and sur-level sets. Extensive experiments show that the number of iterations required for our algorithm to converge is rarely greater than 2 and never greater than 5, yielding O(n log(n)) practical time performances. The algorithm handles triangulated surfaces with or without boundary and is robust to the presence of multi-saddles in the input. It is simple to implement, fast in practice and more general than previous techniques. Practically, our approach allows a user to arbitrarily simplify the topology of an input function and robustly generate the corresponding simplified function. An appealing application area of our algorithm is in scalar field design since it enables, without any threshold parameter, the robust pruning of topological noise as selected by the user. This is needed for example to get rid of inaccuracies introduced by numerical solvers, thereby providing topological guarantees needed for certified geometry processing. Experiments show this ability to eliminate numerical noise as well as validate the time efficiency and accuracy of our algorithm.

The procedure involves the injection of a contrast agent into the blood stream to increase the contrast between the blood vessels and the surrounding tissue in the image data. CTA is often visualized with Direct Volume Rendering (DVR) where the enhanced image contrast is important for the construction of Transfer Functions (TFs). For increased efficiency, clinical routine heavily relies on preset TFs to simplify the creation of such visualizations for a physician. In practice, however, TF presets often do not yield optimal images due to variations in mixture concentration of contrast agent in the blood stream. In this paper we propose an automatic, optimization-based method that shifts TF presets to account for general deviations and local variations of the intensity of contrast enhanced blood vessels. Some of the advantages of this method are the following. It computationally automates large parts of a process that is currently performed manually. It performs the TF shift locally and can thus optimize larger portions of the image than is possible with manual interaction. The method is based on a well known vesselness descriptor in the definition of the optimization criterion. The performance of the method is illustrated by clinically relevant CT angiography datasets displaying both improved structural overviews of vessel trees and improved adaption to local variations of contrast concentration.","article_number":"6327239","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327239","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327239/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2345","end_page":"2354","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Optimization","Data visualization","Rendering (computer graphics)","Blood vessels","Biomedical imaging"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Direct volume rendering","transfer functions","vessel visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.248","title":"Multivariate Data Analysis Using Persistence-Based Filtering and Topological Signatures","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":78,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489062800","id":38489062800,"full_name":"Bastian Rieck","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37298496400","id":37298496400,"full_name":"Hubert Mara","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38488927600","id":38488927600,"full_name":"Heike Leitte","author_order":3}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The extraction of significant structures in arbitrary high-dimensional data sets is a challenging task. Moreover, classifying data points as noise in order to reduce a data set bears special relevance for many application domains. Standard methods such as clustering serve to reduce problem complexity by providing the user with classes of similar entities. However, they usually do not highlight relations between different entities and require a stopping criterion, e.g. the number of clusters to be detected. In this paper, we present a visualization pipeline based on recent advancements in algebraic topology. More precisely, we employ methods from persistent homology that enable topological data analysis on high-dimensional data sets. Our pipeline inherently copes with noisy data and data sets of arbitrary dimensions. It extracts central structures of a data set in a hierarchical manner by using a persistence-based filtering algorithm that is theoretically well-founded. We furthermore introduce persistence rings, a novel visualization technique for a class of topological features-the persistence intervals-of large data sets. Persistence rings provide a unique topological signature of a data set, which helps in recognizing similarities.

The literature provides a large body of existing solutions that help users accomplish comparison tasks. These solutions are mostly of visual nature and custom-made for specific data. We ask the question if a more general support is possible by focusing on the interaction aspect of comparison tasks. As an answer to this question, we propose a novel interaction concept that is inspired by real-world behavior of people comparing information printed on paper. In line with real-world interaction, our approach supports users (1) in interactively specifying pieces of graphical information to be compared, (2) in flexibly arranging these pieces on the screen, and (3) in performing the actual comparison of side-by-side and overlapping arrangements of the graphical information. Complementary visual cues and add-ons further assist users in carrying out comparison tasks. Our concept and the integrated interaction techniques are generally applicable and can be coupled with different visualization techniques. We implemented an interactive prototype and conducted a qualitative user study to assess the concept's usefulness in the context of three different visualization techniques. The obtained feedback indicates that our interaction techniques mimic the natural behavior quite well, can be learned quickly, and are easy to apply to visual comparison tasks.","article_number":"6327278","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327278","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327278/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327278/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2719","end_page":"2728","citing_paper_count":29,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Data visualization","Shape","Layout","Animation","Navigation","Computers"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Interaction techniques","visual comparison","visualization","human-computer interaction","natural interaction"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.197","title":"An Empirical Study on Using Visual Embellishments in Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":80,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Science, Swansea University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591074800","id":37591074800,"full_name":"Rita Borgo","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Oxford e-Research Centre, Oxford University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489317800","id":38489317800,"full_name":"Alfie Abdul-Rahman","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489907300","id":38489907300,"full_name":"Farhan Mohamed","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Computer Science, Swansea University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267321300","id":37267321300,"full_name":"Philip W.

However, the benefits of using rhetorical illustrations or embellishments in visualization have so far been inconclusive. In this work, we report an empirical study to evaluate hypotheses that visual embellishments may aid memorization, visual search and concept comprehension. One major departure from related experiments in the literature is that we make use of a dual-task methodology in our experiment. This design offers an abstraction of typical situations where viewers do not have their full attention focused on visualization (e.g., in meetings and lectures). The secondary task introduces “divided attention”, and makes the effects of visual embellishments more observable. In addition, it also serves as additional masking in memory-based trials. The results of this study show that visual embellishments can help participants better remember the information depicted in visualization. On the other hand, visual embellishments can have a negative impact on the speed of visual search. The results show a complex pattern as to the benefits of visual embellishments in helping participants grasp key concepts from visualization.","article_number":"6327282","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327282","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327282/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327282/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2759","end_page":"2768","citing_paper_count":47,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Data visualization","Complexity theory","Speech","Grasping","Memory management","Humans"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual embellishments","metaphors","icons","cognition","working memory","long-term memory","visual search","evaluation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.284","title":"Visualization of Temporal Similarity in Field Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":81,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37553894500","id":37553894500,"full_name":"Steffen Frey","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282541900","id":37282541900,"full_name":"Filip Sadlo","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268023800","id":37268023800,"full_name":"Thomas Ertl","author_order":3}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"This paper presents a visualization approach for detecting and exploring similarity in the temporal variation of field data.

In this work we focus on the visualization of induced electric dipole moments on oxygen atoms in crack propagation simulations. The straightforward visualization using glyphs for the individual atoms, simple shapes like spheres or arrows, is insufficient for providing information about the data set as a whole. As our contribution we show for the first time that fractional anisotropy values computed from the local neighborhood of individual atoms of MD simulation data depict important information about relevant properties of the field of induced electric dipole moments. Iso surfaces in the field of fractional anisotropy as well as adjustments of the glyph representation allow the user to identify regions of correlated orientation.

Gravity amplified small density fluctuations generated shortly after the Big Bang, leading to the formation of galaxies in the cosmic web. These calculations have led to a growing demand for methods to analyze time-dependent particle based simulations. Rendering methods for such N-body simulation data usually employ some kind of splatting approach via point based rendering primitives and approximate the spatial distributions of physical quantities using kernel interpolation techniques, common in SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics)-codes. This paper proposes three GPU-assisted rendering approaches, based on a new, more accurate method to compute the physical densities of dark matter simulation data. It uses full phase-space information to generate a tetrahedral tessellation of the computational domain, with mesh vertices defined by the simulation's dark matter particle positions. Over time the mesh is deformed by gravitational forces, causing the tetrahedral cells to warp and overlap. The new methods are well suited to visualize the cosmic web. In particular they preserve caustics, regions of high density that emerge, when several streams of dark matter particles share the same location in space, indicating the formation of structures like sheets, filaments and halos. We demonstrate the superior image quality of the new approaches in a comparison with three standard rendering techniques for N-body simulation data.","article_number":"6327212","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327212","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327212/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327212/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2078","end_page":"2087","citing_paper_count":17,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Computational modeling","Rendering (computer graphics)","Graphics processing unit","Equations","Data models","Mathematical model"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Astrophysics","dark matter","n-body simulations","tetrahedral grids"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.215","title":"Does an Eye Tracker Tell the Truth about Visualizations?: Findings while Investigating Visualizations for Decision Making","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":87,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489894700","id":38489894700,"full_name":"Sung-Hee Kim","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489279100","id":38489279100,"full_name":"Zhihua Dong","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399307600","id":37399307600,"full_name":"Hanjun Xian","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489813800","id":38489813800,"full_name":"Benjavan Upatising","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"Purdue University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38238292000","id":38238292000,"full_name":"Ji Soo Yi","author_order":5}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"For information visualization researchers, eye tracking has been a useful tool to investigate research participants' underlying cognitive processes by tracking their eye movements while they interact with visual techniques.

These directed networks have strong structural characteristics: out-degrees with a scale-free distribution, in-degrees bound by a low maximum, and few and small cycles. Standard visualization techniques, such as node-link diagrams and adjacency matrices, are impeded by these network characteristics. The scale-free distribution of out-degrees causes a high number of intersecting edges in node-link diagrams. Adjacency matrices become space-inefficient due to the low in-degrees and the resulting sparse network. Compressed adjacency matrices, however, exploit these structural characteristics. By cutting open and rearranging an adjacency matrix, we achieve a compact and neatly-arranged visualization. Compressed adjacency matrices allow for easy detection of subnetworks with a specific structure, so-called motifs, which provide important knowledge about gene regulatory networks to domain experts. We summarize motifs commonly referred to in the literature, and relate them to network analysis tasks common to the visualization domain. We show that a user can easily find the important motifs in compressed adjacency matrices, and that this is hard in standard adjacency matrix and node-link diagrams. We also demonstrate that interaction techniques for standard adjacency matrices can be used for our compressed variant. These techniques include rearrangement clustering, highlighting, and filtering.","article_number":"6327251","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327251","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327251/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2457","end_page":"2466","citing_paper_count":33,"citing_patent_count":1,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Computer aided manufacturing","Standards","Sparse matrices","Layout","Bismuth","Proteins"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Network","gene regulation","scale-free","adjacency matrix"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.244","title":"Living Liquid: Design and Evaluation of an Exploratory Visualization Tool for Museum Visitors","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":89,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Exploratorium","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489269900","id":38489269900,"full_name":"Joyce Ma","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38241310900","id":38241310900,"full_name":"Isaac Liao","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275869400","id":37275869400,"full_name":"Kwan-Liu Ma","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Exploratorium","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233965200","id":38233965200,"full_name":"Jennifer Frazier","author_order":4}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Interactive visualizations can allow science museum visitors to explore new worlds by seeing and interacting with scientific data. However, designing interactive visualizations for informal learning environments, such as museums, presents several challenges. First, visualizations must engage visitors on a personal level. Second, visitors often lack the background to interpret visualizations of scientific data. Third, visitors have very limited time at individual exhibits in museums. This paper examines these design considerations through the iterative development and evaluation of an interactive exhibit as a visualization tool that gives museumgoers access to scientific data generated and used by researchers. The exhibit prototype, Living Liquid, encourages visitors to ask and answer their own questions while exploring the time-varying global distribution of simulated marine microbes using a touchscreen interface. Iterative development proceeded through three rounds of formative evaluations using think-aloud protocols and interviews, each round informing a key visualization design decision: (1) what to visualize to initiate inquiry, (2) how to link data at the microscopic scale to global patterns, and (3) how to include additional data that allows visitors to pursue their own questions. Data from visitor evaluations suggests that, when designing visualizations for public audiences, one should (1) avoid distracting visitors from data that they should explore, (2) incorporate background information into the visualization, (3) favor understandability over scientific accuracy, and (4) layer data accessibility to structure inquiry. Lessons learned from this case study add to our growing understanding of how to use visualizations to actively engage learners with scientific data.","article_number":"6327286","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327286","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327286/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327286/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2799","end_page":"2808","citing_paper_count":25,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Learning systems","Performance evaluation","Motion pictures","Prototypes","Information analysis","Image color analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Information visualization","user interaction","evaluation","user studies","science museums","informal learning environments"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.277","title":"Visual Classifier Training for Text Document Retrieval","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":90,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Universoty of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490630000","id":38490630000,"full_name":"Florian Heimerl","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Universoty of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593029700","id":37593029700,"full_name":"Steffen Koch","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Universoty of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37683989300","id":37683989300,"full_name":"Harald Bosch","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Universoty of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268023800","id":37268023800,"full_name":"Thomas Ertl","author_order":4}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Performing exhaustive searches over a large number of text documents can be tedious, since it is very hard to formulate search queries or define filter criteria that capture an analyst's information need adequately. Classification through machine learning has the potential to improve search and filter tasks encompassing either complex or very specific information needs, individually. Unfortunately, analysts who are knowledgeable in their field are typically not machine learning specialists. Most classification methods, however, require a certain expertise regarding their parametrization to achieve good results. Supervised machine learning algorithms, in contrast, rely on labeled data, which can be provided by analysts. However, the effort for labeling can be very high, which shifts the problem from composing complex queries or defining accurate filters to another laborious task, in addition to the need for judging the trained classifier's quality. We therefore compare three approaches for interactive classifier training in a user study. All of the approaches are potential candidates for the integration into a larger retrieval system. They incorporate active learning to various degrees in order to reduce the labeling effort as well as to increase effectiveness. Two of them encompass interactive visualization for letting users explore the status of the classifier in context of the labeled documents, as well as for judging the quality of the classifier in iterative feedback loops. We see our work as a step towards introducing user controlled classification methods in addition to text search and filtering for increasing recall in analytics scenarios involving large corpora.","article_number":"6327290","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327290","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327290/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327290/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2839","end_page":"2848","citing_paper_count":69,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Human computer interaction","Information retrieval","Performance evaluation","Visual analytics","Training data","Learning systems","Classification"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","human computer interaction","information retrieval","active learning","classification","user evaluation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.222","title":"Evaluation of Fast-Forward Video Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":91,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Visualization Research Center (VISUS), University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37680797500","id":37680797500,"full_name":"Markus Höferlin","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Visualization Research Center (VISUS), University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489885500","id":38489885500,"full_name":"Kuno Kurzhals","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Computer Vision Group, Institute of Cognitive Science, University of Osnabrück","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37571601300","id":37571601300,"full_name":"Benjamin Höferlin","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Computer Vision Group, Institute of Cognitive Science, University of Osnabrück","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266102100","id":37266102100,"full_name":"Gunther Heidemann","author_order":4},{"affiliation":"Visualization Research Center (VISUS), University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268045000","id":37268045000,"full_name":"Daniel Weiskopf","author_order":5}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We evaluate and compare video visualization techniques based on fast-forward.

The two state-of-the-art methods we consider are frame-skipping and temporal blending of successive frames. Our object trail visualization leverages a combination of frame-skipping and temporal blending, whereas predictive trajectory visualization supports motion perception by augmenting the video frames with an arrow that indicates the future object trajectory. Our hypothesis was that each of the state-of-the-art methods satisfies just one of the goals: support of object identification or motion perception. Thus, they represent both ends of the visualization design. The key findings of the evaluation are that object trail visualization supports object identification, whereas predictive trajectory visualization is most useful for motion perception. However, frame-skipping surprisingly exhibits reasonable performance for both tasks. Furthermore, we evaluate the subjective performance of three different playback speed visualizations for adaptive fast-forward, a subdomain of video fast-forward.","article_number":"6327214","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327214","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327214/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2095","end_page":"2103","citing_paper_count":12,"citing_patent_count":2,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Image color analysis","Trajectory","Data visualization","Rendering (computer graphics)","Acceleration","Video recording"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Video visualization","adaptive fast-forward","controlled laboratory user study"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.230","title":"Graphical Tests for Power Comparison of Competing Designs","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":92,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Iowa State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592793000","id":37592793000,"full_name":"Heike Hofmann","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"Iowa State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489858600","id":38489858600,"full_name":"Lendie Follett","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Iowa State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489014500","id":38489014500,"full_name":"Mahbubul Majumder","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Iowa State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37358631700","id":37358631700,"full_name":"Dianne Cook","author_order":4}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Lineups [4, 28] have been established as tools for visual testing similar to standard statistical inference tests, allowing us to evaluate the validity of graphical findings in an objective manner.

This makes lineups versatile, yet powerful, tools in situations where conditions for regular statistical tests are not or cannot be met. In this paper we introduce lineups as a tool for evaluating the power of competing graphical designs. We highlight some of the theoretical properties and then show results from two studies evaluating competing designs: both studies are designed to go to the limits of our perceptual abilities to highlight differences between designs. We use both accuracy and speed of evaluation as measures of a successful design. The first study compares the choice of coordinate system: polar versus cartesian coordinates. The results show strong support in favor of cartesian coordinates in finding fast and accurate answers to spotting patterns. The second study is aimed at finding shift differences between distributions. Both studies are motivated by data problems that we have recently encountered, and explore using simulated data to evaluate the plot designs under controlled conditions. Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is used to conduct the studies. The lineups provide an effective mechanism for objectively evaluating plot designs.","article_number":"6327249","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327249","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327249/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327249/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"2441","end_page":"2448","citing_paper_count":20,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Observers","Accuracy","Data models","Visual analytics","Statistical analysis","Inference mechanisms"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Lineups","Visual inference","Power comparison","Efficiency of displays"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.245","title":"Memorability of Visual Features in Network Diagrams","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":93,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Monash University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37354163600","id":37354163600,"full_name":"Kim Marriott","author_order":1},{"affiliation":"University of Glasgow","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37329672500","id":37329672500,"full_name":"Helen Purchase","author_order":2},{"affiliation":"Monash University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37867777700","id":37867777700,"full_name":"Michael Wybrow","author_order":3},{"affiliation":"Monash University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490359600","id":38490359600,"full_name":"Cagatay Goncu","author_order":4}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We investigate the cognitive impact of various layout features-symmetry, alignment, collinearity, axis alignment and orthogonality - on the recall of network diagrams (graphs).

Two natural questions arise from this premise: Which multivariate visualization techniques are the most effective for high-dimensional data sets?

We provide some insights to the second question based on the results of our study and results available in the literature.

To incorporate this information into the flow surface visualization and analysis process, we derive a metric tensor field that encodes local surface deformations as induced by the velocity gradient of the underlying flow field.

Graphics (TVCG). It contains 96 papers, including all papers presented at the IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference (Vis) and the IEEE Information Visualization Conference (InfoVis), and the 10 best papers presented at the IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technolgy (VAST), in Seattle, Washington, USA, from 14-19 October 2012. These papers that were recommended for acceptance by the program committee of these three conferences, after having undergone a rigorous two-round review process, are published in this issue. This special issue is the culmination of the ongoing partnership between TVCG and IEEE VisWeek. The goal of this cooperation between the IEEE Computer Society and the IEEE Visualization and Graphics Technical Committee (VGTC) is to introduce many high-quality research results from the world's top visualization conferences to TVCG’s readership, while improving the overall quality and visibility of conference publications through a rigorous journal-style review. This special issue continues to demonstrate that this objective has been achieved. With a similar motivation, the authors of 23 TVCG regular papers were invited to give an oral presentation of their recent work at IEEE VisWeek 2012. This arrangement provides a unique opportunity for the VisWeek audience to keep abreast of high-quality visualization research featured in TVCG, while encouraging more TVCG authors to attend VisWeek. Ultimately, this closely coupled relationship between TVCG and VisWeek should lead to a more timely exchange of new ideas, foster rapid dissemination of recent works via an integrated forum for both publications and presentations, and further expand and grow our community.","article_number":"6327199","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327199","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327199/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6327196,"publication_year":2012,"publication_date":"Dec. 2012","start_page":"ix","end_page":"ix","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"index_terms":{}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.290","title":"VisWeek 2012 Keynote Speaker","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":104,"volume":"18","authors":{"authors":[{"authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37563799500","id":37563799500,"full_name":"Mary Czerwinski","author_order":1}]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"A professional biography of Mary Czerwinski of Microsoft Research is presented.
