"We describe our approach to the analysis of 2017 VAST Challenge Mini-Challenge 2 data. The challenge deals with readings from air sampler stations. To answer the main question, the provenance of the chemicals measured at the sampler stations, we extend the provided data set by aggregated spatio-temporal provenance data. This data is generated from the provided meteorological data and locations map by using it as input for a particle tracer which calculates the provenance of the particles arriving from the emitters (factories) at the collectors (the locations of sampler stations).

"Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Combustion and turbulence simulations involve highly intermittent localized phenomena that generate high volumes of spatially and temporally varying field and particle data. The current paradigm of posthoc analysis and visualization will become increasingly infeasible as data volumes continue to increase. In the exascale era this problem will be further exacerbated by the difficulty of moving large volumes of data through deep complex memory hierarchies and across the machine network to hard disks on a heterogeneous supercomputer. I will discuss recent advances in in situ massively parallel volume and particle visualization algorithms coupled with analytics - e.g., topological feature segmentation/tracking, distance field construction, multi-variate statistics and eigensolutions of the reaction rate Jacobian - as an integral part of a scientific discovery from high-fidelity combustion simulations. The role of asynchronous task based programming models and runtimes to facilitate an extensible, performance portable computational science workflow at extreme scale will also be discussed in the context of recent turbulent ignition simulations.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585481/","LOCKED","8585481","Sandia National Laboratories","Sandia National Laboratories","","1","Jacqueline H.

"The datasets released for the VAST Challenge 2017 comprise vehicle movement data captured with RFID sensors, chemical emission data from factories captured by gas sensors, and image attributes of the wildlife plant health obtained from satellites, all pertaining to a fictional wildlife preserve. Using visual analytics, a compelling hypothesis is established to link the spatiotemporal datasets to the phenomenon, where the count of a bird specimen is found to decline over a given year. Anomalies in vehicle traffic patterns are linked to proximal factory emissions, and further associated with satellite imagery that show proof of degradation in plant quality in the preserve. The evidences are supported with visualizations created in Tableau, R, QGIS & SAS-JMP. Raster image analysis is also done to identify other key features in the preserve, such as the existence of a lake.

"A wealth of information is captured by traffic sensors but extracting and representing the said information is a challenge. We developed a data processing tool in Apache Spark to aggregate the data points recorded by the sensors and enrich it with geographical information as well. We also developed a tool in Processing to aid the visual analysis of this data set. It plots the paths identified in the transformed data as a subway map, while still preserving the relative locations of each sensor. The transformed data is also suitable for further analysis using existing tools such as Tableau.

"The VAST Challenge 2017 presents the case of the ornithologist Mitch, who wants to understand the vanishing of the Rose-crested Blue Pipit in the Boonsong Lekagul Nature preserve. To help the ornithologist to answer the challenge questions, we propose the Satellite Image Zooming and Exploration (SIZE) application that implements a framework to interactively zoom and explore satellite images of the preserve area provided by the VAST Mini Challenge 3. SIZE enables the experts to generate hypothesis through zooming and exploration, which he can further verify using different satellite images and Tableau. Two major hypothesis to help Mitch solving the poor development of the bird species are developed. One being the destruction of the habitat of the birds and the other being a heavy pollution of a lake in the preserve area.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585639/","LOCKED","8585639","University of Konstanz","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086560746","1","Udo Schlegel","37086560746","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Konstanz","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085736053","2","Alexandra Diehl","37085736053","University of Konstanz","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","3","Daniel A.

"Multi spectral imaging from a satellite enables to analyze the health of an natural environment over time. However, low resolution of the satellite images, and a lack of information of human activity and geological information makes it difficult to find and understand all temporal changes. We present an approach to analyze the change over time using satellite images of a natural preserve. We create a map, which contains all changes between two time steps, by using frame differencing. We then exclude uninteresting natural phenomena like clouds. The resulting map is than used to find all changes. Each of the changes is then analyzed in detail by using state of the art algorithm like false-colored images and ratio transformations.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585476/","LOCKED","8585476","VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073197900","1","Michael Beham","37073197900","","","","","","","","","","","","","VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085338700","2","Rainer Splechtna","37085338700","VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086554776","3","Silvana Podaras","37086554776","Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA","Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37323697500","4","Denis Gračanin","37323697500","VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37947312900","5","Krešimir Matković","37947312900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","3-6 Oct. 2017","Phoenix, AZ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2017.8585476","29","232","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585476/","I.3.8 [Computing Methodologies]: Computer Graphics—Applications","I.4.8 [Image Processing and Computer Vision]: Scene Analysis—Time-varying imagery","","","","","","","","Satellites","Cloud computing","Shape","Image color analysis","Vegetation mapping","Indexes","Image resolution","20181223","8585424","978-1-5386-3164-5","Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-3164-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-3163-8","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8585476","3-6 Oct. 2017","8574342","2017 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2017","IEEE","31","231","MC3 — Modified Frame Differencing of Satellite Images to Detect Temporal Changes in a Natural Preserve"
"Satellite images are helpful in remote sensing of land features. However, such multi-spectral images cannot be displayed using readily available imaging tools. We developed a tool in Processing that is able to read in multi-spectral images and display each band as a grayscale image. This tool also allows for mapping of any of the bands to red, green or blue channel of the displayed image. In this paper, we describe how such tool can be used in identifying land features as well as assist in finding changes over time.

"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been successfully applied to various natural language processing (NLP) tasks and achieved better results than conventional methods. However, the lack of understanding of the mechanisms behind their effectiveness limits further improvements on their architectures. In this paper, we present a visual analytics method for understanding and comparing RNN models for NLP tasks. We propose a technique to explain the function of individual hidden state units based on their expected response to input texts. We then co-cluster hidden state units and words based on the expected response and visualize co-clustering results as memory chips and word clouds to provide more structured knowledge on RNNs’ hidden states. We also propose a glyph-based sequence visualization based on aggregate information to analyze the behavior of an RNN’s hidden state at the sentence-level. The usability and effectiveness of our method are demonstrated through case studies and reviews from domain experts.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585721/","LOCKED","8585721","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086012043","1","Yao Ming","37086012043","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086561228","2","Shaozu Cao","37086561228","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086563144","3","Ruixiang Zhang","37086563144","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086546441","4","Zhen Li","37086546441","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085871141","5","Yuanzhe Chen","37085871141","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407140300","6","Yangqiu Song","37407140300","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","7","Huamin Qu","37272637300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","87","0","3-6 Oct. 2017","Phoenix, AZ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2017.8585721","1340","24","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585721/","recurrent neural networks","visual analytics","understanding neural model","co-clustering","","","","","","Recurrent neural networks","Analytical models","Computer architecture","Visual analytics","Task analysis","Machine learning","","20181223","8585424","978-1-5386-3164-5","Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-3164-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-3163-8","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8585721","3-6 Oct. 2017","8574342","2017 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2017","IEEE","38","13","Understanding Hidden Memories of Recurrent Neural Networks"
"Visual analytic tools combine the complementary strengths of humans and machines in human-in-the-loop systems. Humans provide invaluable domain expertise and sensemaking capabilities to this discourse with analytic models; however, little consideration has yet been given to the ways inherent human biases might shape the visual analytic process. In this paper, we establish a conceptual framework for considering bias assessment through human-in-the-loop systems and lay the theoretical foundations for bias measurement. We propose six preliminary metrics to systematically detect and quantify bias from user interactions and demonstrate how the metrics might be implemented in an existing visual analytic system, InterAxis. We discuss how our proposed metrics could be used by visual analytic systems to mitigate the negative effects of cognitive biases by making users aware of biased processes throughout their analyses.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585669/","LOCKED","8585669","Georgia Tech","Georgia Tech","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085898933","1","Emily Wall","37085898933","","","","","","","","","","","","","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086082442","2","Leslie M.

"Anchoring effect is the tendency to focus too heavily on one piece of information when making decisions. In this paper, we present a novel, systematic study and resulting analyses that investigate the effects of anchoring effect on human decision-making using visual analytic systems. Visual analytics interfaces typically contain multiple views that present various aspects of information such as spatial, temporal, and categorical. These views are designed to present complex, heterogeneous data in accessible forms that aid decision-making. However, human decision-making is often hindered by the use of heuristics, or cognitive biases, such as anchoring effect. Anchoring effect can be triggered by the order in which information is presented or the magnitude of information presented. Through carefully designed laboratory experiments, we present evidence of anchoring effect in analysis with visual analytics interfaces when users are primed by representation of different pieces of information. We also describe detailed analyses of users’ interaction logs which reveal the impact of anchoring bias on the visual representation preferred and paths of analysis. We discuss implications for future research to possibly detect and alleviate anchoring bias.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585665/","LOCKED","8585665","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38236879300","1","Isaac Cho","38236879300","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086557669","2","Ryan Wesslen","37086557669","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085510179","3","Alireza Karduni","37085510179","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086555427","4","Sashank Santhanam","37086555427","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089405406","5","Samira Shaikh","37089405406","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606064200","6","Wenwen Dou","37606064200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","38","0","3-6 Oct. 2017","Phoenix, AZ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2017.8585665","2277","126","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585665/","Visual Analytics","Anchoring Effect","Sense Making","Cognitive Bias","Interaction Log Analysis","K.6.1 [Management of Computing and Information Systems]: Project and People Management-Life Cycle","K.7.m [The Computing Profession]: Miscellaneous-Ethics","","","Decision making","Visual analytics","Analytical models","Task analysis","Data visualization","Uncertainty","","20181223","8585424","978-1-5386-3164-5","Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-3164-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-3163-8","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8585665","3-6 Oct. 2017","8574342","2017 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2017","IEEE","40","116","The Anchoring Effect in Decision-Making with Visual Analytics"
"Human-in-the-loop data analysis applications necessitate greater transparency in machine learning models for experts to understand and trust their decisions. To this end, we propose a visual analytics workflow to help data scientists and domain experts explore, diagnose, and understand the decisions made by a binary classifier. The approach leverages “instance-level explanations”, measures of local feature relevance that explain single instances, and uses them to build a set of visual representations that guide the users in their investigation. The workflow is based on three main visual representations and steps: one based on aggregate statistics to see how data distributes across correct / incorrect decisions; one based on explanations to understand which features are used to make these decisions; and one based on raw data, to derive insights on potential root causes for the observed patterns. The workflow is derived from a long-term collaboration with a group of machine learning and healthcare professionals who used our method to make sense of machine learning models they developed. The case study from this collaboration demonstrates that the proposed workflow helps experts derive useful knowledge about the model and the phenomena it describes, thus experts can generate useful hypotheses on how a model can be improved.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585720/","LOCKED","8585720","NYU Tandon School of Engineering","NYU Tandon School of Engineering","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085594931","1","Josua Krause","37085594931","","","","","","","","","","","","","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593202500","2","Aritra Dasgupta","37593202500","NYU School of Medicine","NYU School of Medicine","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086557596","3","Jordan Swartz","37086557596","NYU School of Medicine","NYU School of Medicine","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085687867","4","Yindalon Aphinyanaphongs","37085687867","NYU Tandon School of Engineering","NYU Tandon School of Engineering","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38267713800","5","Enrico Bertini","38267713800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","36","0","3-6 Oct. 2017","Phoenix, AZ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2017.8585720","629","172","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585720/","Machine Learning","Interpretation","Visual Analytics","","","","","","","Data models","Analytical models","Predictive models","Machine learning","Collaboration","Visual analytics","","20181223","8585424","978-1-5386-3164-5","Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-3164-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-3163-8","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8585720","3-6 Oct. 2017","8574342","2017 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2017","IEEE","41","162","A Workflow for Visual Diagnostics of Binary Classifiers using Instance-Level Explanations"
"Visual Analytics (VA) aims to combine the strengths of humans and computers for effective data analysis. In this endeavor, humans' tacit knowledge from prior experience is an important asset that can be leveraged by both human and computer to improve the analytic process. While VA environments are starting to include features to formalize, store, and utilize such knowledge, the mechanisms and degree in which these environments integrate explicit knowledge varies widely. Additionally, this important class of VA environments has never been elaborated on by existing work on VA theory. This paper proposes a conceptual model of Knowledge-assisted VA conceptually grounded on the visualization model by van Wijk. We apply the model to describe various examples of knowledge-assisted VA from the literature and elaborate on three of them in finer detail. Moreover, we illustrate the utilization of the model to compare different design alternatives and to evaluate existing approaches with respect to their use of knowledge. Finally, the model can inspire designers to generate novel VA environments using explicit knowledge effectively.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585498/","LOCKED","8585498","TU Wien, Austria","TU Wien, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37569322900","1","Paolo Federico","37569322900","","","","","","","","","","","","","St. Poelten University of Applied Sciences, Austria and TU Wien, Austria","St. Poelten University of Applied Sciences, Austria and TU Wien, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085865698","2","Markus Wagner","37085865698","St. Poelten University of Applied Sciences, Austria and TU Wien, Austria","St. Poelten University of Applied Sciences, Austria and TU Wien, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077207200","3","Alexander Rind","37077207200","TU Wien, Austria","TU Wien, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085361518","4","Albert Amor-Amorós","37085361518","TU Wien, Austria","TU Wien, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282584500","5","Silvia Miksch","37282584500","TU Wien, Austria","TU Wien, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267339500","6","Wolfgang Aigner","37267339500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","27","0","3-6 Oct. 2017","Phoenix, AZ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2017.8585498","739","103","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585498/","Automated analysis","tacit knowledge","explicit knowledge","visual analytics","information visualization","theory and model","","","","Data visualization","Data analysis","Cognition","Knowledge based systems","Data models","Visual analytics","Analytical models","20181223","8585424","978-1-5386-3164-5","Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-3164-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-3163-8","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8585498","3-6 Oct. 2017","8574342","2017 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2017","IEEE","42","92","The Role of Explicit Knowledge: A Conceptual Model of Knowledge-Assisted Visual Analytics"
"Deriving the exact casual model that governs the relations between variables in a multidimensional dataset is difficult in practice. It is because causal inference algorithms by themselves typically cannot encode an adequate amount of domain knowledge to break all ties. Visual analytic approaches are considered a feasible alternative to fully automated methods. However, their application in real-world scenarios can be tedious. This paper focuses on these practical aspects of visual causality analysis. The most imperative of these aspects is posed by Simpson' Paradox. It implies the existence of multiple causal models differing in both structure and parameter depending on how the data is subdivided. We propose a comprehensive interface that engages human experts in identifying these subdivisions and allowing them to establish the corresponding causal models via a rich set of interactive facilities. Other features of our interface include: (1) a new causal network visualization that emphasizes the flow of causal dependencies, (2) a model scoring mechanism with visual hints for interactive model refinement, and (3) flexible approaches for handling heterogeneous data. Various real-world data examples are given.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585647/","LOCKED","8585647","Visual Analytics and Imaging Lab, Stony Brook University","Visual Analytics and Imaging Lab, Stony Brook University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085621793","1","Jun Wang","37085621793","","","","","","","","","","","","","Visual Analytics and Imaging Lab, Stony Brook University","Visual Analytics and Imaging Lab, Stony Brook University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273119700","2","Klaus Mueller","37273119700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","23","0","3-6 Oct. 2017","Phoenix, AZ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2017.8585647","602","161","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585647/","Visual knowledge discovery","Causality","Hypothesis testing","Visual evidence","High-dimensional data","","","","","Analytical models","Data models","Data visualization","Visual analytics","Inference algorithms","Correlation","","20181223","8585424","978-1-5386-3164-5","Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-3164-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-3163-8","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8585647","3-6 Oct. 2017","8574342","2017 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2017","IEEE","43","151","Visual Causality Analysis Made Practical"
"Significant events are often discussed and spread through social media, involving many people. Reposting activities and opinions expressed in social media offer good opportunities to understand the evolution of events. However, the dynamics of reposting activities and the diversity of user comments pose challenges to understand event-related social media data. We propose E-Map, a visual analytics approach that uses map-like visualization tools to help multi-faceted analysis of social media data on a significant event and in-depth understanding of the development of the event. E-Map transforms extracted keywords, messages, and reposting behaviors into map features such as cities, towns, and rivers to build a structured and semantic space for users to explore. It also visualizes complex posting and reposting behaviors as simple trajectories and connections that can be easily followed. By supporting multi-level spatial temporal exploration, E-Map helps to reveal the patterns of event development and key players in an event, disclosing the ways they shape and affect the development of the event. Two cases analysing real-world events confirm the capacities of E-Map in facilitating the analysis of event evolution with social media data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585638/","LOCKED","8585638","Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education) and School of EECS, Peking University, China","Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education) and School of EECS, Peking University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085387892","1","Siming Chen","37085387892","","","","","","","","","","","","","Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education) and School of EECS, Peking University, China","Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education) and School of EECS, Peking University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086146756","2","Shuai Chen","37086146756","Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education) and School of EECS, Peking University, China","Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education) and School of EECS, Peking University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086558503","3","Lijing Lin","37086558503","Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education) and School of EECS, Peking University, China","Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education) and School of EECS, Peking University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403856700","4","Xiaoru Yuan","37403856700","Faculty of Engineer and Information Technology, The University of Technology, Sydney, Australia","Faculty of Engineer and Information Technology, The University of Technology, Sydney, Australia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085343774","5","Jie Liang","37085343774","College of Information Sciences and Technology, Pennsylvania State University, USA","College of Information Sciences and Technology, Pennsylvania State University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086547462","6","Xiaolong Zhang","37086547462","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","17","0","3-6 Oct. 2017","Phoenix, AZ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2017.8585638","871","47","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585638/","Social Media","Event Analysis","Map-like Visual Metaphor","Spatial Temporal Visual Analytics","","","","","","Visual analytics","Twitter","Rivers","Data visualization","Urban areas","","","20181223","8585424","978-1-5386-3164-5","Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-3164-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-3163-8","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8585638","3-6 Oct. 2017","8574342","2017 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2017","IEEE","44","36","E-Map: A Visual Analytics Approach for Exploring Significant Event Evolutions in Social Media"
"Social media data bear valuable insights regarding events that occur around the world. Events are inherently temporal and spatial. Existing visual text analysis systems have focused on detecting and analyzing past and ongoing events. Few have leveraged social media information to look for events that may occur in the future. In this paper, we present an interactive visual analytic system, CrystalBall, that automatically identifies and ranks future events from Twitter streams. CrystalBall integrates new methods to discover events with interactive visualizations that permit sensemaking of the identified future events. Our computational methods integrate seven different measures to identify and characterize future events, leveraging information regarding time, location, social networks, and the informativeness of the messages. A visual interface is tightly coupled with the computational methods to present a concise summary of the possible future events. A novel connection graph and glyphs are designed to visualize the characteristics of the future events. To demonstrate the efficacy of CrystalBall in identifying future events and supporting interactive analysis, we present multiple case studies and validation studies on analyzing events derived from Twitter data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585658/","LOCKED","8585658","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38236879300","1","Isaac Cho","38236879300","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086557669","2","Ryan Wesslen","37086557669","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586579000","3","Svitlana Volkova","37586579000","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300425000","4","William Ribarsky","37300425000","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606064200","5","Wenwen Dou","37606064200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","11","0","3-6 Oct. 2017","Phoenix, AZ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2017.8585658","538","35","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585658/","Social media analysis","Event detection and analysis","visual analytics","","","","","","","Twitter","Visual analytics","Event detection","Law enforcement","Time measurement","","","20181223","8585424","978-1-5386-3164-5","Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-3164-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-3163-8","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8585658","3-6 Oct. 2017","8574342","2017 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2017","IEEE","45","25","CrystalBall: A Visual Analytic System for Future Event Discovery and Analysis from Social Media Data"
"We present a visualization system for users to examine real-time strategy games, which have become very popular globally in recent years. Unlike previous systems that focus on showing statistics and build order, our system can depict the most important part - battles in the games. Specifically, we visualize detailed movements of armies belonging to respective nations on a map and enable users to examine battles from a global view to a local view. In the global view, battles are depicted by curved arrows revealing how the armies enter and escape from the battlefield. By observing the arrows and the height map, users can make sense of offensive and defensive strategies easily. In the local view, units of each type are rendered on the map, and their movements are represented by animation. We also render an attack line between a pair of units if one of them can attack the other to help users analyze the advantages and disadvantages of a particular formation. Accordingly, users can utilize our system to discover statistics, build order, and battles, and learn strategies from games played by professionals.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585594/","LOCKED","8585594","National Chiao Tung University","National Chiao Tung University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085632802","1","Yen-Ting Kuan","37085632802","","","","","","","","","","","","","National Chiao Tung University","National Chiao Tung University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407536000","2","Yu-Shuen Wang","37407536000","National Chiao Tung University","National Chiao Tung University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085630889","3","Jung-Hong Chuang","37085630889","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10","0","3-6 Oct. 2017","Phoenix, AZ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2017.8585594","441","80","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585594/","real-time strategy games","StarCraft","game visualization","trajectories","","","","","","Games","Buildings","Visualization","Tools","Artificial intelligence","Real-time systems","Training","20181223","8585424","978-1-5386-3164-5","Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-3164-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-3163-8","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8585594","3-6 Oct. 2017","8574342","2017 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2017","IEEE","46","71","Visualizing Real-Time Strategy Games: The Example of StarCraft II"
"Textual criticism consists of the identification and analysis of variant readings among different versions of a text. Being a relatively simple task for modern languages, the collation of medieval text traditions ranges from the complex to the virtually impossible depending on the degree of instability of textual transmission. We present a visual analytics environment that supports computationally aligning such complex textual differences typical of orally inflected medieval poetry. For the purpose of analyzing alignment, we provide interactive visualizations for different text hierarchy levels, specifically, a meso reading view to support investigating repetition and variance at the line level across text segments. In addition to outlining important aspects of our interdisciplinary collaboration, we emphasize the utility of the proposed system by various usage scenarios in medieval French literature.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585505/","LOCKED","8585505","Image and Signal Processing Group, Institute for Computer Science, Leipzig University, Germany","Image and Signal Processing Group, Institute for Computer Science, Leipzig University, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38243241100","1","Stefan Jänicke","38243241100","","","","","","","","","","","","","Digital Humanities, New York University Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","Digital Humanities, New York University Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086557413","2","David Joseph Wrisley","37086557413","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8","0","3-6 Oct. 2017","Phoenix, AZ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2017.8585505","315","138","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585505/","","","","","","","","","","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Task analysis","Phonetics","Prototypes","Heating systems","","20181223","8585424","978-1-5386-3164-5","Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-3164-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-3163-8","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8585505","3-6 Oct. 2017","8574342","2017 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2017","IEEE","47","127","Interactive Visual Alignment of Medieval Text Versions"
"Current and future supercomputers have tens of thousands of compute nodes interconnected with high-dimensional networks and complex network topologies for improved performance. Application developers are required to write scalable parallel programs in order to achieve high throughput on these machines. Application performance is largely determined by efficient inter-process communication. A common way to analyze and optimize performance is through profiling parallel codes to identify communication bottlenecks. However, understanding gigabytes of profiled at a is not a trivial task. In this paper, we present a visual analytics system for identifying the scalability bottlenecks and improving the communication efficiency of massively parallel applications. Visualization methods used in this system are designed to comprehend large-scale and varied communication patterns on thousands of nodes in complex networks such as the 5D torus and the dragonfly. We also present efficient rerouting and remapping algorithms that can be coupled with our interactive visual analytics design for performance optimization. We demonstrate the utility of our system with several case studies using three benchmark applications on two leading supercomputers. The mapping suggestion from our system led to 38% improvement in hop-bytes for Mini AMR application on 4,096 MPI processes.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585646/","LOCKED","8585646","University of California, Davis","University of California, Davis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086133964","1","Takanori Fujiwara","37086133964","","","","","","","","","","","","","Argonne National Laboratory","Argonne National Laboratory","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591275300","2","Preeti Malakar","37591275300","Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis","Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38581219900","3","Khairi Reda","38581219900","Argonne National Laboratory","Argonne National Laboratory","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282610100","4","Venkatram Vishwanath","37282610100","Argonne National Laboratory, Northern Illinois University","Argonne National Laboratory, Northern Illinois University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267817200","5","Michael E.

"Subspace analysis methods have gained interest for identifying patterns in subspaces of high-dimensional data. Existing techniques allow to visualize and compare patterns in subspaces. However, many subspace analysis methods produce an abundant amount of patterns, which often remain redundant and are difficult to relate. Creating effective layouts for comparison of subspace patterns remains challenging. We introduce Pattern Trails, a novel approach for visually ordering and comparing subspace patterns. Central to our approach is the notion of pattern transitions as an interpretable structure imposed to order and compare patterns between subspaces. The basic idea is to visualize projections of subspaces side-by-side, and indicate changes between adjacent patterns in the subspaces by a linked representation, hence introducing pattern transitions. Our contributions comprise a systematization for how pairs of subspace patterns can be compared, and how changes can be interpreted in terms of pattern transitions. We also contribute a technique for visual subspace analysis based on a data-driven similarity measure between subspace representations. This measure is useful to order the patterns, and interactively group subspaces to reduce redundancy. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by application to several use cases, indicating that data can be meaningfully ordered and interpreted in terms of pattern transitions.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585613/","LOCKED","8585613","University of Konstanz","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233561600","1","Dominik Jäckle","38233561600","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Konstanz","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085899690","2","Michael Hund","37085899690","University of Konstanz","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38551542600","3","Michael Behrisch","38551542600","University of Konstanz","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","4","Daniel A.

"Storylines are adept at communicating complex change by encoding time on the x-axis and using the proximity of lines in the y direction to represent interaction between entities. The original definition of a storyline visualization requires data defined in terms of explicit interaction groups. Relaxing this definition allows storyline visualization to be applied more generally, but this creates questions about how the y-coordinate should encode interactions when this is tied to a particular place or state. To answer this question, we conducted a design study where we considered two layout algorithm design alternatives within a geo-temporal analysis tool written to solve part of the VAST Challenge 2014. We measured the performance of users at overview and detail oriented tasks between two storyline layout algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work to question the design principles for storyline visualization, and what we found surprised us. For overview tasks with the alternative layout, which has a consistent encoding for the y-coordinate, users performed moderately better (p <; .05) than the storyline layout based on existing design constraints and aesthetic criteria. Our empirical findings were also supported by first-hand accounts taken from interviews with multiple expert analysts, who suggested that the inconsistent meaning of the y-axis was misleading. These findings led us to design a new storyline layout algorithm that is a “best of both” where the y-axis has a consistent meaning but aesthetic criteria (e.g., line crossings) are considered.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585487/","LOCKED","8585487","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085670117","1","Dustin Arendt","37085670117","","","","","","","","","","","","","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086068397","2","Meg Pirrung","37086068397","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4","0","3-6 Oct. 2017","Phoenix, AZ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2017.8585487","451","91","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585487/","Storyline visualization","layout algorithms","interaction context","geospatial analysis","VAST Challenge","","","","","Layout","Visualization","Tools","Public transportation","Data visualization","Heuristic algorithms","Interviews","20181223","8585424","978-1-5386-3164-5","Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-3164-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-3163-8","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8585487","3-6 Oct. 2017","8574342","2017 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2017","IEEE","50","81","The “y” of it Matters, Even for Storyline Visualization"
"We present CRICTO, a new crowdsourcing visual analytics environment for making sense of and analyzing text data, whereby multiple crowdworkers are able to parallelize the simple information schematization tasks of relating and connecting entities across documents. The diverse links from these schematization tasks are then automatically combined and the system visualizes them based on the semantic types of the linkages. CRICTO also includes several tools that allow analysts to interactively explore and refine crowdworkers' results to better support their own sensemaking processes. We evaluated CRICTO's techniques and analysis workflow with deployments of CRICTO using Amazon Mechanical Turk and a user study that assess the effect of crowdsourced schematization in sensemaking tasks. The results of our evaluation show that CRICTO's crowdsourcing approaches and workflow help analysts explore diverse aspects of datasets, and uncover more accurate hidden stories embedded in the text datasets.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585484/","LOCKED","8585484","University of Alabama in Huntsville","University of Alabama in Huntsville","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37597408500","1","Haeyong Chung","37597408500","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Alabama in Huntsville","University of Alabama in Huntsville","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086561811","2","Sai Prashanth Dasari","37086561811","University of Alabama in Huntsville","University of Alabama in Huntsville","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086553914","3","Santhosh Nandhakumar","37086553914","Middlebury College","Middlebury College","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37587847300","4","Christopher Andrews","37587847300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4","0","3-6 Oct. 2017","Phoenix, AZ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2017.8585484","208","150","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585484/","Visual text analytics","sensemaking","crowdsourcing","","","","","","","Task analysis","Crowdsourcing","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Tools","Collaboration","","20181223","8585424","978-1-5386-3164-5","Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-3164-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-3163-8","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8585484","3-6 Oct. 2017","8574342","2017 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2017","IEEE","51","139","CRICTO: Supporting Sensemaking through Crowdsourced Information Schematization"
"The VAST Challenge 2017 offered three mini-challenges and a grand challenge dealing with environmental problems potentially caused by human patterns of life and potentially harmful chemically laden effluent plumes being emitted from factory smokestacks. The data provided included traffic patterns, sensor data though a Preserve, information about the Preserve, multispectral imagery and a map to help an ornithology graduate student particularly concerned with the population decrease of the Rose-Crested Blue Pipit determine who and what might be responsible. Mini-Challenge 1 focused on analysis of vehicles passing through the Preserve over time. Mini-Challenge 2 looked at data collected by air sampling monitors surrounding nearby factories, along with meteorological readings, to understand potential impacts they may be having on the Pipit. Mini-Challenge 3 required investigation into several months of multi-spectral imagery over the area to understand the Preserve's general health. The Grand Challenge asked participants to synthesize across all three mini-challenges to create hypotheses of what is happening and what sensible next steps could be. This year's challenge received 58 submissions and recorded over 1100 unique downloads from 20 countries prior to the submission deadline.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585503/","LOCKED","8585503","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37357067600","1","Mark A.

"Developing sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) systems requires AI researchers to experiment with different designs and analyze results from evaluations (we refer this task as evaluation analysis). In this paper, we tackle the challenges of evaluation analysis in the domain of question-answering (QA) systems. Through in-depth studies with QA researchers, we identify tasks and goals of evaluation analysis and derive a set of design rationales, based on which we propose a novel approach termed prismatic analysis. Prismatic analysis examines data through multiple ways of categorization (referred as angles). Categories in each angle are measured by aggregate metrics to enable diverse comparison scenarios. To facilitate prismatic analysis of QA evaluations, we design and implement the Question Space Anglyzer (QSAnglyzer), a visual analytics (VA) tool. In QSAnglyzer, the high-dimensional space formed by questions is divided into categories based on several angles (e.g., topic and question type). Each category is aggregated by accuracy, the number of questions, and accuracy variance across evaluations. QSAnglyzer visualizes these angles so that QA researchers can examine and compare evaluations from various aspects both individually and collectively. Furthermore, QA researchers filter questions based on any angle by clicking to construct complex queries. We validate QSAnglyzer through controlled experiments and by expert reviews. The results indicate that when using QSAnglyzer, users perform analysis tasks faster (p <; 0.01) and more accurately (p <; 0.05), and are quick to gain new insight. We discuss how prismatic analysis and QSAnglyzer scaffold evaluation analysis, and provide directions for future research.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585733/","LOCKED","8585733","University of Washington","University of Washington","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085341619","1","Nan-Chen Chen","37085341619","","","","","","","","","","","","","Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence","Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37060959200","2","Been Kim","37060959200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","3-6 Oct. 2017","Phoenix, AZ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2017.8585733","165","58","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585733/","visual analytics","visualization","interactive visualization","question answering","multi-experiment analysis","visual comparison","visual exploration","prismatic analysis","H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: User Interfaces—","Computational modeling","Task analysis","Measurement","Aggregates","Visual analytics","Knowledge discovery","","20181223","8585424","978-1-5386-3164-5","Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-3164-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-3163-8","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8585733","3-6 Oct. 2017","8574342","2017 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2017","IEEE","53","48","QSAnglyzer: Visual Analytics for Prismatic Analysis of Question Answering System Evaluations"
"It's time to change our minds about data. Data is often perceived as inevitably cold, but instead it can be more than numbers, it can represent real life and it can be a snapshot of the world in the same way that a picture catches small moments in time. The more ubiquitous data becomes, the more we need to experiment with how to make it unique, contextual, intimate; and the way we visualize it is crucial as it is the key to translating numbers into concepts we can relate to. In an aspirational talk, Giorgia will discuss how to see this moment as an opportunity to jumpstart a new renaissance, where we can question the impersonality of a merely technical approach to data, where we are ready to reconnect numbers to what they really stand for: which are more and more our lives.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585625/","EPHEMERA","8585625","Accurat","Accurat","","1","Giorgia Lupi","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4","0","3-6 Oct. 2017","Phoenix, AZ, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2017.8585625","982","1","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585625/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","20181223","8585424","978-1-5386-3164-5","Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-3164-5","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-5386-3163-8","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8585625","3-6 Oct. 2017","8574342","2017 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2017","IEEE","54","1","VIS Capstone Address Data Humanism: The Revolution will be Visualized"
