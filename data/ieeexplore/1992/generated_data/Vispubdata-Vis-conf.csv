A project undertaken to visualize the simulation results is reported. The project comprised analyzing model requirements and determining suitable visualization techniques, visualizing a preliminary, smaller-scale model to verify the techniques; and visualizing the full-scale model. Problems encountered and resolutions of problems at each stage are described. Validation, as well as insights revealed about the model through the preliminary and final visualization, are discussed.

In addition, the resolution of the approximation can be varied point by point using the local property of the wavelets.

The method is an effective way of guaranteeing that the triangle vertices are points of higher curvature, and that the triangle edges correspond to distinctive edges on the surfaces. Triangulations of surfaces with constant curvature-and hence no distinctive features-will gain nothing from this or any other optimization algorithm.

The tracking process is mass conservative and does not use a time stepping method for integration, thus eliminating a computationally intensive part of traditional tracking algorithms.

The emphasis is on exploiting the mathematical properties of tensor fields in order to facilitate their visualization and to produce a continuous representation of the data. The focus is on interactively sensing and exploring real and symmetric second-order tensor data by generalizing the vector notion of streamline to the tensor concept of hyperstreamline. The importance of a structural analysis of the data field analogous to the techniques of vector field topology extraction in order to obtain a unique and objective representation of second-order tensor fields is stressed.<>,,T.

By means of the 'pyramidal volume' traversing technique, one achieves high-quality, constant-time filtering, independent of the data resolution.
