"Graphs have been widely used to model relationships among data. For large graphs, excessive edge crossings make the display visually cluttered and thus difﬁcult to explore. In this paper, we propose a novel geometry-based edge-clustering framework that can group edges into bundles to reduce the overall edge crossings. Our method uses a control mesh to guide the edge-clustering process; edge bundles can be formed by forcing all edges to pass through some control points on the mesh. The control mesh can be generated at different levels of detail either manually or automatically based on underlying graph patterns. Users can further interact with the edge-clustering results through several advanced visualization techniques such as color and opacity enhancement. Compared with other edge-clustering methods, our approach is intuitive, ﬂexible, and efﬁcient. The experiments on some large graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658140/","LOCKED","4658140","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37391623900","1","Weiwei Cui","37391623900","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37405368200","2","Hong Zhou","37405368200","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","3","Huamin Qu","37272637300","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38193849400","4","Pak Chung Wong","38193849400","Peking University, China","Peking University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37293190400","5","Xiaoming Li","37293190400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","183","6","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.135","2470","1284","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658140/","Index Terms—","Graph visualization","","","visual clutter","mesh","edge clustering","","","","","","Cities and towns","Road transportation","","Automatic control","Data visualization","Displays","Automatic generation control","Mesh generation","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Switches","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658140","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","1","1277","Geometry-Based Edge Clustering for Graph Visualization","14"
"Scatterplots remain one of the most popular and widely-used visual representations for multidimensional data due to their simplicity, familiarity and visual clarity, even if they lack some of the flexibility and visual expressiveness of newer multidimensional visualization techniques. This paper presents new interactive methods to explore multidimensional data using scatterplots. This exploration is performed using a matrix of scatterplots that gives an overview of the possible configurations, thumbnails of the scatterplots, and support for interactive navigation in the multidimensional space. Transitions between scatterplots are performed as animated rotations in 3D space, somewhat akin to rolling dice. Users can iteratively build queries using bounding volumes in the dataset, sculpting the query from different viewpoints to become more and more refined. Furthermore, the dimensions in the navigation space can be reordered, manually or automatically, to highlight salient correlations and differences among them. An example scenario presents the interaction techniques supporting smooth and effortless visual exploration of multidimensional datasets.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658123/","LOCKED","4658123","INRIA, Paris, France","","INRIA, Paris, France","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295438200","1","Niklas Elmqvist","37295438200","INRIA, Paris, France","","INRIA, Paris, France","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590932700","2","Pierre Dragicevic","37590932700","INRIA, Paris, France","INRIA, Paris, France","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407972900","3","Jean-Daniel Fekete","37407972900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","251","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.153","3555","1148","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658123/","Index Terms—","visual exploration","","","visual queries","visual analytics","navigation","multivariate data","interaction","","","","Multidimensional systems","Navigation","","Light scattering","Data visualization","Animation","Graphics","Visual analytics","Optical polarization","Vocabulary","Rendering (computer graphics)","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658123","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","2","1539","Rolling the Dice: Multidimensional Visual Exploration using Scatterplot Matrix Navigation","14"
"Animation has been used to show trends in multi-dimensional data. This technique has recently gained new prominence for presentations, most notably with Gapminder Trendalyzer. In Trendalyzer, animation together with interesting data and an engaging presenter helps the audience understand the results of an analysis of the data. It is less clear whether trend animation is effective for analysis. This paper proposes two alternative trend visualizations that use static depictions of trends: one which shows traces of all trends overlaid simultaneously in one display and a second that uses a small multiples display to show the trend traces side-by-side. The paper evaluates the three visualizations for both analysis and presentation. Results indicate that trend animation can be challenging to use even for presentations; while it is the fastest technique for presentation and participants find it enjoyable and exciting, it does lead to many participant errors. Animation is the least effective form for analysis; both static depictions of trends are significantly faster than animation, and the small multiples display is more accurate.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658146/","LOCKED","4658146","Microsoft Research","","Microsoft Research","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37448060300","1","George Robertson","37448060300","Microsoft Research","","Microsoft Research","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37603822300","2","Roland Fernandez","37603822300","Microsoft Research","Microsoft Research","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37542391000","3","Danyel Fisher","37542391000","Microsoft Research","Microsoft Research","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37293389400","4","Bongshin Lee","37293389400","Georgia Institute of Technology","Georgia Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267736900","5","John Stasko","37267736900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","230","5","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.125","3713","1332","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658146/","Index Terms—","Information visualization","","","animation","trends","design","experiment","","","","","Animation","Data visualization","","Data analysis","Displays","Dictionaries","","","","","","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658146","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","3","1325","Effectiveness of Animation in Trend Visualization","14"
"In February 2008, the New York Times published an unusual chart of box office revenues for 7500 movies over 21 years. The chart was based on a similar visualization, developed by the first author, that displayed trends in music listening. This paper describes the design decisions and algorithms behind these graphics, and discusses the reaction on the Web. We suggest that this type of complex layered graph is effective for displaying large data sets to a mass audience. We provide a mathematical analysis of how this layered graph relates to traditional stacked graphs and to techniques such as ThemeRiver, showing how each method is optimizing a different ldquoenergy functionrdquo. Finally, we discuss techniques for coloring and ordering the layers of such graphs. Throughout the paper, we emphasize the interplay between considerations of aesthetics and legibility.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658136/","LOCKED","4658136","The New York Times","","The New York Times","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37868017200","1","Lee Byron","37868017200","Visual Communication Laboratory at IBM","","Visual Communication Laboratory at IBM","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550759700","2","Martin Wattenberg","37550759700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","229","14","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.166","2751","1252","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658136/","Index Terms—","Streamgraph","","","ThemeRiver","listening history","last.fm","aesthetics","communication-minded visualization","time series","","","Geometry","Data visualization","","Algorithm design and analysis","Graphics","History","Motion pictures","Process design","Blogs","Mathematical analysis","Optimization methods","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658136","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","4","1245","Stacked Graphs – Geometry & Aesthetics","14"

"Interactive history tools, ranging from basic undo and redo to branching timelines of user actions, facilitate iterative forms of interaction. In this paper, we investigate the design of history mechanisms for information visualization. We present a design space analysis of both architectural and interface issues, identifying design decisions and associated trade-offs. Based on this analysis, we contribute a design study of graphical history tools for Tableau, a database visualization system. These tools record and visualize interaction histories, support data analysis and communication of findings, and contribute novel mechanisms for presenting, managing, and exporting histories. Furthermore, we have analyzed aggregated collections of history sessions to evaluate Tableau usage. We describe additional tools for analyzing userspsila history logs and how they have been applied to study usage patterns in Tableau.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658129/","LOCKED","4658129","University of California Berkeley, USA","","University of California Berkeley, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550791300","1","Jeffrey Heer","37550791300","Tableau Software, Inc.","","Tableau Software, Inc.","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37372036700","2","Jock Mackinlay","37372036700","Tableau Software, Inc.","Tableau Software, Inc.","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37442008700","3","Chris Stolte","37442008700","University of California Berkeley, USA","University of California Berkeley, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282718200","4","Maneesh Agrawala","37282718200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","179","18","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.137","3169","1196","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658129/","Index Terms—","Visualization","","","history","undo","analysis","presentation","evaluation","","","","History","Data visualization","","Pattern analysis","Visual databases","Data analysis","Research and development","Aggregates","Usability","Presses","Mice","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658129","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","6","1189","Graphical Histories for Visualization: Supporting Analysis, Communication, and Evaluation","14"
"The Morse-Smale (MS) complex has proven to be a useful tool in extracting and visualizing features from scalar-valued data. However, efficient computation of the MS complex for large scale data remains a challenging problem. We describe a new algorithm and easily extensible framework for computing MS complexes for large scale data of any dimension where scalar values are given at the vertices of a closure-finite and weak topology (CW) complex, therefore enabling computation on a wide variety of meshes such as regular grids, simplicial meshes, and adaptive multiresolution (AMR) meshes. A new divide-and-conquer strategy allows for memory-efficient computation of the MS complex and simplification on-the-fly to control the size of the output. In addition to being able to handle various data formats, the framework supports implementation-specific optimizations, for example, for regular data. We present the complete characterization of critical point cancellations in all dimensions. This technique enables the topology based analysis of large data on off-the-shelf computers. In particular we demonstrate the first full computation of the MS complex for a 1 billion/10243 node grid on a laptop computer with 2 Gb memory.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658183/","LOCKED","4658183","UC Davis and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","","UC Davis and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37870001700","1","Attila Gyulassy","37870001700","Lawrence Livemore National Laboratory","","Lawrence Livemore National Laboratory","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564112000","2","Peer-Timo Bremer","37564112000","University of California, Davis, USA","University of California, Davis, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282068700","3","Bernd Hamann","37282068700","University of Utah, USA","University of Utah, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284312600","4","Valerio Pascucci","37284312600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","130","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.110","704","1626","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658183/","Index Terms—","Topology-based analysis","","","Morse-Smale complex","large scale data.","","","","","","","Scalability","Grid computing","","Large-scale systems","Topology","Data mining","Data visualization","Feature extraction","Adaptive mesh refinement","Size control","Data analysis","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658183","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","7","1619","A Practical Approach to Morse-Smale Complex Computation: Scalability and Generality","14"
"The visualization of complex 3D images remains a challenge, a fact that is magnified by the difficulty to classify or segment volume data. In this paper, we introduce size-based transfer functions, which map the local scale of features to color and opacity. Features in a data set with similar or identical scalar values can be classified based on their relative size. We achieve this with the use of scale fields, which are 3D fields that represent the relative size of the local feature at each voxel. We present a mechanism for obtaining these scale fields at interactive rates, through a continuous scale-space analysis and a set of detection filters. Through a number of examples, we show that size-based transfer functions can improve classification and enhance volume rendering techniques, such as maximum intensity projection. The ability to classify objects based on local size at interactive rates proves to be a powerful method for complex data exploration.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658153/","LOCKED","4658153","University of California, Davis, USA","","University of California, Davis, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282925900","1","Carlos Correa","37282925900","University of California, Davis, USA","","University of California, Davis, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275869400","2","Kwan-Liu Ma","37275869400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","120","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.162","957","1387","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658153/","Index Terms—","Transfer Functions","","","Interactive Visualization","Volume Rendering","Scale Space","GPU Techniques","","","","","Transfer functions","Data visualization","","Aneurysm","Image segmentation","Frequency","Angiography","Cancer detection","Veins","Arteries","Neoplasms","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658153","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","8","1380","Size-based Transfer Functions: A New Volume Exploration Technique","14"

"The ability to identify and present the most essential aspects of time-varying data is critically important in many areas of science and engineering. This paper introduces an importance-driven approach to time-varying volume data visualization for enhancing that ability. By conducting a block-wise analysis of the data in the joint feature-temporal space, we derive an importance curve for each data block based on the formulation of conditional entropy from information theory. Each curve characterizes the local temporal behavior of the respective block, and clustering the importance curves of all the volume blocks effectively classifies the underlying data. Based on different temporal trends exhibited by importance curves and their clustering results, we suggest several interesting and effective visualization techniques to reveal the important aspects of time-varying data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658174/","LOCKED","4658174","VIDI research group, Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, CA, USA","","VIDI research group, Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, CA, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37405886900","1","Chaoli Wang","37405886900","VIDI research group, Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, CA, USA","","VIDI research group, Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, CA, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37401024100","2","Hongfeng Yu","37401024100","VIDI research group, Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, CA, USA","VIDI research group, Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, CA, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275869400","3","Kwan-Liu Ma","37275869400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","109","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.140","1927","1554","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658174/","Index Terms—","Time-varying data","","","conditional entropy","joint feature-temporal space","clustering","highlighting","transfer function.","","","","Data visualization","Entropy","","Transfer functions","Information theory","Time measurement","Chaos","Data engineering","Data analysis","Information analysis","Earthquakes","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658174","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","10","1547","Importance-Driven Time-Varying Data Visualization","14"
"Scatterplots are well established means of visualizing discrete data values with two data variables as a collection of discrete points. We aim at generalizing the concept of scatterplots to the visualization of spatially continuous input data by a continuous and dense plot. An example of a continuous input field is data defined on an n-D spatial grid with respective interpolation or reconstruction of in-between values. We propose a rigorous, accurate, and generic mathematical model of continuous scatterplots that considers an arbitrary density defined on an input field on an n-D domain and that maps this density to m-D scatterplots. Special cases are derived from this generic model and discussed in detail: scatterplots where the n-D spatial domain and the m-D data attribute domain have identical dimension, 1-D scatterplots as a way to define continuous histograms, and 2-D scatterplots of data on 3-D spatial grids. We show how continuous histograms are related to traditional discrete histograms and to the histograms of isosurface statistics. Based on the mathematical model of continuous scatterplots, respective visualization algorithms are derived, in particular for 2-D scatterplots of data from 3-D tetrahedral grids. For several visualization tasks, we show the applicability of continuous scatterplots. Since continuous scatterplots do not only sample data at grid points but interpolate data values within cells, a denseand complete visualization of the data set is achieved that scales well with increasing data set size. Especially for irregular grids with varying cell size, improved results are obtained when compared to conventional scatterplots. Therefore, continuous scatterplots are a suitable extension of a statistics visualization technique to be applied to typical data from scientific computation.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658159/","LOCKED","4658159","VISUS (Visualization Research Center), Universität Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany","","VISUS (Visualization Research Center), Universität Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869985900","1","Sven Bachthaler","37869985900","VISUS (Visualization Research Center), Universität Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany","","VISUS (Visualization Research Center), Universität Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268045000","2","Daniel Weiskopf","37268045000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","107","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.119","1159","1435","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658159/","Index Terms—","Scatterplot","","","histogram","continuous frequency plot","interpolation","","","","","","Scattering","Data visualization","","Histograms","Interpolation","Mathematical model","Statistics","Frequency","Computer Society","Isosurfaces","Displays","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658159","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","11","1428","Continuous Scatterplots","14"
"Existing treemap layout algorithms suffer to some extent from poor or inconsistent mappings between data order and visual ordering in their representation, reducing their cognitive plausibility. While attempts have been made to quantify this mismatch, and algorithms proposed to minimize inconsistency, solutions provided tend to concentrate on one-dimensional ordering. We propose extensions to the existing squarified layout algorithm that exploit the two-dimensional arrangement of treemap nodes more effectively. Our proposed spatial squarified layout algorithm provides a more consistent arrangement of nodes while maintaining low aspect ratios. It is suitable for the arrangement of data with a geographic component and can be used to create tessellated cartograms for geovisualization. Locational consistency is measured and visualized and a number of layout algorithms are compared. CIELab color space and displacement vector overlays are used to assess and emphasize the spatial layout of treemap nodes. A case study involving locations of tagged photographs in the Flickr database is described.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658149/","LOCKED","4658149","School of Informatics, City University, London, UK","","School of Informatics, City University, London, UK","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399045100","1","Jo Wood","37399045100","School of Informatics, City University, London, UK","","School of Informatics, City University, London, UK","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37605079900","2","Jason Dykes","37605079900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","106","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.165","1428","1355","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658149/","Index Terms—","Geovisualization","","","Treemaps","Cartograms","CIELab","Geographic information","Tree structures","","","","Data visualization","Tree graphs","","Spatial databases","Visual databases","Tree data structures","Informatics","Impedance","Navigation","","","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658149","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","12","1348","Spatially Ordered Treemaps","14"
"We present an efficient and automatic image-recoloring technique for dichromats that highlights important visual details that would otherwise be unnoticed by these individuals. While previous techniques approach this problem by potentially changing all colors of the original image, causing their results to look unnatural to color vision deficients, our approach preserves, as much as possible, the image's original colors. Our approach is about three orders of magnitude faster than previous ones. The results of a paired-comparison evaluation carried out with fourteen color-vision deficients (CVDs) indicated the preference of our technique over the state-of-the-art automatic recoloring technique for dichromats. When considering information visualization examples, the subjects tend to prefer our results over the original images. An extension of our technique that exaggerates color contrast tends to be preferred when CVDs compared pairs of scientific visualization images. These results provide valuable information for guiding the design of visualizations for color-vision deficients.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658199/","LOCKED","4658199","Instituto de Informática, UFRGS","","Instituto de Informática, UFRGS","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37882399100","1","Giovane R.

"Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging is a unique tool for non-invasive investigation of major nerve fiber tracts. Since the popular diffusion tensor (DT-MRI) model is limited to voxels with a single fiber direction, a number of high angular resolution techniques have been proposed to provide information about more diverse fiber distributions. Two such approaches are Q-Ball imaging and spherical deconvolution, which produce orientation distribution functions (ODFs) on the sphere. For analysis and visualization, the maxima of these functions have been used as principal directions, even though the results are known to be biased in case of crossing fiber tracts. In this paper, we present a more reliable technique for extracting discrete orientations from continuous ODFs, which is based on decomposing their higher-order tensor representation into an isotropic component, several rank-1 terms, and a small residual. Comparing to ground truth in synthetic data shows that the novel method reduces bias and reliably reconstructs crossing fibers which are not resolved as individual maxima in the ODF. We present results on both Q-Ball and spherical deconvolution data and demonstrate that the estimated directions allow for plausible fiber tracking in a real data set.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658185/","LOCKED","4658185","MPI Informatik, Saarbruecken, Germany","","MPI Informatik, Saarbruecken, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606352800","1","Thomas Schultz","37606352800","MPI Informatik, Saarbruecken, Germany","","MPI Informatik, Saarbruecken, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271851300","2","Hans-Peter Seidel","37271851300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","91","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.128","754","1642","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658185/","Index Terms—","DW-MRI","","","Q-Ball","spherical deconvolution","fiber tracking","higher-order tensor","tensor decomposition.","","","","Tensile stress","Deconvolution","","Magnetic resonance imaging","Nerve fibers","Diffusion tensor imaging","High-resolution imaging","Distribution functions","Visualization","Data mining","Image reconstruction","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658185","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","14","1635","Estimating Crossing Fibers: A Tensor Decomposition Approach","14"
"Digital information displays are becoming more common in public spaces such as museums, galleries, and libraries. However, the public nature of these locations requires special considerations concerning the design of information visualization in terms of visual representations and interaction techniques. We discuss the potential for, and challenges of, information visualization in the museum context based on our practical experience with EMDialog, an interactive information presentation that was part of the Emily Carr exhibition at the Glenbow Museum in Calgary. EMDialog visualizes the diverse and multi-faceted discourse about this Canadian artist with the goal to both inform and provoke discussion. It provides a visual exploration environment that offers interplay between two integrated visualizations, one for information access along temporal, and the other along contextual dimensions. We describe the results of an observational study we conducted at the museum that revealed the different ways visitors approached and interacted with EMDialog, as well as how they perceived this form of information presentation in the museum context. Our results include the need to present information in a manner sufficiently attractive to draw attention and the importance of rewarding passive observation as well as both short- and longer term information exploration.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658128/","LOCKED","4658128","University of Calgary, Canada","","University of Calgary, Canada","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869968000","1","Uta Hinrichs","37869968000","","None","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37874733000","2","Holly Schmidt","37874733000","University of Calgary, Canada","University of Calgary, Canada","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37285000100","3","Sheelagh Carpendale","37285000100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","84","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.127","1560","1188","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658128/","Index Terms—","artistic information visualization","","","interactive information visualization","walk-up-and-use interaction","public displays.","","","","","","Displays","Data visualization","","Space technology","Art","Libraries","Information analysis","","","","","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658128","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","15","1181","EMDialog: Bringing Information Visualization into the Museum","14"
"Even though information visualization (InfoVis) research has matured in recent years, it is generally acknowledged that the field still lacks supporting, encompassing theories. In this paper, we argue that the distributed cognition framework can be used to substantiate the theoretical foundation of InfoVis. We highlight fundamental assumptions and theoretical constructs of the distributed cognition approach, based on the cognitive science literature and a real life scenario. We then discuss how the distributed cognition framework can have an impact on the research directions and methodologies we take as InfoVis researchers. Our contributions are as follows. First, we highlight the view that cognition is more an emergent property of interaction than a property of the human mind. Second, we argue that a reductionist approach to study the abstract properties of isolated human minds may not be useful in informing InfoVis design. Finally we propose to make cognition an explicit research agenda, and discuss the implications on how we perform evaluation and theory building.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658127/","LOCKED","4658127","School of Interactive Computing and the GVU Center, Georgia Institute of Technology","","School of Interactive Computing and the GVU Center, Georgia Institute of Technology","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592993600","1","Zhicheng Liu","37592993600","School of Interactive Computing and the School of Public Policy, Georgia Institute of Technology","","School of Interactive Computing and the School of Public Policy, Georgia Institute of Technology","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37412991300","2","Nancy Nersessian","37412991300","School of Interactive Computing and the GVU Center, Georgia Institute of Technology","School of Interactive Computing and the GVU Center, Georgia Institute of Technology","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267736900","3","John Stasko","37267736900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","83","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.121","2223","1180","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658127/","Index Terms—","Information visualization","","","distributed cognition","interaction","representation","theory and methods","","","","","Cognition","Humans","","Cognitive science","Data visualization","Electronic mail","Testing","Performance evaluation","Buildings","Distributed computing","Guidelines","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658127","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","16","1173","Distributed Cognition as a Theoretical Framework for Information Visualization","14"
"Professional designers and artists are quite cognizant of the rules that guide the design of effective color palettes, from both aesthetic and attention-guiding points of view. In the field of visualization, however, the use of systematic rules embracing these aspects has received less attention. The situation is further complicated by the fact that visualization often uses semi-transparencies to reveal occluded objects, in which case the resulting color mixing effects add additional constraints to the choice of the color palette. Color design forms a crucial part in visual aesthetics. Thus, the consideration of these issues can be of great value in the emerging field of illustrative visualization. We describe a knowledge-based system that captures established color design rules into a comprehensive interactive framework, aimed to aid users in the selection of colors for scene objects and incorporating individual preferences, importance functions, and overall scene composition. Our framework also offers new knowledge and solutions for the mixing, ordering and choice of colors in the rendering of semi-transparent layers and surfaces. All design rules are evaluated via user studies, for which we extend the method of conjoint analysis to task-based testing scenarios. Our framework's use of principles rooted in color design with application for the illustration of features in pre-classified data distinguishes it from existing systems which target the exploration of continuous-range density data via perceptual color maps.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658198/","LOCKED","4658198","Center for Visual Computing, Stony Brook University, USA","","Center for Visual Computing, Stony Brook University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37280763200","1","Lujin Wang","37280763200","Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena","","Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37325999500","2","Joachim Giesen","37325999500","Dowling College","Dowling College","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37882660300","3","Kevin T.

"Systems biologists use interaction graphs to model the behavior of biological systems at the molecular level. In an iterative process, such biologists observe the reactions of living cells under various experimental conditions, view the results in the context of the interaction graph, and then propose changes to the graph model. These graphs serve as a form of dynamic knowledge representation of the biological system being studied and evolve as new insight is gained from the experimental data. While numerous graph layout and drawing packages are available, these tools did not fully meet the needs of our immunologist collaborators. In this paper, we describe the data information display needs of these immunologists and translate them into design decisions. These decisions led us to create Cerebral, a system that uses a biologically guided graph layout and incorporates experimental data directly into the graph display. Small multiple views of different experimental conditions and a data-driven parallel coordinates view enable correlations between experimental conditions to be analyzed at the same time that the data is viewed in the graph context. This combination of coordinated views allows the biologist to view the data from many different perspectives simultaneously. To illustrate the typical analysis tasks performed, we analyze two datasets using Cerebral. Based on feedback from our collaborators we conclude that Cerebral is a valuable tool for analyzing experimental data in the context of an interaction graph model.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658137/","LOCKED","4658137","Department of Computer Science, University of British Columbia, Canada","","Department of Computer Science, University of British Columbia, Canada","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869962900","1","Aaron Barsky","37869962900","Department of Computer Science, University of British Columbia, Canada","","Department of Computer Science, University of British Columbia, Canada","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349490300","2","Tamara Munzner","37349490300","Centre for Microbial Diseases and Immunity Research, University of British Columbia, Canada","Centre for Microbial Diseases and Immunity Research, University of British Columbia, Canada","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869963200","3","Jennifer Gardy","37869963200","Agilent Laboratories, Agilent Technologies, Inc., USA","Agilent Laboratories, Agilent Technologies, Inc., USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37587984100","4","Robert Kincaid","37587984100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","77","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.117","975","1260","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658137/","Index Terms—","Graph layout","","","systems biology visualization","small multiples","design study","","","","","","Visualization","Biological system modeling","","Biological systems","Context modeling","Immune system","Collaborative tools","Displays","Performance analysis","Data analysis","Cells (biology)","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658137","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","18","1253","Cerebral: Visualizing Multiple Experimental Conditions on a Graph with Biological Context","14"
"Interaction cost is an important but poorly understood factor in visualization design. We propose a framework of interaction costs inspired by Normanpsilas Seven Stages of Action to facilitate study. From 484 papers, we collected 61 interaction-related usability problems reported in 32 user studies and placed them into our framework of seven costs: (1) Decision costs to form goals; (2) system-power costs to form system operations; (3) Multiple input mode costs to form physical sequences; (4) Physical-motion costs to execute sequences; (5) Visual-cluttering costs to perceive state; (6) View-change costs to interpret perception; (7) State-change costs to evaluate interpretation. We also suggested ways to narrow the gulfs of execution (2-4) and evaluation (5-7) based on collected reports. Our framework suggests a need to consider decision costs (1) as the gulf of goal formation.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658124/","LOCKED","4658124","University of British Columbia, Canada","","University of British Columbia, Canada","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37873130000","1","Heidi Lam","37873130000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","77","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.109","1520","1156","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658124/","Index Terms—","Interaction","","","Information Visualization","Framework","Interface Evaluation","","","","","","Costs","Visualization","","Navigation","Usability","Taxonomy","Encoding","Particle measurements","User interfaces","Crystallization","Mice","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658124","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","19","1149","A Framework of Interaction Costs in Information Visualization","14"
"The nature of an information visualization can be considered to lie in the visual metaphors it uses to structure information. The process of understanding a visualization therefore involves an interaction between these external visual metaphors and the user's internal knowledge representations. To investigate this claim, we conducted an experiment to test the effects of visual metaphor and verbal metaphor on the understanding of tree visualizations. Participants answered simple data comprehension questions while viewing either a treemap or a node-link diagram. Questions were worded to reflect a verbal metaphor that was either compatible or incompatible with the visualization a participant was using. The results suggest that the visual metaphor indeed affects how a user derives information from a visualization. Additionally, we found that the degree to which a user is affected by the metaphor is strongly correlated with the user's ability to answer task questions correctly. These findings are a first step towards illuminating how visual metaphors shape user understanding, and have significant implications for the evaluation, application, and theory of visualization.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658138/","LOCKED","4658138","UNC-Charlotte","","UNC-Charlotte","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37548028800","1","Caroline Ziemkiewicz","37548028800","UNC-Charlotte","","UNC-Charlotte","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282563400","2","Robert Kosara","37282563400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","72","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.171","1547","1276","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658138/","Index Terms—","Cognition","","","visualization theory","metaphors","hierarchies","evaluation","","","","","Data visualization","Shape","","Delay","Tree graphs","Knowledge representation","Testing","Cognition","Usability","Performance evaluation","","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658138","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","20","1269","The Shaping of Information by Visual Metaphors","14"
"Visualization of volumetric data faces the difficult task of finding effective parameters for the transfer functions. Those parameters can determine the effectiveness and accuracy of the visualization. Frequently, volumetric data includes multiple structures and features that need to be differentiated. However, if those features have the same intensity and gradient values, existing transfer functions are limited at effectively illustrating those similar features with different rendering properties. We introduce texture-based transfer functions for direct volume rendering. In our approach, the voxelpsilas resulting opacity and color are based on local textural properties rather than individual intensity values. For example, if the intensity values of the vessels are similar to those on the boundary of the lungs, our texture-based transfer function will analyze the textural properties in those regions and color them differently even though they have the same intensity values in the volume. The use of texture-based transfer functions has several benefits. First, structures and features with the same intensity and gradient values can be automatically visualized with different rendering properties. Second, segmentation or prior knowledge of the specific features within the volume is not required for classifying these features differently. Third, textural metrics can be combined and/or maximized to capture and better differentiate similar structures. We demonstrate our texture-based transfer function for direct volume rendering with synthetic and real-world medical data to show the strength of our technique.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658151/","LOCKED","4658151","Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland (UMBC), USA","","Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland (UMBC), USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37541275000","1","Jesus J.

"Many graph layout algorithms optimize visual characteristics to achieve useful representations. Implicitly, their goal is to create visual representations that are more intuitive to human observers. In this paper, we asked users to explicitly manipulate nodes in a network diagram to create layouts that they felt best captured the relationships in the data. This allowed us to measure organizational behavior directly, allowing us to evaluate the perceptual importance of particular visual features, such as edge crossings and edge-lengths uniformity. We also manipulated the interior structure of the node relationships by designing data sets that contained clusters, that is, sets of nodes that are strongly interconnected. By varying the degree to which these clusters were “masked” by extraneous edges we were able to measure observers’ sensitivity to the existence of clusters and how they revealed them in the network diagram. Based on these measurements we found that observers are able to recover cluster structure, that the distance between clusters is inversely related to the strength of the clustering, and that users exhibit the tendency to use edges to visually delineate perceptual groups. These results demonstrate the role of perceptual organization in representing graph data and provide concrete recommendations for graph layout algorithms.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658147/","LOCKED","4658147","IBM Research Cambridge, MA, USA","","IBM Research Cambridge, MA, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37326291000","1","Frank van Ham","37326291000","IBM Research Hawthorne, NY, USA","","IBM Research Hawthorne, NY, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37332114400","2","Bernice Rogowitz","37332114400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","61","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.155","746","1339","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658147/","Index Terms—","Network layout visualization","","","perceptual organization","graph layout","user studies","","","","","","Humans","Clustering algorithms","","Algorithm design and analysis","Particle measurements","Concrete","Data visualization","Neural networks","Communication networks","Social network services","Performance analysis","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658147","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","22","1333","Perceptual Organization in User-Generated Graph Layouts","14"
"Radviz is a radial visualization with dimensions assigned to points called dimensional anchors (DAs) placed on the circumference of a circle. Records are assigned locations within the circle as a function of its relative attraction to each of the DAs. The DAs can be moved either interactively or algorithmically to reveal different meaningful patterns in the dataset. In this paper we describe Vectorized Radviz (VRV) which extends the number of dimensions through data flattening. We show how VRV increases the power of Radviz through these extra dimensions by enhancing the flexibility in the layout of the DAs. We apply VRV to the problem of analyzing the results of multiple clusterings of the same data set, called multiple cluster sets or cluster ensembles.

"Building visualization and analysis pipelines is a large hurdle in the adoption of visualization and workflow systems by domain scientists. In this paper, we propose techniques to help users construct pipelines by consensus-automatically suggesting completions based on a database of previously created pipelines. In particular, we compute correspondences between existing pipeline subgraphs from the database, and use these to predict sets of likely pipeline additions to a given partial pipeline. By presenting these predictions in a carefully designed interface, users can create visualizations and other data products more efficiently because they can augment their normal work patterns with the suggested completions. We present an implementation of our technique in a publicly-available, open-source scientific workflow system and demonstrate efficiency gains in real-world situations.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658192/","LOCKED","4658192","School of Computing, University of Utah, USA","","School of Computing, University of Utah, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37647314800","1","D.

"Point placement strategies aim at mapping data points represented in higher dimensions to bi-dimensional spaces and are frequently used to visualize relationships amongst data instances. They have been valuable tools for analysis and exploration of data sets of various kinds. Many conventional techniques, however, do not behave well when the number of dimensions is high, such as in the case of documents collections. Later approaches handle that shortcoming, but may cause too much clutter to allow flexible exploration to take place. In this work we present a novel hierarchical point placement technique that is capable of dealing with these problems. While good grouping and separation of data with high similarity is maintained without increasing computation cost, its hierarchical structure lends itself both to exploration in various levels of detail and to handling data in subsets, improving analysis capability and also allowing manipulation of larger data sets.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658134/","LOCKED","4658134","ICMC, Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computaçãao, University of São Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil","","ICMC, Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computaçãao, University of São Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590969400","1","Fernando V.

"The visualization and exploration of multivariate data is still a challenging task. Methods either try to visualize all variablessimultaneously at each position using glyph-based approaches or use linked views for the interaction between attribute space andphysical domain such as brushing of scatterplots. Most visualizations of the attribute space are either difficult to understand or sufferfrom visual clutter. We propose a transformation of the high-dimensional data in attribute space to 2D that results in a point cloud,called attribute cloud, such that points with similar multivariate attributes are located close to each other. The transformation isbased on ideas from multivariate density estimation and manifold learning. The resulting attribute cloud is an easy to understandvisualization of multivariate data in two dimensions. We explain several techniques to incorporate additional information into theattribute cloud, that help the user get a better understanding of multivariate data. Using different examples from fluid dynamics andclimate simulation, we show how brushing can be used to explore the attribute cloud and find interesting structures in physical space.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658163/","LOCKED","4658163","Universität Leipzig","","Universität Leipzig","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37393638200","1","Heike Jänicke","37393638200","German Climate Computing Center","","German Climate Computing Center","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869987100","2","Michael Böttinger","37869987100","Universität Leipzig","Universität Leipzig","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282574800","3","Gerik Scheuermann","37282574800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","54","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.116","935","1466","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658163/","Index Terms—","Multivariate data","","","brushing","data transformation","manifold learning","linked views.","","","","","Clouds","Data visualization","","Scattering","Fluid dynamics","Principal component analysis","Temperature","","","","","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658163","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","26","1459","Brushing of Attribute Clouds for the Visualization of Multivariate Data","14"
"Understanding fluid flow data, especially vortices, is still a challenging task. Sophisticated visualization tools help to gain insight. In this paper, we present a novel approach for the interactive comparison of scalar fields using isosurfaces, and its application to fluid flow datasets. Features in two scalar fields are defined by largest contour segmentation after topological simplification. These features are matched using a volumetric similarity measure based on spatial overlap of individual features. The relationships defined by this similarity measure are ranked and presented in a thumbnail gallery of feature pairs and a graph representation showing all relationships between individual contours. Additionally, linked views of the contour trees are provided to ease navigation. The main render view shows the selected features overlapping each other. Thus, by displaying individual features and their relationships in a structured fashion, we enable exploratory visualization of correlations between similar structures in two scalar fields. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by applying it to a number of complex fluid flow datasets, where the emphasis is put on the comparison of vortex related scalar quantities.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658165/","LOCKED","4658165","University of Leipzig, Germany","","University of Leipzig, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869538100","1","Dominic Schneider","37869538100","University of Leipzig, Germany","","University of Leipzig, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37565763400","2","Alexander Wiebel","37565763400","University College Dublin, Ireland","University College Dublin, Ireland","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282624500","3","Hamish Carr","37282624500","University of Leipzig, Germany","University of Leipzig, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403333700","4","Mario Hlawitschka","37403333700","University of Leipzig, Germany","University of Leipzig, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282574800","5","Gerik Scheuermann","37282574800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","51","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.143","582","1482","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658165/","Index Terms—","Scalar topology","","","comparative visualization","contour tree","largest contours","flow visualization","","","","","Data visualization","Isosurfaces","","Fluid flow","Tree graphs","Data mining","Computer vision","Volume measurement","Navigation","Topology","Shape","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658165","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","27","1475","Interactive Comparison of Scalar Fields Based on Largest Contours with Applications to Flow Visualization","14"

Our approach is applicable to all triangulated models and we demonstrate its performance on architectural and outdoor models with tens or hundreds of thousands of triangles and moving objects.

"Parallel coordinate plots (PCPs) are commonly used in information visualization to provide insight into multi-variate data. These plots help to spot correlations between variables. PCPs have been successfully applied to unstructured datasets up to a few millions of points. In this paper, we present techniques to enhance the usability of PCPs for the exploration of large, multi-timepoint volumetric data sets, containing tens of millions of points per timestep. The main difficulties that arise when applying PCPs to large numbers of data points are visual clutter and slow performance, making interactive exploration infeasible. Moreover, the spatial context of the volumetric data is usually lost. We describe techniques for preprocessing using data quantization and compression, and for fast GPU-based rendering of PCPs using joint density distributions for each pair of consecutive variables, resulting in a smooth, continuous visualization. Also, fast brushing techniques are proposed for interactive data selection in multiple linked views, including a 3D spatial volume view. These techniques have been successfully applied to three large data sets: Hurricane Isabel (Vis'04 contest), the ionization front instability data set (Vis'08 design contest), and data from a large-eddy simulation of cumulus clouds. With these data, we show how PCPs can be extended to successfully visualize and interactively explore multi-timepoint volumetric datasets with an order of magnitude more data points.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658160/","LOCKED","4658160","Data Visualization Group, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands","","Data Visualization Group, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550793100","1","Jorik Blaas","37550793100","Data Visualization Group, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands","","Data Visualization Group, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37373834100","2","Charl Botha","37373834100","Data Visualization Group, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands","Data Visualization Group, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295045800","3","Frits Post","37295045800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","50","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.131","790","1451","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658160/","Index Terms—","Parallel coordinate plots","","","time-varying","multi-field","linked related views.","","","","","","Data visualization","Quantization","","Data analysis","Scattering","Scalability","Usability","Data preprocessing","Hurricanes","Ionization","Clouds","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658160","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","29","1436","Extensions of Parallel Coordinates for Interactive Exploration of Large Multi-Timepoint Data Sets","14"
"We present a novel approach for the direct computation of integral surfaces in time-dependent vector fields. As opposed to previous work, which we analyze in detail, our approach is based on a separation of integral surface computation into two stages: surface approximation and generation of a graphical representation. This allows us to overcome several limitations of existing techniques. We first describe an algorithm for surface integration that approximates a series of time lines using iterative refinement and computes a skeleton of the integral surface. In a second step, we generate a well-conditioned triangulation. Our approach allows a highly accurate treatment of very large time-varying vector fields in an efficient, streaming fashion. We examine the properties of the presented methods on several example datasets and perform a numerical study of its correctness and accuracy. Finally, we investigate some visualization aspects of integral surfaces.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658156/","LOCKED","4658156","Institute of Data Analysis and Visualization, University of California, Davis, USA","","Institute of Data Analysis and Visualization, University of California, Davis, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282573700","1","Christoph Garth","37282573700","Institute of Data Analysis and Visualization, University of California, Davis, USA","","Institute of Data Analysis and Visualization, University of California, Davis, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38556273200","2","Han Krishnan","38556273200","Computer Science Dept., Purdue University, USA","Computer Science Dept., Purdue University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282575100","3","Xavier Tricoche","37282575100","Geometric Algorithms Group, University of Kaiserslautern","Geometric Algorithms Group, University of Kaiserslautern","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37728450600","4","Tom Bobach","37728450600","Institute of Data Analysis and Visualization, University of California, Davis, USA","Institute of Data Analysis and Visualization, University of California, Davis, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267811400","5","Kenneth I.

"This paper proposes novel methods for visualizing specifically the large power-law graphs that arise in sociology and the sciences. In such cases a large portion of edges can be shown to be less important and removed while preserving component connectedness and other features (e.g. cliques) to more clearly reveal the networkpsilas underlying connection pathways. This simplification approach deterministically filters (instead of clustering) the graph to retain important node and edge semantics, and works both automatically and interactively. The improved graph filtering and layout is combined with a novel computer graphics anisotropic shading of the dense crisscrossing array of edges to yield a full social network and scale-free graph visualization system. Both quantitative analysis and visual results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658141/","LOCKED","4658141","University of Illinois, USA","","University of Illinois, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37532721900","1","Yuntao Jia","37532721900","University of Illinois, USA","","University of Illinois, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869982300","2","Jared Hoberock","37869982300","NVidia Corporation","NVidia Corporation","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272036400","3","Michael Garland","37272036400","University of Illinois, USA","University of Illinois, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37301161800","4","John Hart","37301161800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","49","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.151","1216","1292","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658141/","Index Terms—","Scale-free network","","","edge filtering","betweenness centrality","anisotropic shading","","","","","","Visualization","Filtering","","Sociology","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Displays","Stochastic processes","Filters","Layout","Computer graphics","Social network services","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658141","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","31","1285","On the Visualization of Social and other Scale-Free Networks","14"
"Smoke rendering is a standard technique for flow visualization. Most approaches are based on a volumetric, particle based, or image based representation of the smoke. This paper introduces an alternative representation of smoke structures: as semi-transparent streak surfaces. In order to make streak surface integration fast enough for interactive applications, we avoid expensive adaptive retriangulations by coupling the opacity of the triangles to their shapes. This way, the surface shows a smoke-like look even in rather turbulent areas. Furthermore, we show modifications of the approach to mimic smoke nozzles, wool tufts, and time surfaces.

"Exploring communities is an impor tant task in social network analysis. Such communities are currently identified using clustering methods to group actors. This approach often leads to actors belonging to one and only one cluster, whereas in real life a person can belong to several communities. As a solution we propose duplicating actors in social networks and discuss potential impact of such a move. Several visual duplication designs are discussed and a controlled experiment comparing network visualization with and without duplication is performed, using 6 tasks that are impor tant for graph readability and visual interpretation of social networks. We show that in our experiment, duplications significantly improve community-related tasks but sometimes interfere with other graph readability tasks. Finally, we propose a set of guidelines for deciding when to duplicate actors and choosing candidates for duplication, and alternative ways to render them in social network representations.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658145/","LOCKED","4658145","INRIA-LRI and Univ. of Sydney","","INRIA-LRI and Univ. of Sydney","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087757168","1","Nathalie y Henr","37087757168","NICTA","","NICTA","NICTA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267832500","2","Anastasia Bezerianos","37267832500","INRIA","INRIA","INRIA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407972900","3","Jean-Daniel Fekete","37407972900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","45","2","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.141","801","1324","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658145/","Index Terms—","Clustering","","","Graph Visualization","Node Duplications","Social Networks","","","","","","Social network services","Clustering","","Layout","Communities","","","","","","","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658145","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","33","1317","Improving the Readability of Clustered Social Networks using Node Duplication","14"
"This paper presents a novel method for interactive exploration of industrial CT volumes such as cast metal parts, with the goal of interactively detecting, classifying, and quantifying features using a visualization-driven approach. The standard approach for defect detection builds on region growing, which requires manually tuning parameters such as target ranges for density and size, variance, as well as the specification of seed points. If the results are not satisfactory, region growing must be performed again with different parameters. In contrast, our method allows interactive exploration of the parameter space, completely separated from region growing in an unattended pre-processing stage. The pre-computed feature volume tracks a feature size curve for each voxelover time, which is identified with the main region growing parameter such as variance. A novel 3D transfer function domain over (density, feature size, time) allows for interactive exploration of feature classes. Features and feature size curves can also be explored individually, which helps with transfer function specification and allows coloring individual features and disabling features resulting from CT artifacts. Based on the classification obtained through exploration, the classified features can be quantified immediately.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658169/","LOCKED","4658169","VRVis Research Center, Austria","","VRVis Research Center, Austria","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37394809600","1","Markus Hadwiger","37394809600","VRVis Research Center, Austria","","VRVis Research Center, Austria","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087753518","2","Fritz Laura","37087753518","Computer Graphics Group, University of Siegen, Germany","Computer Graphics Group, University of Siegen, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38273544100","3","Christof Rezk-Salama","38273544100","Austrian Foundry Research Institute, Austria","Austrian Foundry Research Institute, Austria","VRVis Research Center, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37846851700","4","Thomas Höllt","37846851700","Austrian Foundry Research Institute, Austria","Austrian Foundry Research Institute, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869963700","5","Georg Geier","37869963700","Austrian Foundry Research Institute, Austria","Austrian Foundry Research Institute, Austria","VRVis Research Center, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38273712900","6","Thomas Pabel","38273712900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","44","2","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.147","711","1514","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658169/","Index Terms—","Non-Destructive Testing","","","Multi-Dimensional Transfer Functions","Region Growing","Volume Rendering","","","","","","Computer vision","Computed tomography","","Metals industry","Data visualization","Transfer functions","Nondestructive testing","Construction industry","Manufacturing industries","Automotive engineering","Building materials","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658169","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","34","1507","Interactive Volume Exploration for Feature Detection and Quantification in Industrial CT Data","14"
"One of the most prominent topics in climate research is the investigation, detection, and allocation of climate change. In this paper, we aim at identifying regions in the atmosphere (e.g., certain height layers) which can act as sensitive and robust indicators for climate change. We demonstrate how interactive visual data exploration of large amounts of multi-variate and time-dependent climate data enables the steered generation of promising hypotheses for subsequent statistical evaluation. The use of new visualization and interaction technology—in the context of a coordinated multiple views framework—allows not only to identify these promising hypotheses, but also to efficiently narrow down parameters that are required in the process of computational data analysis. Two datasets, namely an ECHAM5 climate model run and the ERA-40 reanalysis incorporating observational data, are investigated. Higher-order information such as linear trends or signal-to-noise ratio is derived and interactively explored in order to detect and explore those regions which react most sensitively to climate change. As one conclusion from this study, we identify an excellent potential for usefully generalizing our approach to other, similar application cases, as well.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658178/","LOCKED","4658178","Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Norway","","Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Norway","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546620000","1","Johannes Kehrer","37546620000","Wegener Center for Climate and Global Change (WegCenter) and the Institute for Geophysics, Astrophysics, and Meteorology (IGAM), University of Graz, Austria","","Wegener Center for Climate and Global Change (WegCenter) and the Institute for Geophysics, Astrophysics, and Meteorology (IGAM), University of Graz, Austria","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869982700","2","Florian Ladstädter","37869982700","VRVis Research Center, SimVis GmbH, Vienna, Austria","VRVis Research Center, SimVis GmbH, Vienna, Austria","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546620600","3","Philipp Muigg","37546620600","VRVis Research Center, SimVis GmbH, Vienna, Austria","VRVis Research Center, SimVis GmbH, Vienna, Austria","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546620400","4","Helmut Doleisch","37546620400","Wegener Center for Climate and Global Change (WegCenter) and the Institute for Geophysics, Astrophysics, and Meteorology (IGAM), University of Graz, Austria","Wegener Center for Climate and Global Change (WegCenter) and the Institute for Geophysics, Astrophysics, and Meteorology (IGAM), University of Graz, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089308969","5","Andrea Steiner","37089308969","Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Norway","Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Norway","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274158800","6","Helwig Hauser","37274158800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","44","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.139","678","1586","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658178/","Index Terms—","interactive visual hypothesis generation","","","interactive visual exploration and analysis","visualization for climate research.","","","","","","","Data visualization","Robustness","Climate change","Atmosphere","Data analysis","Signal to noise ratio","Weather forecasting","Atmospheric measurements","Extraterrestrial measurements","Geophysical measurements","Satellites","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658178","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","35","1579","Hypothesis Generation in Climate Research with Interactive Visual Data Exploration","14"
"We introduce a versatile framework for characterizing and extracting salient structures in three-dimensional symmetric second-order tensor fields. The key insight is that degenerate lines in tensor fields, as defined by the standard topological approach, are exactly crease (ridge and valley) lines of a particular tensor invariant called mode. This reformulation allows us to apply well-studied approaches from scientific visualization or computer vision to the extraction of topological lines in tensor fields. More generally, this main result suggests that other tensor invariants, such as anisotropy measures like fractional anisotropy (FA), can be used in the same framework in lieu of mode to identify important structural properties in tensor fields. Our implementation addresses the specific challenge posed by the non-linearity of the considered scalar measures and by the smoothness requirement of the crease manifold computation. We use a combination of smooth reconstruction kernels and adaptive refinement strategy that automatically adjust the resolution of the analysis to the spatial variation of the considered quantities. Together, these improvements allow for the robust application of existing ridge line extraction algorithms in the tensor context of our problem. Results are proposed for a diffusion tensor MRI dataset, and for a benchmark stress tensor field used in engineering research.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658184/","LOCKED","4658184","Computer Science Department, Purdue University, USA","","Computer Science Department, Purdue University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282575100","1","Xavier Tricoche","37282575100","Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School","","Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282742400","2","Gordon Kindlmann","37282742400","Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School","Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294318400","3","Carl-Fredrik Westin","37294318400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","43","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.148","369","1634","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658184/","Index Terms—","Tensor ﬁ","","","elds","tensor invariants","ridge lines","crease extraction","structural analysis","topology","","","Tensile stress","Topology","","Biomedical imaging","Computer vision","Data mining","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Magnetic resonance imaging","Data engineering","Data visualization","Hospitals","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658184","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","36","1627","Invariant Crease Lines for Topological and Structural Analysis of Tensor Fields","14"
"Methods that faithfully and robustly capture the geometry of complex material interfaces in labeled volume data are important for generating realistic and accurate visualizations and simulations of real-world objects. The generation of such multimaterial models from measured data poses two unique challenges: first, the surfaces must be well-sampled with regular, efficient tessellations that are consistent across material boundaries; and second, the resulting meshes must respect the nonmanifold geometry of the multimaterial interfaces. This paper proposes a strategy for sampling and meshing multimaterial volumes using dynamic particle systems, including a novel, differentiable representation of the material junctions that allows the particle system to explicitly sample corners, edges, and surfaces of material intersections. The distributions of particles are controlled by fundamental sampling constraints, allowing Delaunay-based meshing algorithms to reliably extract watertight meshes of consistently high-quality.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658173/","LOCKED","4658173","Initiative in Innovative Computing, Harvard University, USA","","Initiative in Innovative Computing, Harvard University, USA","Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564728700","1","Miriah Meyer","37564728700","Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA","","Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267322600","2","Ross Whitaker","37267322600","Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA","Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275716100","3","Robert M.

"A standard approach to large network visualization is to provide an overview of the network and a detailed view of a small component of the graph centred around a focal node. The user explores the network by changing the focal node in the detailed view or by changing the level of detail of a node or cluster. For scalability, fast force-based layout algorithms are used for the overview and the detailed view. However, using the same layout algorithm in both views is problematic since layout for the detailed view has different requirements to that in the overview. Here we present a model in which constrained graph layout algorithms are used for layout in the detailed view. This means the detailed view has high-quality layout including sophisticated edge routing and is customisable by the user who can add placement constraints on the layout. Scalability is still ensured since the slower layout techniques are only applied to the small subgraph shown in the detailed view. The main technical innovations are techniques to ensure that the overview and detailed view remain synchronized, and modifying constrained graph layout algorithms to support smooth, stable layout. The key innovation supporting stability are new dynamic graph layout algorithms that preserve the topology or structure of the network when the user changes the focus node or the level of detail by in situ semantic zooming. We have built a prototype tool and demonstrate its use in two application domains, UML class diagrams and biological networks.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658142/","LOCKED","4658142","Microsoft Research","","Microsoft Research","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37326161000","1","Tim Dwyer","37326161000","Monash University, Australia","","Monash University, Australia","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37354163600","2","Kim Marriott","37354163600","IPK-Gatersleben, Germany","IPK-Gatersleben, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37867195800","3","Falk Schreiber","37867195800","National ICT Australia, University of Melbourne, Australia","National ICT Australia, University of Melbourne, Australia","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37372661500","4","Peter Stuckey","37372661500","University of Melbourne, Australia","University of Melbourne, Australia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37269432800","5","Michael Woodward","37269432800","Monash University, Australia","Monash University, Australia","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37867777700","6","Michael Wybrow","37867777700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","42","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.130","659","1300","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658142/","Index Terms—","Graph drawing","","","constraints","stress majorization","force directed algorithms","multidimensional scaling.","","","","","Scalability","Clustering algorithms","","Technological innovation","Visualization","Routing","Stability","Heuristic algorithms","Network topology","Prototypes","Unified modeling language","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658142","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","38","1293","Exploration of Networks using overview+detail with Constraint-based cooperative layout","14"
"In many information visualization techniques, labels are an essential part to communicate the visualized data. To preserve the expressiveness of the visual representation, a placed label should neither occlude other labels nor visual representatives (e.g., icons, lines) that communicate crucial information. Optimal, non-overlapping labeling is an NP-hard problem. Thus, only a few approaches achieve a fast non-overlapping labeling in highly interactive scenarios like information visualization. These approaches generally target the point-feature label placement (PFLP) problem, solving only label-label conflicts. This paper presents a new, fast, solid and flexible 2D labeling approach for the PFLP problem that additionally respects other visual elements and the visual extent of labeled features. The results (number of placed labels, processing time) of our particle-based method compare favorably to those of existing techniques. Although the esthetic quality of non-real-time approaches may not be achieved with our method, it complies with practical demands and thus supports the interactive exploration of information spaces. In contrast to the known adjacent techniques, the flexibility of our technique enables labeling of dense point clouds by the use of non-occluding distant labels. Our approach is independent of the underlying visualization technique, which enables us to demonstrate the application of our labeling method within different information visualization scenarios.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658135/","LOCKED","4658135","University of Rostock, Germany","","University of Rostock, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869995900","1","Martin Luboschik","37869995900","University of Rostock, Germany","","University of Rostock, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283240400","2","Heidrun Schumann","37283240400","University of Rostock, Germany","University of Rostock, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869995100","3","Hilko Cords","37869995100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","41","2","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.152","688","1244","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658135/","Index Terms—","interactive labeling","","","dynamic labeling","automatic label placement","occlusion-free","information visualization","","","","","Labeling","Data visualization","","NP-hard problem","Pipelines","Solids","Space exploration","Clouds","Shape","","","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658135","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","39","1237","Particle-based labeling: Fast point-feature labeling without obscuring other visual features","14"
"Network data frequently arises in a wide variety of fields, and node-link diagrams are a very natural and intuitive representation of such data. In order for a node-link diagram to be effective, the nodes must be arranged well on the screen. While many graph layout algorithms exist for this purpose, they often have limitations such as high computational complexity or node colocation. This paper proposes a new approach to graph layout through the use of space filling curves which is very fast and guarantees that there will be no nodes that are colocated. The resulting layout is also aesthetic and satisfies several criteria for graph layout effectiveness.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658143/","LOCKED","4658143","University of California,슠Davis, Davis, CA, USA","","University of California,슠Davis, Davis, CA, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37299311900","1","Chris Muelder","37299311900","University of California Davis, Davis, CA, USA","","University of California Davis, Davis, CA, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275869400","2","Kwan-Liu Ma","37275869400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","41","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.158","907","1308","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658143/","Index Terms—","Information visualization","","","Graph layout","Space filling curves","","","","","","","Filling","Clustering algorithms","","Data visualization","Computational complexity","Social network services","Lenses","Tree graphs","","","","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658143","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","40","1301","Rapid Graph Layout Using Space Filling Curves","14"
"Ranking data, which result from m raters ranking n items, are difficult to visualize due to their discrete algebraic structure, and the computational difficulties associated with them when n is large. This problem becomes worse when raters provide tied rankings or not all items are ranked. We develop an approach for the visualization of ranking data for large n which is intuitive, easy to use, and computationally efficient. The approach overcomes the structural and computational difficulties by utilizing a natural measure of dissimilarity for rater, and projecting the raters into a low dimensional vector space where they are viewed. The visualization techniques are demonstrated using voting data, jokes, and movie preferences.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658150/","LOCKED","4658150","Department of Statistics, Purdue University, USA","","Department of Statistics, Purdue University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37865597100","1","Paul Kidwell","37865597100","College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA","","College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37427770800","2","Guy Lebanon","37427770800","Department of Statistics and Computer Science, Purdue University, USA","Department of Statistics and Computer Science, Purdue University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282344300","3","William Cleveland","37282344300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","40","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.181","786","1363","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658150/","Index Terms—","Partial rankings","","","incomplete rankings","multidimensional scaling","","","","","","","Data visualization","Voting","","Statistics","Extraterrestrial measurements","Motion pictures","Multidimensional systems","Search engines","Professional societies","Councils","Computer science","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658150","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","41","1356","Visualizing Incomplete and Partially Ranked Data","14"
"Recent results have shown a link between geometric properties of isosurfaces and statistical properties of the underlying sampled data. However, this has two defects: not all of the properties described converge to the same solution, and the statistics computed are not always invariant under isosurface-preserving transformations. We apply Federer's Coarea Formula from geometric measure theory to explain these discrepancies. We describe an improved substitute for histograms based on weighting with the inverse gradient magnitude, develop a statistical model that is invariant under isosurface-preserving transformations, and argue that this provides a consistent method for algorithm evaluation across multiple datasets based on histogram equalization. We use our corrected formulation to reevaluate recent results on average isosurface complexity, and show evidence that noise is one cause of the discrepancy between the expected figure and the observed one.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658188/","LOCKED","4658188","Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA","","Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550809300","1","Carlos E.

"We present a toolbox for quickly interpreting and illustrating 2D slices of seismic volumetric reflection data. Searching for oil and gas involves creating a structural overview of seismic reflection data to identify hydrocarbon reservoirs. We improve the search of seismic structures by precalculating the horizon structures of the seismic data prior to interpretation. We improve the annotation of seismic structures by applying novel illustrative rendering algorithms tailored to seismic data, such as deformed texturing and line and texture transfer functions. The illustrative rendering results in multi-attribute and scale invariant visualizations where features are represented clearly in both highly zoomed in and zoomed out views. Thumbnail views in combination with interactive appearance control allows for a quick overview of the data before detailed interpretation takes place. These techniques help reduce the work of seismic illustrators and interpreters.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658177/","LOCKED","4658177","Christian Michelsen Research, Bergen, Norway","","Christian Michelsen Research, Bergen, Norway","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37402844200","1","Daniel Patel","37402844200","Christian Michelsen Research, Bergen, Norway","","Christian Michelsen Research, Bergen, Norway","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37884872900","2","Christopher Giertsen","37884872900","StatoilHydro, Bergen, Norway","StatoilHydro, Bergen, Norway","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869961500","3","John Thurmond","37869961500","StatoilHydro, Bergen, Norway","StatoilHydro, Bergen, Norway","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869959900","4","John Gjelberg","37869959900","Vienna University of Technology, Austria","Vienna University of Technology, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284271200","5","Eduard Grøller","37284271200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","37","2","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.170","793","1578","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658177/","Index Terms—","Seismic interpretation","","","Illustrative rendering","Seismic attributes","Top-down interpretation","","","","","","Petroleum","Reflection","","Geophysical measurements","Seismic measurements","Drilling","Boring","Hydrocarbon reservoirs","Transfer functions","Data visualization","Energy consumption","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658177","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","43","1571","The Seismic Analyzer: Interpreting and Illustrating 2D Seismic Data","14"
"Interactive steering with visualization has been a common goal of the visualization research community for twenty years, but it is rarely ever realized in practice. In this paper we describe a successful realization of a tightly coupled steering loop, integrating new simulation technology and interactive visual analysis in a prototyping environment for automotive industry system design. Due to increasing pressure on car manufacturers to meet new emission regulations, to improve efficiency, and to reduce noise, both simulation and visualization are pushed to their limits. Automotive system components, such as the powertrain system or the injection system have an increasing number of parameters, and new design approaches are required. It is no longer possible to optimize such a system solely based on experience or forward optimization. By coupling interactive visualization with the simulation back-end (computational steering), it is now possible to quickly prototype a new system, starting from a non-optimized initial prototype and the corresponding simulation model. The prototyping continues through the refinement of the simulation model, of the simulation parameters and through trial-and-error attempts to an optimized solution. The ability to early see the first results from a multidimensional simulation space — thousands of simulations are run for a multidimensional variety of input parameters — and to quickly go back into the simulation and request more runs in particular parameter regions of interest significantly improves the prototyping process and provides a deeper understanding of the system behavior. The excellent results which we achieved for the common rail injection system strongly suggest that our approach has a great potential of being generalized to other, similar scenarios.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658193/","LOCKED","4658193","VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","","VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37947312900","1","Kresimir Matkovic","37947312900","Virginia Technology","","Virginia Technology","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37323697500","2","Denis Gracanin","37323697500","AVL AST, Zagreb, Croatia","AVL AST, Zagreb, Croatia","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085338297","3","Mario Jelovic","37085338297","University of Bergen, Norway","University of Bergen, Norway","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274158800","4","Helwig Hauser","37274158800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","37","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.145","476","1706","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658193/","Index Terms—","interactive computational steering","","","interactive visual analysis","simulation","common rail injection system","","","","","","Prototypes","Rails","","Virtual prototyping","Visualization","Computational modeling","Automotive engineering","Multidimensional systems","Analytical models","Manufacturing industries","System analysis and design","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658193","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","44","1699","Interactive Visual Steering - Rapid Visual Prototyping of a Common Rail Injection System","14"
"For difficult cases in endoscopic sinus surgery, a careful planning of the intervention is necessary. Due to the reduced field of view during the intervention, the surgeons have less information about the surrounding structures in the working area compared to open surgery. Virtual endoscopy enables the visualization of the operating field and additional information, such as risk structures (e.g., optical nerve and skull base) and target structures to be removed (e.g., mucosal swelling). The Sinus Endoscopy system provides the functional range of a virtual endoscopic system with special focus on a realistic representation. Furthermore, by using direct volume rendering, we avoid time-consuming segmentation steps for the use of individual patient datasets. However, the image quality of the endoscopic view can be adjusted in a way that a standard computer with a modern standard graphics card achieves interactive frame rates with low CPU utilization. Thereby, characteristics of the endoscopic view are systematically used for the optimization of the volume rendering speed. The system design was based on a careful analysis of the endoscopic sinus surgery and the resulting needs for computer support. As a small standalone application it can be instantly used for surgical planning and patient education. First results of a clinical evaluation with ENT surgeons were employed to fine-tune the user interface, in particular to reduce the number of controls by using appropriate default values wherever possible. The system was used for preoperative planning in 102 cases, provides useful information for intervention planning (e.g., anatomic variations of the Rec. Frontalis), and closely resembles the intraoperative situation.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658167/","LOCKED","4658167","Department of Simulation and Graphics, Otto-von-Guericke-University of Magdeburg, Germany","","Department of Simulation and Graphics, Otto-von-Guericke-University of Magdeburg, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088413533","1","Arno Kruger","37088413533","Department of Simulation and Graphics, Otto-von-Guericke-University of Magdeburg, Germany","","Department of Simulation and Graphics, Otto-von-Guericke-University of Magdeburg, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869714800","2","Christoph Kubisch","37869714800","ENT Department, University Hospital of Leipzig","ENT Department, University Hospital of Leipzig","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37424645300","3","Bernhard Preim","37424645300","Department of Simulation and Graphics, Otto-von-Guericke-University of Magdeburg, Germany","Department of Simulation and Graphics, Otto-von-Guericke-University of Magdeburg, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546436800","4","Gero Strauss","37546436800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","33","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.161","559","1498","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658167/","Index Terms—","medical visualization","","","sinus surgery","operationplanning","virtual endoscopy","volume rendering","","","","","Endoscopes","Surgery","","Rendering (computer graphics)","Visualization","Biomedical optical imaging","Skull","Image segmentation","Image quality","Computer graphics","System analysis and design","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658167","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","45","1491","Sinus Endoscopy - Application of Advanced GPU Volume Rendering for Virtual Endoscopy","14"
"Traditional geospatial information visualizations often present views that restrict the user to a single perspective. When zoomed out, local trends and anomalies become suppressed and lost; when zoomed in for local inspection, spatial awareness and comparison between regions become limited. In our model, coordinated visualizations are integrated within individual probe interfaces, which depict the local data in user-defined regions-of-interest. Our probe concept can be incorporated into a variety of geospatial visualizations to empower users with the ability to observe, coordinate, and compare data across multiple local regions. It is especially useful when dealing with complex simulations or analyses where behavior in various localities differs from other localities and from the system as a whole. We illustrate the effectiveness of our technique over traditional interfaces by incorporating it within three existing geospatial visualization systems: an agent-based social simulation, a census data exploration tool, and an 3D GIS environment for analyzing urban change over time. In each case, the probe-based interaction enhances spatial awareness, improves inspection and comparison capabilities, expands the range of scopes, and facilitates collaboration among multiple users.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658126/","LOCKED","4658126","UNC Charlotte, The Charlotte Visualization Center","","UNC Charlotte, The Charlotte Visualization Center","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591215700","1","Thomas Butkiewicz","37591215700","UNC Charlotte, The Charlotte Visualization Center","","UNC Charlotte, The Charlotte Visualization Center","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606064200","2","Wenwen Dou","37606064200","UNC Charlotte, The Charlotte Visualization Center","UNC Charlotte, The Charlotte Visualization Center","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37297344900","3","Zachary Wartell","37297344900","UNC Charlotte, The Charlotte Visualization Center","UNC Charlotte, The Charlotte Visualization Center","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300425000","4","William Ribarsky","37300425000","UNC Charlotte, The Charlotte Visualization Center","UNC Charlotte, The Charlotte Visualization Center","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592409400","5","Remco Chang","37592409400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","32","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.149","584","1172","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658126/","Index Terms—","Multiple-view techniques","","","geospatial visualization","geospatial analysis","focus + context","probes","","","","","Probes","","","","","","","","","","","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658126","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","46","1165","Multi-Focused Geospatial Analysis Using Probes","14"
"Extracting and visualizing temporal patterns in large scientific data is an open problem in visualization research. First, there are few proven methods to flexibly and concisely define general temporal patterns for visualization. Second, with large time-dependent data sets, as typical with todaypsilas large-scale simulations, scalable and general solutions for handling the data are still not widely available. In this work, we have developed a textual pattern matching approach for specifying and identifying general temporal patterns. Besides defining the formalism of the language, we also provide a working implementation with sufficient efficiency and scalability to handle large data sets. Using recent large-scale simulation data from multiple application domains, we demonstrate that our visualization approach is one of the first to empower a concept driven exploration of large-scale time-varying multivariate data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658164/","LOCKED","4658164","University of Tennessee, Knoxville, USA","","University of Tennessee, Knoxville, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37828700000","1","Markus Glatter","37828700000","University of Tennessee, Knoxville, USA","","University of Tennessee, Knoxville, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37281262900","2","Jian Huang","37281262900","Oak Ridge National Laboratory","Oak Ridge National Laboratory","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37410066100","3","Sean Ahern","37410066100","Oak Ridge National Laboratory","Oak Ridge National Laboratory","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37672397100","4","Jamison Daniel","37672397100","North Carolina State University, Charlotte, USA","North Carolina State University, Charlotte, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37545504600","5","Aidong Lu","37545504600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","31","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.184","568","1474","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658164/","Index Terms—","Multivariate visualization","","","Time-varying","Uncertainty","","","","","","","Data visualization","Uncertainty","","Large-scale systems","Pattern matching","Data mining","Scalability","Computational modeling","Capacitive sensors","Displays","Testing","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658164","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","47","1467","Visualizing Temporal Patterns in Large Multivariate Data using Modified Globbing","14"
"This paper presents a novel and efficient surface matching and visualization framework through the geodesic distance-weighted shape vector image diffusion. Based on conformal geometry, our approach can uniquely map a 3D surface to a canonical rectangular domain and encode the shape characteristics (e.g., mean curvatures and conformal factors) of the surface in the 2D domain to construct a geodesic distance-weighted shape vector image, where the distances between sampling pixels are not uniform but the actual geodesic distances on the manifold. Through the novel geodesic distance-weighted shape vector image diffusion presented in this paper, we can create a multiscale diffusion space, in which the cross-scale extrema can be detected as the robust geometric features for the matching and registration of surfaces. Therefore, statistical analysis and visualization of surface properties across subjects become readily available. The experiments on scanned surface models show that our method is very robust for feature extraction and surface matching even under noise and resolution change. We have also applied the framework on the real 3D human neocortical surfaces, and demonstrated the excellent performance of our approach in statistical analysis and integrated visualization of the multimodality volumetric data over the shape vector image.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658186/","LOCKED","4658186","Wayne State University, USA","","Wayne State University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37285799200","1","Jing Hua","37285799200","Wayne State University, USA","","Wayne State University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37868989800","2","Zhaoqiang Lai","37868989800","Wayne State University, USA","Wayne State University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37290589700","3","Ming Dong","37290589700","Stony Brook University, USA","Stony Brook University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37276603700","4","Xianfeng Gu","37276603700","Stony Brook University, USA","Stony Brook University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37276553900","5","Hong Qin","37276553900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","31","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.134","418","1650","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658186/","Index Terms—","Surface Matching","","","Shape Vector Image","Multiscale Diffusion","Visualization","","","","","","Shape","Visualization","","Noise robustness","Statistical analysis","Geometry","Image sampling","Pixel","Feature extraction","Multi-stage noise shaping","Humans","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658186","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","48","1643","Geodesic Distance-weighted Shape Vector Image Diffusion","14"
"The need to examine and manipulate large surface models is commonly found in many science, engineering, and medical applications. On a desktop monitor, however, seeing the whole model in detail is not possible. In this paper, we present a new, interactive Focus+Context method for visualizing large surface models. Our method, based on an energy optimization model, allows the user to magnify an area of interest to see it in detail while deforming the rest of the area without perceivable distortion. The rest of the surface area is essentially shrunk to use as little of the screen space as possible in order to keep the entire model displayed on screen.

"Data sets resulting from physical simulations typically contain a multitude of physical variables. It is, therefore, desirable that visualization methods take into account the entire multi-field volume data rather than concentrating on one variable. We present a visualization approach based on surface extraction from multi-field particle volume data. The surfaces segment the data with respect to the underlying multi-variate function. Decisions on segmentation properties are based on the analysis of the multi-dimensional feature space. The feature space exploration is performed by an automated multi-dimensional hierarchical clustering method, whose resulting density clusters are shown in the form of density level sets in a 3D star coordinate layout. In the star coordinate layout, the user can select clusters of interest. A selected cluster in feature space corresponds to a segmenting surface in object space. Based on the segmentation property induced by the cluster membership, we extract a surface from the volume data. Our driving applications are smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations, where each particle carries multiple properties. The data sets are given in the form of unstructured point-based volume data. We directly extract our surfaces from such data without prior resampling or grid generation. The surface extraction computes individual points on the surface, which is supported by an efficient neighborhood computation. The extracted surface points are rendered using point-based rendering operations. Our approach combines methods in scientific visualization for object-space operations with methods in information visualization for feature-space operations.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658166/","LOCKED","4658166","School of Engineering and Science, Jacobs University, Bremen, Germany","","School of Engineering and Science, Jacobs University, Bremen, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266826500","1","Lars Linsen","37266826500","School of Engineering and Science, Jacobs University, Bremen, Germany","","School of Engineering and Science, Jacobs University, Bremen, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590653700","2","Tran Van Long","37590653700","School of Engineering and Science, Jacobs University, Bremen, Germany","School of Engineering and Science, Jacobs University, Bremen, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37643113600","3","Paul Rosenthal","37643113600","School of Engineering and Science, Jacobs University, Bremen, Germany","School of Engineering and Science, Jacobs University, Bremen, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869996100","4","Stephan Rosswog","37869996100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","30","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.167","657","1490","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658166/","Index Terms—","Multi-field and multi-variate visualization","","","isosurfaces and surface extraction","point-based visualization","star coordinates","visualization in astrophysics","particle simulations.","","","","Data mining","Data visualization","","Hydrodynamics","Computational modeling","Astrophysics","Interpolation","Sampling methods","Space exploration","Clustering methods","Level set","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658166","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","50","1483","Surface Extraction from Multi-field Particle Volume Data Using Multi-dimensional Cluster Visualization","14"
"The effective visualization of vascular structures is critical for diagnosis, surgical planning as well as treatment evaluation. In recent work, we have developed an algorithm for vessel detection that examines the intensity profile around each voxel in an angiographic image and determines the likelihood that any given voxel belongs to a vessel; we term this the ""vesselness coefficient"" of the voxel. Our results show that our algorithm works particularly well for visualizing branch points in vessels. Compared to standard Hessian based techniques, which are fine-tuned to identify long cylindrical structures, our technique identifies branches and connections with other vessels. Using our computed vesselness coefficient, we explore a set of techniques for visualizing vasculature. Visualizing vessels is particularly challenging because not only is their position in space important for clinicians but it is also important to be able to resolve their spatial relationship. We applied visualization techniques that provide shape cues as well as depth cues to allow the viewer to differentiate between vessels that are closer from those that are farther. We use our computed vesselness coefficient to effectively visualize vasculature in both clinical neurovascular x-ray computed tomography based angiography images, as well as images from three different animal studies. We conducted a formal user evaluation of our visualization techniques with the help of radiologists, surgeons, and other expert users. Results indicate that experts preferred distance color blending and tone shading for conveying depth over standard visualization techniques.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658181/","LOCKED","4658181","Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Yale School of Medicine","","Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Yale School of Medicine","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37278517400","1","Alark Joshi","37278517400","Texas A and M University, USA","","Texas A and M University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085378724","2","Xiaoning Qian","37085378724","Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Yale School of Medicine","Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Yale School of Medicine","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38263277600","3","Donald Dione","38263277600","Department of Neurosurgery, Yale School of Medicine","Department of Neurosurgery, Yale School of Medicine","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087421433","4","Ketan Bulsara","37087421433","Department of Surgery, Yale School of Medicine","Department of Surgery, Yale School of Medicine","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38181319900","5","Christopher Breuer","38181319900","Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Yale School of Medicine","Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Yale School of Medicine","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267968800","6","Albert Sinusas","37267968800","Department of Diagnostic Radiology and the Department of Biomedical Engineering, Yale University, USA","Department of Diagnostic Radiology and the Department of Biomedical Engineering, Yale University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294174000","7","Xenophon Papademetris","37294174000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","29","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.123","498","1610","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658181/","Index Terms—","Vessel visualization","","","Vessel identification","Evaluation of visualization techniques","","","","","","","Data visualization","Surgery","","Biomedical imaging","Medical diagnostic imaging","Shape","X-ray imaging","Transfer functions","Radiology","Spatial resolution","Computed tomography","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658181","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","51","1603","Effective visualization of complex vascular structures using a non-parametric vessel detection method","14"
"Wikipedia is an example of the collaborative, semi-structured data sets emerging on the Web. These data sets have large, non-uniform schema that require costly data integration into structured tables before visualization can begin. We present Vispedia, a Web-based visualization system that reduces the cost of this data integration. Users can browse Wikipedia, select an interesting data table, then use a search interface to discover, integrate, and visualize additional columns of data drawn from multiple Wikipedia articles. This interaction is supported by a fast path search algorithm over DBpedia, a semantic graph extracted from Wikipedia's hyperlink structure. Vispedia can also export the augmented data tables produced for use in traditional visualization systems. We believe that these techniques begin to address the ""long tail"" of visualization by allowing a wider audience to visualize a broader class of data. We evaluated this system in a first-use formative lab study. Study participants were able to quickly create effective visualizations for a diverse set of domains, performing data integration as needed.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658132/","LOCKED","4658132","University of Stanford, USA","","University of Stanford, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37876908500","1","Bryan Chan","37876908500","University of Stanford, USA","","University of Stanford, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37877444800","2","Leslie Wu","37877444800","University of Stanford, USA","University of Stanford, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604514900","3","Justin Talbot","37604514900","University of Stanford, USA","University of Stanford, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37870000300","4","Mike Cammarano","37870000300","University of Stanford, USA","University of Stanford, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349803800","5","Pat Hanrahan","37349803800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","28","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.178","601","1220","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658132/","Index Terms—","information visualization","","","data integration","Wikipedia","semantic web","search interface","","","","","Wikipedia","Data visualization","","Costs","Collaboration","Collaborative software","Data mining","Semantic Web","Eyes","Cleaning","Iterative algorithms","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658132","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","52","1213","Vispedia: Interactive Visual Exploration of Wikipedia Data via Search-Based Integration","14"
"In this work we present basic methodology for interactive volume editing on GPUs, and we demonstrate the use of these methods to achieve a number of different effects. We present fast techniques to modify the appearance and structure of volumetric scalar fields given on Cartesian grids. Similar to 2D circular brushes as used in surface painting we present 3D spherical brushes for intuitive coloring of particular structures in such fields. This paint metaphor is extended to allow the user to change the data itself, and the use of this functionality for interactive structure isolation, hole filling, and artefact removal is demonstrated. Building on previous work in the field we introduce high-resolution selection volumes, which can be seen as a resolution-based focus+context metaphor. By utilizing such volumes we present a novel approach to interactive volume editing at sub-voxel accuracy. Finally, we introduce a fast technique to paste textures onto iso-surfaces in a 3D scalar field. Since the texture resolution is independent of the volume resolution, this technique allows structure-aligned textures containing appearance properties or textual information to be used for volume augmentation and annotation.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658154/","LOCKED","4658154","Technische Universität Műnchen","","Technische Universität Műnchen","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37587634700","1","Kai Bürger","37587634700","Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute","","Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37548560500","2","Jens Krüger","37548560500","Technische Universität Műnchen","Technische Universität Műnchen","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37444424000","3","Rüdiger Westermann","37444424000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","28","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.120","433","1395","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658154/","Index Terms—","Volume editing","","","GPU","painting","carving","annotations","","","","","Rendering (computer graphics)","Brushes","","Painting","Graphics","Data visualization","Paints","Filling","Buildings","Biomedical imaging","Engineering in medicine and biology","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658154","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","53","1388","Direct Volume Editing","14"
"The method of Moving Least Squares (MLS) is a popular framework for reconstructing continuous functions from scattered data due to its rich mathematical properties and well-understood theoretical foundations. This paper applies MLS to volume rendering, providing a unified mathematical framework for ray casting of scalar data stored over regular as well as irregular grids. We use the MLS reconstruction to render smooth isosurfaces and to compute accurate derivatives for high-quality shading effects. We also present a novel, adaptive preintegration scheme to improve the efficiency of the ray casting algorithm by reducing the overall number of function evaluations, and an efficient implementation of our framework exploiting modern graphics hardware. The resulting system enables high-quality volume integration and shaded isosurface rendering for regular and irregular volume data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658152/","LOCKED","4658152","IIC, Harvard University, USA","","IIC, Harvard University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869733800","1","Christian Ledergerber","37869733800","CNR of Pisa","","CNR of Pisa","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869737100","2","Gaël Guennebaud","37869737100","IIC, Harvard University, USA","IIC, Harvard University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564728700","3","Miriah Meyer","37564728700","IIC, Harvard University, USA","IIC, Harvard University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089884570","4","Moritz Bächer","37089884570","IIC, Harvard University, USA","IIC, Harvard University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275698100","5","Hanspeter Pfister","37275698100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","27","2","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.186","380","1379","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658152/","Index Terms—","Volume Visualization","","","Unstructured Grids","Moving Least Squares Reconstruction","Adaptive Integration","","","","","","Multilevel systems","Casting","","Image reconstruction","Isosurfaces","Rendering (computer graphics)","Least squares methods","Data visualization","Interpolation","Scattering","Graphics","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658152","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","54","1372","Volume MLS Ray Casting","14"
"Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs) support the heart in its vital task of maintaining circulation in the human body when the heart alone is not able to maintain a sufficient flow rate due to illness or degenerative diseases. However, the engineering of these devices is a highly demanding task. Advanced modeling methods and computer simulations allow the investigation of the fluid flow inside such a device and in particular of potential blood damage. In this paper we present a set of visualization methods which have been designed to specifically support the analysis of a tensor-based blood damage prediction model. This model is based on the tracing of particles through the VAD, for each of which the cumulative blood damage can be computed. The model's tensor output approximates a single blood cell's deformation in the flow field. The tensor and derived scalar data are subsequently visualized using techniques based on icons, particle visualization, and function plotting. All these techniques are accessible through a Virtual Reality-based user interface, which features not only stereoscopic rendering but also natural interaction with the complex three-dimensional data. To illustrate the effectiveness of these visualization methods, we present the results of an analysis session that was performed by domain experts for a specific data set for the MicroMed DeBakey VAD.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658170/","LOCKED","4658170","Virtual Reality Group, RWTH Aachen University, Germany","","Virtual Reality Group, RWTH Aachen University, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38319785600","1","Bernd Hentschel","38319785600","Virtual Reality Group, RWTH Aachen University, Germany","","Virtual Reality Group, RWTH Aachen University, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37870001300","2","Irene Tedjo","37870001300","Computational Analysis of Technical Systems (CATS), RWTH Aachen University, Germany","Computational Analysis of Technical Systems (CATS), RWTH Aachen University, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37867688300","3","Markus Probst","37867688300","Virtual Reality Group, RWTH Aachen University, Germany","Virtual Reality Group, RWTH Aachen University, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38352396500","4","Marc Wolter","38352396500","Computational Analysis of Technical Systems (CATS), RWTH Aachen University, Germany","Computational Analysis of Technical Systems (CATS), RWTH Aachen University, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37865964700","5","Marek Behr","37865964700","Institute for Scientific Computing, RWTH Aachen University, Germany","Institute for Scientific Computing, RWTH Aachen University, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37330529700","6","Christian Bischof","37330529700","Virtual Reality Group, RWTH Aachen University, Germany","Virtual Reality Group, RWTH Aachen University, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37391845800","7","Torsten Kuhlen","37391845800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","26","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.142","578","1522","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658170/","Index Terms—","Tensor visualization","","","time-dependent data","blood damage","ventricular assist device","virtual reality","","","","","Blood","Data visualization","","Heart","Tensile stress","Humans","Degenerative diseases","Maintenance engineering","Biological system modeling","Computer simulation","Fluid flow","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658170","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","55","1515","Interactive Blood Damage Analysis for Ventricular Assist Devices","14"
"We introduce and analyze an efficient reconstruction algorithm for FCC-sampled data. The reconstruction is based on the 6-direction box spline that is naturally associated with the FCC lattice and shares the continuity and approximation order of the triquadratic B-spline. We observe less aliasing for generic level sets and derive special techniques to attain the higher evaluation efficiency promised by the lower degree and smaller stencil-size of the $C^1$ 6-direction box spline over the triquadratic B-spline.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658171/","LOCKED","4658171","CISE Department, University of Florida, USA","","CISE Department, University of Florida, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37878688900","1","Minho Kim","37878688900","CISE Department, University of Florida, USA","","CISE Department, University of Florida, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268675600","2","Alireza Entezari","37268675600","CISE Department, University of Florida, USA","CISE Department, University of Florida, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37288759800","3","Jörg Peters","37288759800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","24","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.115","254","1530","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658171/","Index Terms—","volumetric data reconstruction","","","box spline","Face-Centered Cubic lattice","","","","","","","Spline","Lattices","","FCC","Sampling methods","Reconstruction algorithms","Signal resolution","Approximation algorithms","Filters","Algorithm design and analysis","Level set","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658171","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","56","1523","Box Spline Reconstruction On The Face-Centered Cubic Lattice","14"
"In the established procedural model of information visualization, the first operation is to transform raw data into data tables. The transforms typically include abstractions that aggregate and segment relevant data and are usually defined by a human, user or programmer. The theme of this paper is that for video, data transforms should be supported by low level computer vision. High level reasoning still resides in the human analyst, while part of the low level perception is handled by the computer. To illustrate this approach, we present Viz-A-Vis, an overhead video capture and access system for activity analysis in natural settings over variable periods of time. Overhead video provides rich opportunities for long-term behavioral and occupancy analysis, but it poses considerable challenges. We present initial steps addressing two challenges. First, overhead video generates overwhelmingly large volumes of video impractical to analyze manually. Second, automatic video analysis remains an open problem for computer vision.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658139/","LOCKED","4658139","Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","","Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37878399300","1","Mario Romero","37878399300","Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","","Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300431800","2","Jay Summet","37300431800","Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267736900","3","John Stasko","37267736900","Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37297994200","4","Gregory Abowd","37297994200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","22","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.185","599","1268","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658139/","Index Terms—","Spatiotemporal visualization","","","time series data","video visualization","sensor analytics","image/video analytics","","","","","Visualization","Computer vision","","","","","","","","","","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658139","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","57","1261","Viz-A-Vis: Toward Visualizing Video through Computer Vision","14"
"While it is quite typical to deal with attributes of different data types in the visualization of heterogeneous and multivariate datasets, most existing techniques still focus on the most usual data types such as numerical attributes or strings. In this paper we present a new approach to the interactive visual exploration and analysis of data that contains attributes which are of set type. A set-typed attribute of a data item - like one cell in a table - has a list of nGt=0 elements as its value. We present the setpsilaopsilagram as a new visualization approach to represent data of set type and to enable interactive visual exploration and analysis. We also demonstrate how this approach is capable to help in dealing with datasets that have a larger number of dimensions (more than a dozen or more), especially also in the context of categorical data. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present the interactive visual analysis of a CRM dataset with data from a questionnaire on the education and shopping habits of about 90000 people.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658148/","LOCKED","4658148","VRVis Research Center Vienna, Austria","","VRVis Research Center Vienna, Austria","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38017008700","1","Wolfgang Freiler","38017008700","VRVis Research Center Vienna, Austria","","VRVis Research Center Vienna, Austria","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37947312900","2","Kresimir Matkovic","37947312900","University of Bergen in Norway, Norway","University of Bergen in Norway, Norway","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274158800","3","Helwig Hauser","37274158800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","21","4","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.144","549","1347","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658148/","Index Terms—","Interactive Visual Analysis","","","Multidimensional Multivariate Data Visualization","Categorical Data Visualization","Interactive Visualization","Focus+Context Visualization","Multiple Coordinated Views","","","","Data analysis","Data visualization","","Computer Society","Information analysis","Multidimensional systems","Focusing","Cleaning","Tensile stress","Videos","Histograms","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658148","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","58","1340","Interactive Visual Analysis of Set-Typed Data","14"

"Neurosurgical planning and image guided neurosurgery require the visualization of multimodal data obtained from various functional and structural image modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), functional MRI, Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and so on. In the case of epilepsy neurosurgery for example, these images are used to identify brain regions to guide intracranial electrode implantation and resection. Generally, such data is visualized using 2D slices and in some cases using a 3D volume rendering along with the functional imaging results. Visualizing the activation region effectively by still preserving sufficient surrounding brain regions for context is exceedingly important to neurologists and surgeons. We present novel interaction techniques for visualization of multimodal data to facilitate improved exploration and planning for neurosurgery. We extended the line widget from VTK to allow surgeons to control the shape of the region of the brain that they can visually crop away during exploration and surgery. We allow simple spherical, cubical, ellipsoidal and cylindrical (probe aligned cuts) for exploration purposes. In addition we integrate the cropping tool with the image-guided navigation system used for epilepsy neurosurgery. We are currently investigating the use of these new tools in surgical planning and based on further feedback from our neurosurgeons we will integrate them into the setup used for image-guided neurosurgery.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658179/","LOCKED","4658179","Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Yale School of Medicine","","Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Yale School of Medicine","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37278517400","1","Alark Joshi","37278517400","Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Yale School of Medicine","","Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Yale School of Medicine","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869717400","2","Dustin Scheinost","37869717400","Department of Neurosurgery, Yale School of Medicine","Department of Neurosurgery, Yale School of Medicine","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294407100","3","Kenneth Vives","37294407100","Department of Neurosurgery, Yale School of Medicine","Department of Neurosurgery, Yale School of Medicine","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37290937600","4","Dennis Spencer","37290937600","Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Department of Biomedical Engineering and the Department of Electrical Engineering Electrical Engineering, Yale University, USA","Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Department of Biomedical Engineering and the Department of Electrical Engineering Electrical Engineering, Yale University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284143200","5","Lawrence Staib","37284143200","Department of Diagnostic Radiology and the Department of Biomedical Engineering, Yale University, USA","Department of Diagnostic Radiology and the Department of Biomedical Engineering, Yale University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294174000","6","Xenophon Papademetris","37294174000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","19","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.150","456","1594","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658179/","Index Terms—","User interaction","","","Irregular cropping","Multimodal visualization","","","","","","","Neurosurgery","Navigation","","Data visualization","Surgery","Magnetic resonance imaging","Computed tomography","Epilepsy","Shape control","Single photon emission computed tomography","Electrodes","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658179","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","60","1587","Novel interaction techniques for neurosurgical planning and stereotactic navigation","14"
"Particle deposition in the small bronchial tubes (generations six through twelve) is strongly influenced by the vortex-dominated secondary flows that are induced by axial curvature of the tubes. In this paper, we employ particle destination maps in conjunction with two-dimensional, finite-time Lyapunov exponent maps to illustrate how the trajectories of finite-mass particles are influenced by the presence of vortices. We consider two three-generation bronchial tube models: a planar, asymmetric geometry and a non-planar, asymmetric geometry. Our visualizations demonstrate that these techniques, coupled with judiciously seeded particle trajectories, are effective tools for studying particle/flow structure interactions.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658157/","LOCKED","4658157","Graduate Research Assistant at the Computational Simulation and Design Center, Mississippi State University, USA","","Graduate Research Assistant at the Computational Simulation and Design Center, Mississippi State University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37866648000","1","Bela Soni","37866648000","Department of Aerospace Engineering, Mississippi State University, USA","","Department of Aerospace Engineering, Mississippi State University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089131714","2","David Thompson","37089131714","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, USA","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37269516700","3","Raghu Machiraju","37269516700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","17","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.183","318","1427","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658157/","Index Terms—","FTLE","","","particle trajectory","visualization","bronchial tube","","","","","","Visualization","Geometry","","Lungs","Trajectory","Solid modeling","Fluid flow","Fluid dynamics","Computational modeling","Aerospace simulation","Computer simulation","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658157","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","61","1412","Visualizing Particle/Flow Structure Interactions in the Small Bronchial Tubes","14"
"The treemap is one of the most popular methods for visualizing hierarchical data. When a treemap contains a large number of items, inspecting or comparing a few selected items in a greater level of detail becomes very challenging. In this paper, we present a seamless multi-focus and context technique, called Balloon Focus, that allows the user to smoothly enlarge multiple treemap items served as the foci, while maintaining a stable treemap layout as the context. Our method has several desirable features. First, this method is quite general and can be used with different treemap layout algorithms. Second, as the foci are enlarged, the relative positions among all items are preserved. Third, the foci are placed in a way that the remaining space is evenly distributed back to the non-focus treemap items. When Balloon Focus enlarges the focus items to a maximum degree, the above features ensure that the treemap will maintain a consistent appearance and avoid any abrupt layout changes. In our algorithm, a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) is used to maintain the positional constraints, and an elastic model is employed to govern the placement of the treemap items. We demonstrate a treemap visualization system that integrates data query, manual focus selection, and our novel multi-focus+context technique, Balloon Focus, together. A user study was conducted. Results show that with Balloon Focus, users can better perform the tasks of comparing the values and the distribution of the foci.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658125/","LOCKED","4658125","Computer Science and Engineering Department, Ohio State Uinversity, USA","","Computer Science and Engineering Department, Ohio State Uinversity, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37875062100","1","Ying Tu","37875062100","Computer Science and Engineering Department, Ohio State Uinversity, USA","","Computer Science and Engineering Department, Ohio State Uinversity, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279493500","2","Han-Wei Shen","37279493500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","16","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.114","482","1164","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658125/","Index Terms—","Treemap","","","focus+context","multi-focus","fisheye","magnification","visualizing query results","multi-scale viewing.","","","Data visualization","Displays","","Tree graphs","Computer science","Manuals","Large-scale systems","File systems","Telecommunication traffic","Navigation","Computer interfaces","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658125","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","62","1157","Balloon Focus: a Seamless Multi-Focus+Context Method for Treemaps","14"
"Myocardial perfusion imaging with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is an established method for the detection and evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD). State-of-the-art SPECT scanners yield a large number of regional parameters of the left-ventricular myocardium (e.g., blood supply at rest and during stress, wall thickness, and wall thickening during heart contraction) that all need to be assessed by the physician. Today, the individual parameters of this multivariate data set are displayed as stacks of 2D slices, bull's eye plots, or, more recently, surfaces in 3D, which depict the left-ventricular wall. In all these visualizations, the data sets are displayed side-by-side rather than in an integrated manner, such that the multivariate data have to be examined sequentially and need to be fused mentally. This is time consuming and error-prone. In this paper we present an interactive 3D glyph visualization, which enables an effective integrated visualization of the multivariate data. Results from semiotic theory are used to optimize the mapping of different variables to glyph properties. This facilitates an improved perception of important information and thus an accelerated diagnosis. The 3D glyphs are linked to the established 2D views, which permit a more detailed inspection, and to relevant meta-information such as known stenoses of coronary vessels supplying the myocardial region. Our method has demonstrated its potential for clinical routine use in real application scenarios assessed by nuclear physicians.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658168/","LOCKED","4658168","Visualization and Computer Graphics Research Group (VisCG), University of Münster, Germany","","Visualization and Computer Graphics Research Group (VisCG), University of Münster, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38271045600","1","Jennis Meyer-Spradow","38271045600","Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital of Münster, Germany","","Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital of Münster, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273031400","2","Lars Stegger","37273031400","Visualization and Computer Graphics Research Group (VisCG), University of Münster, Germany","Visualization and Computer Graphics Research Group (VisCG), University of Münster, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089138838","3","Christian Döring","37089138838","Visualization and Computer Graphics Research Group (VisCG), University of Münster, Germany","Visualization and Computer Graphics Research Group (VisCG), University of Münster, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295281400","4","Timo Ropinski","37295281400","Visualization and Computer Graphics Research Group (VisCG), University of Münster, Germany","Visualization and Computer Graphics Research Group (VisCG), University of Münster, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267218300","5","Klaus Hinrichs","37267218300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.136","518","1506","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658168/","Index Terms—","Multivariate visualization","","","glyph techniques","SPECT","myocardial perfusion imaging","","","","","","Coronary arteriosclerosis","Myocardium","","Blood","Stress","Data visualization","Arteries","Heart","Single photon emission computed tomography","Positron emission tomography","Acceleration","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658168","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","63","1499","Glyph-Based SPECT Visualization for the Diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease","14"
"Visually assessing the effect of the coronary artery anatomy on the perfusion of the heart muscle in patients with coronary artery disease remains a challenging task. We explore the feasibility of visualizing this effect on perfusion using a numerical approach. We perform a computational simulation of the way blood is perfused throughout the myocardium purely based on information from a three-dimensional anatomical tomographic scan. The results are subsequently visualized using both three-dimensional visualizations and bull’s eye plots, partially inspired by approaches currently common in medical practice. Our approach results in a comprehensive visualization of the coronary anatomy that compares well to visualizations commonly used for other scanning technologies. We demonstrate techniques giving detailed insight in blood supply, coronary territories and feeding coronary arteries of a selected region. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach through visualizations that show information which commonly cannot be directly observed in scanning data, such as a separate visualization of the supply from each coronary artery. We thus show that the results of a computational simulation can be effectively visualized and facilitate visually correlating these results to for example perfusion data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658180/","LOCKED","4658180","Vienna University of Technology, Austria","","Vienna University of Technology, Austria","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869997400","1","Maurice Termeer","37869997400","Philips Healthcare","","Philips Healthcare","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086889017","2","Javier Oliván Bescós","37086889017","Philips Healthcare","Philips Healthcare","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37374875300","3","Marcel Breeuwer","37374875300","Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands","Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282551500","4","Anna Vilanova","37282551500","Philips Healthcare","Philips Healthcare","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37374887400","5","Frans Gerritsen","37374887400","Vienna University of Technology, Austria","Vienna University of Technology, Austria","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282552200","6","M.

"In this paper we introduce a technique for applying textual labels to 3D surfaces. An effective labeling must balance the conflicting goals of conveying the shape of the surface while being legible from a range of viewing directions. Shape can be conveyed by placing the text as a texture directly on the surface, providing shape cues, meaningful landmarks and minimally obstructing the rest of the model. But rendering such surface text is problematic both in regions of high curvature, where text would be warped, and in highly occluded regions, where it would be hidden. Our approach achieves both labeling goals by applying surface labels to a ’text scaffold’, a surface explicitly constructed to hold the labels. Text scaffolds conform to the underlying surface whenever possible, but can also float above problem regions, allowing them to be smooth while still conveying the overall shape. This paper provides methods for constructing scaffolds from a variety of input sources, including meshes, constructive solid geometry, and scalar fields. These sources are first mapped into a distance transform, which is then filtered and used to construct a new mesh on which labels are either manually or automatically placed. In the latter case, annotated regions of the input surface are associated with proximal regions on the new mesh, and labels placed using cartographic principles.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658190/","LOCKED","4658190","Department of Computer Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA","","Department of Computer Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37882969500","1","Gregory Cipriano","37882969500","Department of Computer Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA","","Department of Computer Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282585700","2","Michael Gleicher","37282585700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.168","257","1682","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658190/","Index Terms—","surface labeling","","","computational cartography","text authoring","annotation","","","","","","Labeling","Shape","","Rough surfaces","Surface roughness","Surface texture","Solids","Geometry","Art","Visualization","Three dimensional displays","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658190","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","65","1675","Text Scaffolds for Effective Surface Labeling","14"
"Large datasets typically contain coarse features comprised of finer sub-features. Even if the shapes of the small structures are evident in a 3D display, the aggregate shapes they suggest may not be easily inferred. From previous studies in shape perception, the evidence has not been clear whether physically-based illumination confers any advantage over local illumination for understanding scenes that arise in visualization of large data sets that contain features at two distinct scales. In this paper we show that physically-based illumination can improve the perception for some static scenes of complex 3D geometry from flow fields. We perform human-subjects experiments to quantify the effect of physically-based illumination on participant performance for two tasks: selecting the closer of two streamtubes from a field of tubes, and identifying the shape of the domain of a flow field over different densities of tubes. We find that physically-based illumination influences participant performance as strongly as perspective projection, suggesting that physically-based illumination is indeed a strong cue to the layout of complex scenes. We also find that increasing the density of tubes for the shape identification task improved participant performance under physically-based illumination but not under the traditional hardware-accelerated illumination model.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658196/","LOCKED","4658196","UT/ORNL Joint Institiute for Computational Sciences, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, USA","","UT/ORNL Joint Institiute for Computational Sciences, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282585600","1","Chris Weigle","37282585600","UT/ORNL Joint Institiute for Computational Sciences, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, USA","","UT/ORNL Joint Institiute for Computational Sciences, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37356983700","2","David Banks","37356983700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.108","337","1730","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658196/","Index Terms—","user study","DT-MRI","white matter tractography","volume completion","3D shape perception","physically-based illumination","global illumination","local illumination","multi-scale visualization","flow visualization","streamtubes","Lighting","Three dimensional displays","","Shape","Layout","Data visualization","Humans","Visual system","Psychology","Aggregates","Geometry","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658196","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","66","1723","A Comparison of the Perceptual Benefits of Linear Perspective and Physically-Based Illumination for Display of Dense 3D Streamtubes","14"
"Understanding the structure of microvasculature structures and their relationship to cells in biological tissue is an important and complex problem. Brain microvasculature in particular is known to play an important role in chronic diseases. However, these networks are only visible at the microscopic level and can span large volumes of tissue. Due to recent advances in microscopy, large volumes of data can be imaged at the resolution necessary to reconstruct these structures. Due to the dense and complex nature of microscopy data sets, it is important to limit the amount of information displayed. In this paper, we describe methods for encoding the unique structure of microvascular data, allowing researchers to selectively explore microvascular anatomy. We also identify the queries most useful to researchers studying microvascular and cellular relationships. By associating cellular structures with our microvascular framework, we allow researchers to explore interesting anatomical relationships in dense and complex data sets.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658182/","LOCKED","4658182","Department of Computer Science, Texas A and M University, USA","","Department of Computer Science, Texas A and M University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282589200","1","David Mayerich","37282589200","Department of Veterinary Integrative Biosciences, Texas A and M University, USA","","Department of Veterinary Integrative Biosciences, Texas A and M University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37884259000","2","Louise Abbott","37884259000","Department of Computer Science, Texas A and M University, USA","Department of Computer Science, Texas A and M University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282588300","3","John Keyser","37282588300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","14","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.179","344","1618","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658182/","Index Terms—","vascular","","","microscopy","fibers","cells","complex data","","","","","Data visualization","Microscopy","","Cells (biology)","Biomedical imaging","Magnetic resonance imaging","Arteries","Veins","Image resolution","Blood vessels","Computed tomography","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658182","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","67","1611","Visualization of Cellular and Microvascular Relationships","14"
"Surveys and opinion polls are extremely popular in the media, especially in the months preceding a general election. However, the available tools for analyzing poll results often require specialized training. Hence, data analysis remains out of reach for many casual computer users. Moreover, the visualizations used to communicate the results of surveys are typically limited to traditional statistical graphics like bar graphs and pie charts, both of which are fundamentally noninteractive. We present a simple interactive visualization that allows users to construct queries on large tabular data sets, and view the results in real time. The results of two separate user studies suggest that our interface lowers the learning curve for naive users, while still providing enough analytical power to discover interesting correlations in the data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658130/","LOCKED","4658130","School of Computing, University of Utah, USA","","School of Computing, University of Utah, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869715500","1","Geoffrey Draper","37869715500","School of Computing, University of Utah, USA","","School of Computing, University of Utah, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37448812400","2","Richard Riesenfeld","37448812400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.187","376","1204","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658130/","Index Terms—","Visual query languages","","","radial visualization","data analysis","human-computer interaction","","","","","","Voting","Database languages","","Data visualization","Data analysis","Nominations and elections","Demography","Computer graphics","","","","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658130","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","68","1197","Who Votes For What?

"Many interesting and promising prototypes for visualizing video data have been proposed, including those that combine videos with their spatial context (contextualized videos). However, relatively little work has investigated the fundamental design factors behind these prototypes in order to provide general design guidance. Focusing on real-time video data visualization, we evaluated two important design factors - video placement method and spatial context presentation method - through a user study. In addition, we evaluated the effect of spatial knowledge of the environment. Participantspsila performance was measured through path reconstruction tasks, where the participants followed a target through simulated surveillance videos and marked the target paths on the environment model. We found that embedding videos inside the model enabled realtime strategies and led to faster performance. With the help of contextualized videos, participants not familiar with the real environment achieved similar task performance to participants that worked in that environment. We discuss design implications and provide general design recommendations for traffic and security surveillance system interfaces.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658200/","LOCKED","4658200","Virginia Tech","","Virginia Tech","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601156200","1","Yi Wang","37601156200","Virginia Tech","","Virginia Tech","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282977600","2","Doug Bowman","37282977600","Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center","Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center","Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37391946800","3","David Krum","37391946800","Bosch RTC","Bosch RTC","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088672734","4","Enylton Coalho","37088672734","Virginia Tech","Virginia Tech","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38270396300","5","Tonya Smith-Jackson","38270396300","Virginia Tech","Virginia Tech","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088672911","6","David Bailey","37088672911","Virginia Tech","Virginia Tech","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37876923500","7","Sarah Peck","37876923500","Virginia Tech","Virginia Tech","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088673213","8","Swethan Anand","37088673213","Virginia Tech","Virginia Tech","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088672752","9","Trevor Kennedy","37088672752","Virginia Tech","Virginia Tech","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088674042","10","Yernar Abdrazakov","37088674042","12","1","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.126","320","1762","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658200/","Index Terms—","contextualized videos","","","design factors","user study","video placement","spatial context","tracking","path reconstruction","","","Humans","Video surveillance","","Prototypes","Data visualization","Decision making","Information analysis","Guidelines","Particle measurements","Traffic control","Information security","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658200","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","69","1755","Effects of Video Placement and Spatial Context Presentation on Path Reconstruction Tasks with Contextualized Videos","14"
"With recent advances in the measurement technology for allsky astrophysical imaging, our view of the sky is no longer limited to the tiny visible spectral range over the 2D Celestial sphere. We now can access a third dimension corresponding to a broad electromagnetic spectrum with a wide range of allsky surveys; these surveys span frequency bands including long long wavelength radio, microwaves, very short X-rays, and gamma rays. These advances motivate us to study and examine multiwavelength visualization techniques to maximize our capabilities to visualize and exploit these informative image data sets. In this work, we begin with the processing of the data themselves, uniformizing the representations and units of raw data obtained from varied detector sources. Then we apply tools to map, convert, color-code, and format the multiwavelength data in forms useful for applications. We explore different visual representations for displaying the data, including such methods as textured image stacks, the horseshoe representation, and GPU-based volume visualization. A family of visual tools and analysis methods are introduced to explore the data, including interactive data mapping on the graphics processing unit (GPU), the mini-map explorer, and GPU-based interactive feature analysis.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658175/","LOCKED","4658175","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37881121400","1","Hongwei Li","37881121400","Nanyang Technological University, Singapore","","Nanyang Technological University, Singapore","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37336329800","2","Chi-Wing Fu","37336329800","Indiana University, Bloomington, USA","Indiana University, Bloomington, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37333439100","3","Andrew Hanson","37333439100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","11","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.182","482","1562","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658175/","Index Terms—","Astrophysical visualization","","","multiwavelength data","astronomy","","","","","","","Data visualization","Extraterrestrial measurements","","Electromagnetic measurements","Optical imaging","Electromagnetic spectrum","Frequency","X-rays","Gamma rays","Detectors","Image converters","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658175","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","70","1555","Visualizing Multiwavelength Astrophysical Data","14"
"Smooth surface extraction using PDEs is a well-known and widely used technique for visualizing volume data. Existing approaches operate on gridded data and mainly on regular structured grids. When considering unstructured point-based volume data where sample points do not form regular patterns nor are they connected in any form, one would typically resample the data over a grid prior to applying the known PDE-based methods. As resampling inserts interpolation inaccuracies, data providers would rather have segmentation methods operate on the actual unstructured data. We propose an approach that directly extracts smooth surfaces from unstructured point-based volume data without prior resampling or mesh generation.When operating on unstructured data one needs to quickly derive neighborhood informations. The respective information is retrieved by partitioning the 3D domain into cells using a kd-tree and operating on its cells. We exploit neighborhood information to estimate gradients and mean curvature at every sample point using a four-dimensional least-squares fitting approach. Gradients and mean curvature are required for applying the chosen PDE-based method that combines hyperbolic advection to an isovalue of a given scalar field and mean curvature flow. Since we are using an explicit time-integration scheme, time steps are bounded by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition. To avoid small global time steps, we use asynchronous local integration. We extract the surface by successively fitting a smooth function to the data set. This function is initialized with a signed distance function. For each sample and for every time step we compute the respective gradient, the mean curvature, and a stable time step. With these informations the function is manipulated using an explicit Euler time integration. The process continues with the next sample point in time. If the norm of the function gradient in a sample exceeds a given threshold at some time the function is reinitializ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658172/","LOCKED","4658172","Jacobs University Bremen, Bremen, Germany","","Jacobs University Bremen, Bremen, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37643113600","1","Paul Rosenthal","37643113600","Jacobs University Bremen, Bremen, Germany","","Jacobs University Bremen, Bremen, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266826500","2","Lars Linsen","37266826500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","11","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.164","425","1546","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658172/","Index Terms—","PDEs","","","surface extraction","level sets","point-based visualization","","","","","","Data mining","Data visualization","","Partial differential equations","Convergence","Surface fitting","Isosurfaces","Sensor systems","Jacobian matrices","Mesh generation","Information retrieval","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658172","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","71","1531","Smooth Surface Extraction from Unstructured Point-based Volume Data Using PDEs","14"
"Marching cubes is the most popular isosurface extraction algorithm due to its simplicity, efficiency and robustness. It has been widely studied, improved, and extended. While much early work was concerned with efficiency and correctness issues, lately there has been a push to improve the quality of marching cubes meshes so that they can be used in computational codes. In this work we present a new classification of MC cases that we call edge groups, which helps elucidate the issues that impact the triangle quality of the meshes that the method generates. This formulation allows a more systematic way to bound the triangle quality, and is general enough to extend to other polyhedral cell shapes used in other polygonization algorithms. Using this analysis, we also discuss ways to improve the quality of the resulting triangle mesh, including some that require only minor modifications of the original algorithm.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658187/","LOCKED","4658187","Instituto de Informática, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil","","Instituto de Informática, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37867422200","1","carlos dietrich","37867422200","Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA","","Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550809300","2","Carlos Scheidegger","37550809300","Instituto de Informática, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil","Instituto de Informática, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267034700","3","João Comba","37267034700","Instituto de Informática, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil","Instituto de Informática, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37329407400","4","Luciana Nedel","37329407400","Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA","Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275249200","5","Cláudio Silva","37275249200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.122","307","1666","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658187/","Index Terms—","Isosurface extraction","","","Marching Cubes","","","","","","","","Isosurfaces","Robustness","","Mesh generation","Shape","Algorithm design and analysis","Proposals","Mathematics","Computational modeling","Pressing","Scientific computing","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658187","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","72","1651","Edge Groups: An Approach to Understanding the Mesh Quality of Marching Methods","14"
"Volume exploration is an important issue in scientific visualization. Research on volume exploration has been focused on revealing hidden structures in volumetric data. While the information of individual structures or features is useful in practice, spatial relations between structures are also important in many applications and can provide further insights into the data. In this paper, we systematically study the extraction, representation,exploration, and visualization of spatial relations in volumetric data and propose a novel relation-aware visualization pipeline for volume exploration. In our pipeline, various relations in the volume are first defined and measured using region connection calculus (RCC) and then represented using a graph interface called relation graph. With RCC and the relation graph, relation query and interactive exploration can be conducted in a comprehensive and intuitive way. The visualization process is further assisted with relation-revealing viewpoint selection and color and opacity enhancement. We also introduce a quality assessment scheme which evaluates the perception of spatial relations in the rendered images. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the practical use of our system in exploratory visualization.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658191/","LOCKED","4658191","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China","","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37401176900","1","Ming-Yuen Chan","37401176900","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China","","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","2","Huamin Qu","37272637300","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406959900","3","Ka-Kei Chung","37406959900","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37306814700","4","Wai-Ho Mak","37306814700","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","5","Yingcai Wu","37407308300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.159","240","1690","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658191/","Index Terms—","Exploratory Visualization","","","Relation-Based Visualization","Visualization Pipeline.","","","","","","","Pipelines","Rendering (computer graphics)","","Data visualization","Data mining","Volume measurement","Calculus","Color","Quality assessment","Data acquisition","Analytical models","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658191","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","73","1683","Relation-Aware Volume Exploration Pipeline","14"
"In this work we develop a new alternative to conventional maps for visualization of relatively short paths as they are frequently encountered in hotels, resorts or museums. Our approach is based on a warped rendering of a 3D model of the environment such that the visualized path appears to be straight even though it may contain several junctions. This has the advantage that the beholder of the image gains a realistic impression of the surroundings along the way which makes it easy to retrace the route in practice. We give an intuitive method for generation of such images and present results from user studies undertaken to evaluate the benefit of the warped images for orientation in unknown environments.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658162/","LOCKED","4658162","Computer Graphics Group, University of Bonn, Germany","","Computer Graphics Group, University of Bonn, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37870005900","1","Patrick Degener","37870005900","Computer Graphics Group, University of Bonn, Germany","","Computer Graphics Group, University of Bonn, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37867979100","2","Ruwen Schnabel","37867979100","Computer Graphics Group, University of Bonn, Germany","Computer Graphics Group, University of Bonn, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37719871100","3","Christopher Schwartz","37719871100","Computer Graphics Group, University of Bonn, Germany","Computer Graphics Group, University of Bonn, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271619700","4","Reinhard Klein","37271619700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.124","302","1458","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658162/","Index Terms—","Maps","","","Route visualization","Space deformation","","","","","","","Visualization","Navigation","","Rendering (computer graphics)","Image generation","Humans","Layout","Shape","Psychology","Computer graphics","","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658162","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","74","1452","Effective Visualization of Short Routes","14"
"Visualization of general relativity illustrates aspects of Einstein's insights into the curved nature of space and time to the expert as well as the layperson. One of the most interesting models which came up with Einstein's theory was developed by Kurt Godel in 1949. The Godel universe is a valid solution of Einstein's field equations, making it a possible physical description of our universe. It offers remarkable features like the existence of an optical horizon beyond which time travel is possible. Although we know that our universe is not a Godel universe, it is interesting to visualize physical aspects of a world model resulting from a theory which is highly confirmed in scientific history. Standard techniques to adopt an egocentric point of view in a relativistic world model have shortcomings with respect to the time needed to render an image as well as difficulties in applying a direct illumination model. In this paper we want to face both issues to reduce the gap between common visualization standards and relativistic visualization. We will introduce two techniques to speed up recalculation of images by means of preprocessing and lookup tables and to increase image quality through a special optimization applicable to the Godel universe. The first technique allows the physicist to understand the different effects of general relativity faster and better by generating images from existing datasets interactively. By using the intrinsic symmetries of Godel's spacetime which are expressed by the Killing vector field, we are able to reduce the necessary calculations to simple cases using the second technique. This even makes it feasible to account for a direct illumination model during the rendering process. Although the presented methods are applied to Godel's universe, they can also be extended to other manifolds, for example light propagation in moving dielectric media. Therefore, other areas of research can benefit from these generic improvements.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658176/","LOCKED","4658176","Institute for Theoretical Physics and VISUS (Visualization Research Center), University of Stuttgart, Germany","","Institute for Theoretical Physics and VISUS (Visualization Research Center), University of Stuttgart, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37565762400","1","Frank Grave","37565762400","Institute of Quantum Physics, Ulm University, Germany","","Institute of Quantum Physics, Ulm University, Germany","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869988300","2","Michael Buser","37869988300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8","0","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.177","389","1570","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658176/","Index Terms—","General relativity","","","Gödel universe","nonlinear ray tracing","time travel.","","","","","","Visualization","Rendering (computer graphics)","","Lighting","Equations","History","Table lookup","Image quality","Image generation","Optical propagation","Dielectrics","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658176","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","75","1563","Visiting the Gödel Universe","14"
"A stand-alone visualization application has been developed by a multi-disciplinary, collaborative team with the sole purpose of creating an interactive exploration environment allowing turbulent flow researchers to experiment and validate hypotheses using visualization. This system has specific optimizations made in data management, caching computations, and visualization allowing for the interactive exploration of datasets on the order of 1TB in size. Using this application, the user (co-author Calo) is able to interactively visualize and analyze all regions of a transitional flow volume, including the laminar, transitional and fully turbulent regions. The underlying goal of the visualizations produced from these transitional flow simulations is to localize turbulent spots in the laminar region of the boundary layer, determine under which conditions they form, and follow their evolution. The initiation of turbulent spots, which ultimately lead to full turbulence, was located via a proposed feature detection condition and verified by experimental results. The conditions under which these turbulent spots form and coalesce are validated and presented.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658158/","LOCKED","4658158","Texas Advanced Computing Center, The University of Texas, Austin","","Texas Advanced Computing Center, The University of Texas, Austin","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37269399700","1","Gregory P.

"Data transformation, the process of preparing raw data for effective visualization, is one of the key challenges in information visualization. Although researchers have developed many data transformation techniques, there is little empirical study of the general impact of data transformation on visualization. Without such study, it is difficult to systematically decide when and which data transformation techniques are needed. We thus have designed and conducted a two-part empirical study that examines how the use of common data transformation techniques impacts visualization quality, which in turn affects user task performance. Our first experiment studies the impact of data transformation on user performance in single-step, typical visual analytic tasks. The second experiment assesses the impact of data transformation in multi-step analytic tasks. Our results quantify the benefits of data transformation in both experiments. More importantly, our analyses reveal that (1) the benefits of data transformation vary significantly by task and by visualization, and (2) the use of data transformation depends on a user's interaction context. Based on our findings, we present a set of design recommendations that help guide the development and use of data transformation techniques.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658144/","LOCKED","4658144","IBM Thomas J.

"In this paper we present an algorithm that operates on a triangular mesh and classifies each face of a triangle as either inside or outside. We present three example applications of this core algorithm: normal orientation, inside removal, and layer-based visualization. The distinguishing feature of our algorithm is its robustness even if a difficult input model that includes holes, coplanar triangles, intersecting triangles, and lost connectivity is given. Our algorithm works with the original triangles of the input model and uses sampling to construct a visibility graph that is then segmented using graph cut.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658189/","LOCKED","4658189","NVIDIA","","NVIDIA","Arizona State University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37873595500","1","Kaichi Zhou","37873595500","Oregon State University, USA","","Oregon State University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37398562200","2","Eugene Zhang","37398562200","Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic","Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085784832","3","Jiˇr´ı Bittner","37085784832","Arizona State University, USA","Arizona State University, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38514733100","4","Peter Wonka","38514733100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5","7","Journals","10.1109/TVCG.2008.176","293","1674","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658189/","Index Terms—","Interior/Exterior Classification","","","Normal Orientation","Layer Classification","Inside Removal","Graph Cut","","","","","Visualization","Electronic mail","","Face detection","Robustness","Sampling methods","Solid modeling","Geometry","Iterative algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Surface cracks","20081024","4658121","2160-9306","6","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4658189","Nov.-Dec. 2008","2945","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","2008","IEEE","78","1667","Visibility-driven Mesh Analysis and Visualization through Graph Cuts","14"
