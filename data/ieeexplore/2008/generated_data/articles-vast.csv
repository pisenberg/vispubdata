"Visual analytics experts realize that one effective way to push the field forward and to develop metrics for measuring the performance of various visual analytics components is to hold an annual competition. The VAST 2008 Challenge is the third year that such a competition was held in conjunction with the IEEE Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST) symposium. The authors restructured the contest format used in 2006 and 2007 to reduce the barriers to participation and offered four mini-challenges and a Grand Challenge. Mini Challenge participants were to use visual analytic tools to explore one of four heterogeneous data collections to analyze specific activities of a fictitious, controversial movement. Questions asked in the Grand Challenge required the participants to synthesize data from all four data sets. In this paper we give a brief overview of the data sets, the tasks, the participation, the judging, and the results.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677383/","LOCKED","4677383","University of Massachusetts, Lowell, USA","University of Massachusetts, Lowell, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37360588500","1","Georges Grinstein","37360588500","University of Maryland, USA","University of Maryland, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283026800","2","Catherine Plaisant","37283026800","National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA","National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37837224000","3","Sharon Laskowski","37837224000","National Institute of Standards and Technology","National Institute of Standards and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37948663500","4","Theresa O'Connell","37948663500","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268671300","5","Jean Scholtz","37268671300","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37357067600","6","Mark Whiting","37357067600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","27","1","19-24 Oct. 2008","Columbus, OH, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2008.4677383","366","196","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677383/","visual analytics","human information interaction","","","","","","","sense making","evaluation","metrics","contest","H.5.2 [Information Interfaces & Presentations]: User Interfaces — Evaluation/methodology","","","","Visual analytics","Feedback","Cellular phones","Performance analysis","Visualization","NIST","Data analysis","","","","20081118","4677336","978-1-4244-2935-6","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-2935-6","08EX2585","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677383","19-24 Oct. 2008","4669530","2008 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2008","IEEE","1","195","VAST 2008 Challenge: Introducing mini-challenges"
"Internet has become one of the best communication and marketing tools. Hence, designing well-structured Web sites with the information or products that users look for is a crucial mission. For this reason, understanding Web data is a decisive task to assure the success of a Website. In that sense, data mining techniques provide many metrics and statistics useful to automatically discover the structure, contents and usage of a site. This research aims at proving the usefulness of a set of information visualisation techniques in order to analyse Web data, using a visual Web mining tool that allows the combination, coordination and exploration of visualisations to get insight on Web data. The tool, named WET, provides a set of visual metaphors that represent the structure of the Websites where Web metrics are overlaid.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677377/","LOCKED","4677377","Web Research Group, Universitat Pompeu Fabra and Fundació Barcelona Media, Spain","Web Research Group, Universitat Pompeu Fabra and Fundació Barcelona Media, Spain","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38275017300","1","Victor Pascual-Cid","38275017300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","9","12","19-24 Oct. 2008","Columbus, OH, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2008.4677377","396","184","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677377/","H.4.3 [Information Systems Applications]: Communications Applications—Information browsers","H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and Presentation(I.7)]: User Interfaces—Graphical user interfaces (GUI), Interaction styles","","","","","","","H.5.4 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: Hypertext/Hypermedia—Navigation, User issues","","","","","","","","Data visualization","Information analysis","Web mining","Data mining","Internet","Web page design","Data analysis","Service oriented architecture","Information retrieval","Logic","20081118","4677336","978-1-4244-2935-6","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-2935-6","08EX2585","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677377","19-24 Oct. 2008","4669530","2008 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2008","IEEE","2","183","An information visualisation system for the understanding of web data"

"While exploring data using information visualization, analysts try to make sense of the data, build cases, and present them to others. However, if the exploration is long or done in multiple sessions, it can be hard for analysts to remember all interesting visualizations and the relationships among them they have seen. Often, they will see the same or similar visualizations, and are unable to recall when, why and how they have seen something similar. Recalling and retrieving interesting visualizations are important tasks for the analysis processes such as problem solving, reasoning, and conceptualization. In this paper, we argue that offering support for thinking based on past analysis processes is important, and present a solution for this.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677378/","LOCKED","4677378","Eindhovan University of Technology, Netherlands","Eindhovan University of Technology, Netherlands","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681468200","1","Yedendra B.

Semantic filtering is obtained via an ontology graph, based on another visual analytics tool, called OntoVis. In this summary, we describe how these tools where used to analyze one of the mini-challenges of the 2008 VAST challenge.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677391/","LOCKED","4677391","Visualization and Interface Design Innovation (VIDI) Group, University of California, Davis, USA","Visualization and Interface Design Innovation (VIDI) Group, University of California, Davis, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282925900","1","Carlos D.

"From instant messaging and email to wikis and blogs, millions of individuals are generating content that reflects their relationships with others in the world, both online and offline. Since communication artifacts are recordings of life events, we can gain insights into the social attributes and structures of the people within this communication history. In this paper, we describe SocialRank, an ego- and time-centric workflow for identifying social relationships in an email corpus. This workflow includes four high-level tasks: discovery, validation, annotation and dissemination. SocialRank combines relationship ranking algorithms with timeline, social network diagram, and multidimensional scaling visualization techniques to support these tasks.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677375/","LOCKED","4677375","Milton Eisenhower Research Center,Applied Physics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University, USA","Milton Eisenhower Research Center,Applied Physics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295585500","1","Jaime Montemayor","37295585500","Milton Eisenhower Research Center,Applied Physics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University, USA","Milton Eisenhower Research Center,Applied Physics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37331563200","2","Chris Diehl","37331563200","Milton Eisenhower Research Center,Applied Physics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University, USA","Milton Eisenhower Research Center,Applied Physics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38497064700","3","Mike Pekala","38497064700","Milton Eisenhower Research Center,Applied Physics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University, USA","Milton Eisenhower Research Center,Applied Physics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37871719400","4","David Patrone","37871719400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2","0","19-24 Oct. 2008","Columbus, OH, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2008.4677375","109","180","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677375/","H.5.2 [Information Systems]: Information Interfaces and Presentation—User interfaces","H.4.3 [Information Systems]: Communications Applications—Information browsers","","","","","","","I.3.6 [Computing Methodologies]: Methodology and Techniques—Interaction techniques","","","","","","","","Social network services","Electronic mail","Blogs","Information systems","Algorithm design and analysis","Physics","Laboratories","History","Multidimensional systems","Data visualization","20081118","4677336","978-1-4244-2935-6","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-2935-6","08EX2585","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677375","19-24 Oct. 2008","4669530","2008 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2008","IEEE","14","179","Interactive poster - SocialRank: An ego- and time-centric workflow for relationship identification"

"The adoption of visual analytics methodologies in security applications is an approach that could lead to interesting results. Usually, the data that has to be analyzed finds in a graphical representation its preferred nature, such as spatial or temporal relationships. Due to the nature of these applications, it is very important that key-details are made easy to identify. In the context of the VAST 2008 Challenge, we developed a visualization tool that graphically displays the movement of 82 employees of the Miami Department of Health (USA). We also asked 13 users to identify potential suspects and observe what happened during an evacuation of the building caused by an explosion. In this paper we explain the results of the user testing we conducted and how the users interpreted the event taken into account.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677390/","LOCKED","4677390","University of Bari, Bari, Italy","University of Bari, Bari, Italy","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37605768200","1","Adalberto L.

"Climate Change has emerged as one of the grand global challenges facing humanity. The dominant anthropogenic greenhouse gas that seems to be contributing to the climate change problem, carbon dioxide (CO2), has a complex cycle through the atmosphere, oceans and biosphere. The combustion of fossil fuels (power production, transportation, etc.) remains the largest source of anthropogenic CO2 to the Earth’s atmosphere. Up until very recently, the quantification of fossil fuel CO2 was understood only at coarse space and time scales. A recent research effort has greatly improved this space/time quantification resulting in source data at a resolution of less than 10 km2/hr at the surface of North America. By providing visual tools to examine this new, high resolution CO2 data, we can better understand the way that CO2 is transmitted within the atmosphere and how it is exchanged with other components of the Earth System. We have developed interactive visual analytic tools, which allows for easy data manipulation, analysis, and extraction. The visualization system is aimed for a wide range of users which include researchers and political leaders. The goal is to help assist these people in analyzing data and enabling new policy options in mitigation of fossil fuel CO2 emissions in the U.S.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677372/","LOCKED","4677372","Department of Computer Science, Purdue University, USA","Department of Computer Science, Purdue University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37660812000","1","Nathan Andrysco","37660812000","Department of Computer Graphics Technolog, Purdue University, USA","Department of Computer Graphics Technolog, Purdue University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37658673700","2","Bedrich Benes","37658673700","Department of Atmospheric Sciences, Purdue University, USA","Department of Atmospheric Sciences, Purdue University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38181840300","3","Kevin Gurney","38181840300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","19-24 Oct. 2008","Columbus, OH, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2008.4677372","215","174","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677372/","Visual Analytics","CO2","","","","","","","Multivariate and Spatio-Temporal Data","Volume Visualization","GIS","Interactive Visualization","I.3.8 [Computer Graphics]: Applications—","","","","Visual analytics","Atmosphere","Fossil fuels","Data analysis","Global warming","Carbon dioxide","Oceans","Biosphere","Combustion","Production","20081118","4677336","978-1-4244-2935-6","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-2935-6","08EX2585","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677372","19-24 Oct. 2008","4669530","2008 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2008","IEEE","20","173","Interactive poster: Visual analytic techniques for CO2 emissions and concentrations in the United States"
"Many real-world visual analytics applications involve time-oriented data. I am working in a research project related to this challenge where I am responsible for the interactive visualization part. My goal are interactive visualizations to explore such time-oriented data according to the user tasks while considering the structure of time. Time is composed of many granularities that are likely to have crucial influence on the formation of the data. The challenge is to integrate the granularities into a detailed compound view on the data, like the compound eye of insects integrates many images into one view. Other members of our team are experts in temporal data mining and user centered design. The goal is to combine our research topics to an integrated system that helps domain experts to get more insight from their time-oriented data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677374/","LOCKED","4677374","Department of Information and Knowledge Engineering (ike), Danube-University of Krems, Krems, Austria","Department of Information and Knowledge Engineering (ike), Danube-University of Krems, Krems, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37646290500","1","Tim Lammarsch","37646290500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","19-24 Oct. 2008","Columbus, OH, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2008.4677374","207","178","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677374/","I.3.6 [Computing Methodologies]: Computer Graphics—Methodology and Techniques","H.5.m [Information Systems]: Information Interfaces And Presentation (e.g., HCI)—Miscellaneous","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Data visualization","Visual analytics","Data mining","Computer interfaces","Calendars","Knowledge engineering","User centered design","Information systems","Business","","20081118","4677336","978-1-4244-2935-6","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-2935-6","08EX2585","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677374","19-24 Oct. 2008","4669530","2008 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2008","IEEE","21","177","A compound approach for interactive visualization of time-oriented data"
"Mutual funds are one of the most important investment instruments available. However, choosing among mutual funds is not an easy task because they vary in many different dimensions, such as asset size, turnover and fee structure, and these characteristics may affect fund returns. It is thus important to understand the relation between fund performance and these properties. In this work, we use a new visual analytical tool, the density-based distribution map, to assist in this task.

"The SPADAC team used various visual analytics tools and methods to find geo-temporal patterns of migration from a Caribbean island from 2005-2007. In this paper, we describe the tools and methods used in the analysis. These methods included generating temporal variograms, dendrograms, and proportionally weighted migration maps, using tools such as the R statistical software package and Signature Analysttrade.

"Seismic simulations use finite element methods to describe ground motion. The results of such numerical simulations are often difficult to interpret for decision makers. We describe a terrain rendering engine that uses photorealistic metaphors to represent typical terrain properties without representing an actual terrain. In the context of ground motion, a simulation of the effects of various types of earthquakes on buildings has been conducted. Usually, such structural response simulations are carried out independently and are being visualized separate from the ground motion simulation. We combine the results from both simulations in an interactive, hybrid visualization so that decision makers (first responders and emergency management agencies) are provided with a photo-realistic, simulated view of various earthquake scenarios, enabling them to study the effect of various earthquakes on buildings typical for a rural or urban area. We present a method for visually analyzing large-scale simulation data from different sources (ground motion simulation and structural response simulation) using photorealistic metaphors. We have implemented an intuitive, interactive system for visual analysis and inspection of possible effects of various types of earthquakes on an inventory of buildings typical for a particular area. The underlying rendering system can be easily adapted for other simulations, such as smoke plumes or biohazards.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677381/","LOCKED","4677381","Technical University of Kaiserslautern, Germany","Technical University of Kaiserslautern, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37645639800","1","Florian Juergen Gerhardt","37645639800","Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, University of California, Irvine, USA","Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, University of California, Irvine, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089084482","2","Joerg Meyer","37089084482","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","19-24 Oct. 2008","Columbus, OH, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2008.4677381","132","192","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677381/","I.3.3 [Computing Methodologies]: Computer Graphics—Picture/Image Generation","I.3.7 [Computing Methodologies]: Computer Graphics—Three-Dimensional Graphics and Realism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Analytical models","Earthquakes","Buildings","Finite element methods","Numerical simulation","Engines","Context modeling","Data visualization","Disaster management","Urban areas","20081118","4677336","978-1-4244-2935-6","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-2935-6","08EX2585","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677381","19-24 Oct. 2008","4669530","2008 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2008","IEEE","24","191","Visual analysis of seismic simulation data"

"Data about movements of various objects are collected in growing amounts by means of current tracking technologies. Traditional approaches to visualization and interactive exploration of movement data cannot cope with data of such sizes. In this research paper we investigate the ways of using aggregation for visual analysis of movement data. We define aggregation methods suitable for movement data and find visualization and interaction techniques to represent results of aggregations and enable comprehensive exploration of the data. We consider two possible views of movement, traffic-oriented and trajectory-oriented. Each view requires different methods of analysis and of data aggregation. We illustrate our argument with example data resulting from tracking multiple cars in Milan and example analysis tasks from the domain of city traffic management.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677356/","LOCKED","4677356","Fraunhofer Institute of Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS), Sankt-Augustin, Germany","Fraunhofer Institute of Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS), Sankt-Augustin, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047100","1","Gennady Andrienko","37283047100","Fraunhofer Institute of Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS), Sankt-Augustin, Germany","Fraunhofer Institute of Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS), Sankt-Augustin, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047700","2","Natalia Andrienko","37283047700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","148","3","19-24 Oct. 2008","Columbus, OH, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2008.4677356","1995","58","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677356/","Movement data","spatio-temporal data","","","","","","","aggregation","scalable visualization","geovisualization","","","","","","Data visualization","Data analysis","Information analysis","Cities and towns","Humans","Filtering","Information systems","Tracking","Chromium","Information processing","20081118","4677336","978-1-4244-2935-6","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-2935-6","08EX2585","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677356","19-24 Oct. 2008","4669530","2008 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2008","IEEE","26","51","Spatio-temporal aggregation for visual analysis of movements"
"As the information being visualized and the process of understanding that information both become increasingly complex, it is necessary to develop new visualization approaches that facilitate the flow of human reasoning. In this paper, we endeavor to push visualization design a step beyond current user models by discussing a modeling framework of human ldquohigher cognition.rdquo Based on this cognition model, we present design guidelines for the development of visual interfaces designed to maximize the complementary cognitive strengths of both human and computer. Some of these principles are already being reflected in the better visual analytics designs, while others have not yet been applied or fully applied. But none of the guidelines have explained the deeper rationale that the model provides. Lastly, we discuss and assess these visual analytics guidelines through the evaluation of several visualization examples.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677361/","LOCKED","4677361","Cahrlotten Visualization Center, North Carolina State University, Charlotte, USA","Cahrlotten Visualization Center, North Carolina State University, Charlotte, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403562900","1","Tera Marie Green","37403562900","Cahrlotten Visualization Center, North Carolina State University, Charlotte, USA","Cahrlotten Visualization Center, North Carolina State University, Charlotte, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300425000","2","William Ribarsky","37300425000","School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University, Canada","School of Interactive Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University, Canada","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267458000","3","Brian Fisher","37267458000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","54","0","19-24 Oct. 2008","Columbus, OH, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2008.4677361","1233","98","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677361/","visual analytics","cognition and perception theory","","","","","","","embodied cognition","visualization taxonomies and models","visual analytics","cognition and perception theory","embodied cognition","visualization taxonomies and models","","","Visual analytics","Humans","Cognition","Visualization","Guidelines","Taxonomy","Collaboration","Art","Computer interfaces","Problem-solving","20081118","4677336","978-1-4244-2935-6","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-2935-6","08EX2585","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677361","19-24 Oct. 2008","4669530","2008 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2008","IEEE","27","91","Visual analytics for complex concepts using a human cognition model"
"Visual analytic tools allow analysts to generate large collections of useful analytical results. We anticipate that analysts in most real world situations will draw from these collections when working together to solve complicated problems. This indicates a need to understand how users synthesize multiple collections of results. This paper reports the results of collaborative synthesis experiments conducted with expert geographers and disease biologists. Ten participants were worked in pairs to complete a simulated real-world synthesis task using artifacts printed on cards on a large, paper-covered workspace. Experiment results indicate that groups use a number of different approaches to collaborative synthesis, and that they employ a variety of organizational metaphors to structure their information. It is further evident that establishing common ground and role assignment are critical aspects of collaborative synthesis. We conclude with a set of general design guidelines for collaborative synthesis support tools.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677358/","LOCKED","4677358","GeoVISTA Center, Department of Geography, Pennsylvania State University, USA","GeoVISTA Center, Department of Geography, Pennsylvania State University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37829187900","1","Anthony C.

"Insight provenance - a historical record of the process and rationale by which an insight is derived - is an essential requirement in many visual analytics applications. While work in this area has relied on either manually recorded provenance (e.g., user notes) or automatically recorded event-based insight provenance (e.g., clicks, drags, and key-presses), both approaches have fundamental limitations. Our aim is to develop a new approach that combines the benefits of both approaches while avoiding their deficiencies. Toward this goal, we characterize userspsila visual analytic activity at multiple levels of granularity. Moreover, we identify a critical level of abstraction, Actions, that can be used to represent visual analytic activity with a set of general but semantically meaningful behavior types. In turn, the action types can be used as the semantic building blocks for insight provenance. We present a catalog of common actions identified through observations of several different visual analytic systems. In addition, we define a taxonomy to categorize actions into three major classes based on their semantic intent. The concept of actions has been integrated into our labpsilas prototype visual analytic system, HARVEST, as the basis for its insight provenance capabilities.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677365/","LOCKED","4677365","IBM Thomas J.

"Visual-interactive cluster analysis provides valuable tools for effectively analyzing large and complex data sets. Due to desirable properties and an inherent predisposition for visualization, the Kohonen Feature Map (or Self-Organizing Map, or SOM) algorithm is among the most popular and widely used visual clustering techniques. However, the unsupervised nature of the algorithm may be disadvantageous in certain applications. Depending on initialization and data characteristics, cluster maps (cluster layouts) may emerge that do not comply with user preferences, expectations, or the application context. Considering SOM-based analysis of trajectory data, we propose a comprehensive visual-interactive monitoring and control framework extending the basic SOM algorithm. The framework implements the general Visual Analytics idea to effectively combine automatic data analysis with human expert supervision. It provides simple, yet effective facilities for visually monitoring and interactively controlling the trajectory clustering process at arbitrary levels of detail. The approach allows the user to leverage existing domain knowledge and user preferences, arriving at improved cluster maps. We apply the framework on a trajectory clustering problem, demonstrating its potential in combining both unsupervised (machine) and supervised (human expert) processing, in producing appropriate cluster results.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677350/","LOCKED","4677350","Interactive Graphics Systems Group, Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany","Interactive Graphics Systems Group, Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282557600","1","Tobias Schreck","37282557600","Interactive Graphics Systems Group, Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany","Interactive Graphics Systems Group, Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606179600","2","Jurgen Bernard","37606179600","Interactive Graphics Systems Group, Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany","Interactive Graphics Systems Group, Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087724135","3","Tatiana Tekusova","37087724135","Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics IGD, Darmstadt, Germany","Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics IGD, Darmstadt, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37449689200","4","Jorn Kohlhammer","37449689200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","34","0","19-24 Oct. 2008","Columbus, OH, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2008.4677350","617","10","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677350/","H.4 [Information Systems]: Information Systems Applications","I.3.6 [Computing Methodologies]: Computer Graphics—Methodology and Techniques","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Data analysis","Trajectory","Self organizing feature maps","Clustering algorithms","Monitoring","Automatic control","Humans","Data visualization","Algorithm design and analysis","Visual analytics","20081118","4677336","978-1-4244-2935-6","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-2935-6","08EX2585","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677350","19-24 Oct. 2008","4669530","2008 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2008","IEEE","30","3","Visual cluster analysis of trajectory data with interactive Kohonen Maps"
"Software tools that make it easier for analysts to collaborate as a natural part of their work will lead to better analysis that is informed by more perspectives. We are interested to know if software tools can be designed that support collaboration even as they allow analysts to find documents and organize information (including evidence, schemas, and hypotheses). We have modified the Entity Workspace system, described previously, to test such designs. We have evaluated the resulting design in both a laboratory study and a study where it is situated with an analysis team. In both cases, effects on collaboration appear to be positive. Key aspects of the design include an evidence notebook optimized for organizing entities (rather than text characters), information structures that can be collapsed and expanded, visualization of evidence that emphasizes events and documents (rather than emphasizing the entity graph), and a notification system that finds entities of mutual interest to multiple analysts.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677362/","LOCKED","4677362","Palo Alto Research Center, Inc.orporated, Palo Alto, CA, USA","Palo Alto Research Center, Inc.orporated, Palo Alto, CA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282252000","1","Eric A.

"Analyzing unstructured text streams can be challenging. One popular approach is to isolate specific themes in the text, and to visualize the connections between them. Some existing systems, like ThemeRiver, provide a temporal view of changes in themes; other systems, like In-Spire, use clustering techniques to help an analyst identify the themes at a single point in time. Narratives combines both of these techniques; it uses a temporal axis to visualize ways that concepts have changed over time, and introduces several methods to explore how those concepts relate to each other. Narratives is designed to help the user place news stories in their historical and social context by understanding how the major topics associated with them have changed over time. Users can relate articles through time by examining the topical keywords that summarize a specific news event. By tracking the attention to a news article in the form of references in social media (such as weblogs), a user discovers both important events and measures the social relevance of these stories.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677364/","LOCKED","4677364","Microsoft Research Limited","Microsoft Research Limited","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37542391000","1","Danyel Fisher","37542391000","Microsoft Research Limited","Microsoft Research Limited","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37867220900","2","Aaron Hoff","37867220900","Microsoft Research Limited","Microsoft Research Limited","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37448060300","3","George Robertson","37448060300","Microsoft Live Laboratories","Microsoft Live Laboratories","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087582035","4","Matthew Hurst","37087582035","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","25","1","19-24 Oct. 2008","Columbus, OH, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2008.4677364","888","122","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677364/","blogs","events","","","","","","","trends","time series","topic detection and tracking","I.7.m [Document and Text Processing]: Miscellaneous","I.3.8 [Computer Graphics]: Applications","","","","Blogs","Event detection","Text processing","Computer graphics","Application software","Visual analytics","Data mining","Reflection","Data visualization","Displays","20081118","4677336","978-1-4244-2935-6","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-2935-6","08EX2585","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677364","19-24 Oct. 2008","4669530","2008 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2008","IEEE","32","115","Narratives: A visualization to track narrative events as they develop"
"We describe a visual analytics (VA) infrastructure, rooted on techniques in machine learning and logic-based deductive reasoning that will assist analysts to make sense of large, complex data sets by facilitating the generation and validation of models representing relationships in the data. We use logic programming (LP) as the underlying computing machinery to encode the relations as rules and facts and compute with them. A unique aspect of our approach is that the LP rules are automatically learned, using Inductive Logic Programming, from examples of data that the analyst deems interesting when viewing the data in the high-dimensional visualization interface. Using this system, analysts will be able to construct models of arbitrary relationships in the data, explore the data for scenarios that fit the model, refine the model if necessary, and query the model to automatically analyze incoming (future) data exhibiting the encoded relationships. In other words it will support both model-driven data exploration, as well as data-driven model evolution. More importantly, by basing the construction of models on techniques from machine learning and logic-based deduction, the VA process will be both flexible in terms of modeling arbitrary, user-driven relationships in the data as well as readily scale across different data domains.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677352/","LOCKED","4677352","Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, USA","Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592970300","1","Supriya Garg","37592970300","Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University","Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085949068","2","Julia Eunju Nam","37085949068","Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, USA","Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284911300","3","I.V.

"The speed of data retrieval qualitatively affects how analysts visually explore and analyze their data. To ensure smooth interactions in massive time series datasets, one needs to address the challenges of computing ad hoc queries, distributing query load, and hiding system latency. In this paper, we present ATLAS, a visualization tool for temporal data that addresses these issues using a combination of high performance database technology, predictive caching, and level of detail management. We demonstrate ATLAS using commodity hardware on a network traffic dataset of more than a billion records.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677357/","LOCKED","4677357","University of Stanford, USA","University of Stanford, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088078959","1","Sye-Min Chan","37088078959","University of Stanford, USA","University of Stanford, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087685185","2","Ling Xiao","37087685185","University of Stanford, USA","University of Stanford, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37840462500","3","John Gerth","37840462500","University of Stanford, USA","University of Stanford, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349803800","4","Pat Hanrahan","37349803800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","20","3","19-24 Oct. 2008","Columbus, OH, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2008.4677357","626","66","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677357/","D.2.11 [Software Engineering]: Software Architectures—Domain-specific architectures","H.5.2 [Information Interfaces And Presentation]: User Interface—Graphical user interfaces (GUI)","","","","","","","K.4.0 [Information Systems Applications]: General","","","","","","","","Data visualization","Data analysis","Visual databases","Delay","Hardware","Information retrieval","Time series analysis","Telecommunication traffic","Visual analytics","Costs","20081118","4677336","978-1-4244-2935-6","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-2935-6","08EX2585","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677357","19-24 Oct. 2008","4669530","2008 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2008","IEEE","34","59","Maintaining interactivity while exploring massive time series"
"This paper introduces the application of visual analytics techniques as a novel approach for improving economic decision making. Particularly, we focus on two known problems where subjectspsila behavior consistently deviates from the optimal, the Winnerpsilas and Loserpsilas Curse. According to economists, subjects fail to recognize the profit-maximizing decision strategy in both the Winnerpsilas and Loserpsilas curse because they are unable to properly consider all the available information. As such, we have created a visual analytics tool to aid subjects in decision making under the Acquiring a Company framework common in many economic experiments. We demonstrate the added value of visual analytics in the decision making process through a series of user studies comparing standard visualization methods with interactive visual analytics techniques. Our work presents not only a basis for development and evaluation of economic visual analytic research, but also empirical evidence demonstrating the added value of applying visual analytics to general decision making tasks.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677363/","LOCKED","4677363","Department of Economics, Purdue University, USA","Department of Economics, Purdue University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681662800","1","Anya Savikhin","37681662800","Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center, USA","Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396008400","2","Ross Maciejewski","37396008400","Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center, USA","Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282598900","3","David S.

"Analysis of multidimensional data often requires careful examination of relationships across dimensions. Coordinated multiple view approaches have become commonplace in visual analysis tools because they directly support expression of complex multidimensional queries using simple interactions. However, generating such tools remains difficult because of the need to map domain-specific data structures and semantics into the idiosyncratic combinations of interdependent data and visual abstractions needed to reveal particular patterns and distributions in cross-dimensional relationships. This paper describes: (1) a method for interactively expressing sequences of multidimensional set queries by cross-filtering data values across pairs of views, and (2) design strategies for constructing coordinated multiple view interfaces for cross-filtered visual analysis of multidimensional data sets. Using examples of cross-filtered visualizations of data from several different domains, we describe how cross-filtering can be modularized and reused across designs, flexibly customized with respect to data types across multiple dimensions, and incorporated into more wide-ranging multiple view designs. The demonstrated analytic utility of these examples suggest that cross-filtering is a suitable design pattern for instantiation in a wide variety of visual analysis tools.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677370/","LOCKED","4677370","The GeoVISTA Center and Department of Geography, Pennsylvania State University, USA","The GeoVISTA Center and Department of Geography, Pennsylvania State University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564883300","1","Chris Weaver","37564883300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","19","3","19-24 Oct. 2008","Columbus, OH, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2008.4677370","414","170","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677370/","D.2.2 [Software Engineering]: Design Tools and Techniques—[User Interfaces]","H.2.3 [Information Systems]: Database Management—[Languages]","","","","","","","H.5.2 [Information Systems]: Information Interfaces and Presentation—[User Interfaces]","","","","","","","","Multidimensional systems","Data analysis","Data visualization","Pattern analysis","Management information systems","Prototypes","Usability","Geography","Data structures","Software engineering","20081118","4677336","978-1-4244-2935-6","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-2935-6","08EX2585","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677370","19-24 Oct. 2008","4669530","2008 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2008","IEEE","36","163","Multidimensional visual analysis using cross-filtered views"
"It has been widely accepted that interactive visualization techniques enable users to more effectively form hypotheses and identify areas for more detailed investigation. There have been numerous empirical user studies testing the effectiveness of specific visual analytical tools. However, there has been limited effort in connecting a user’s interaction with his reasoning for the purpose of extracting the relationship between the two. In this paper, we present an approach for capturing and analyzing user interactions in a financial visual analytical tool and describe an exploratory user study that examines these interaction strategies. To achieve this goal, we created two visual tools to analyze raw interaction data captured during the user session. The results of this study demonstrate one possible strategy for understanding the relationship between interaction and reasoning both operationally and strategically.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677360/","LOCKED","4677360","Viscenter, UNC-Charlotte, USA","Viscenter, UNC-Charlotte, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37400451800","1","Dong Hyun Jeong","37400451800","Viscenter, UNC-Charlotte, USA","Viscenter, UNC-Charlotte, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087173877","2","Wenwen Dou","37087173877","HCI Laboratory, UNC-Charlotte, USA","HCI Laboratory, UNC-Charlotte, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601288800","3","Heather Richter Lipford","37601288800","Viscenter, UNC-Charlotte, USA","Viscenter, UNC-Charlotte, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601289000","4","Felesia Stukes","37601289000","Viscenter, UNC-Charlotte, USA","Viscenter, UNC-Charlotte, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592409400","5","Remco Chang","37592409400","HCI Laboratory, UNC-Charlotte, USA","HCI Laboratory, UNC-Charlotte, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300425000","6","William Ribarsky","37300425000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","17","1","19-24 Oct. 2008","Columbus, OH, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2008.4677360","388","90","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677360/","H.5.2 [Information Interfaces And Presentation (e.g., HCI)]: User Interfaces—Evaluation/methodology","H.5.2 [Information Interfaces And Presentation (e.g., HCI)]: User Interfaces—Graphical user interfaces (GUI)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Human computer interaction","Testing","Visual analytics","Wire","Data visualization","Joining processes","Data mining","Data analysis","User interfaces","Graphical user interfaces","20081118","4677336","978-1-4244-2935-6","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-2935-6","08EX2585","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677360","19-24 Oct. 2008","4669530","2008 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2008","IEEE","37","83","Evaluating the relationship between user interaction and financial visual analysis"
"Understanding multivariate relationships is an important task in multivariate data analysis. Unfortunately, existing multivariate visualization systems lose effectiveness when analyzing relationships among variables that span more than a few dimensions. We present a novel multivariate visual explanation approach that helps users interactively discover multivariate relationships among a large number of dimensions by integrating automatic numerical differentiation techniques and multidimensional visualization techniques. The result is an efficient workflow for multivariate analysis model construction, interactive dimension reduction, and multivariate knowledge discovery leveraging both automatic multivariate analysis and interactive multivariate data visual exploration. Case studies and a formal user study with a real dataset illustrate the effectiveness of this approach.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677368/","LOCKED","4677368","Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA","Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591128900","1","Scott Barlowe","37591128900","Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA","Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087142946","2","Tianyi Zhang","37087142946","Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA","Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087221047","3","Yujie Liu","37087221047","Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA","Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37292632600","4","Jing Yang","37292632600","Department of Physics and Optical Science, University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA","Department of Physics and Optical Science, University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37883522400","5","Donald Jacobs","37883522400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","13","0","19-24 Oct. 2008","Columbus, OH, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2008.4677368","554","154","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677368/","visual analysis","multivariate analysis","","","","","","","dimension reduction","multivariate model construction","multivariate visualization","H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: User Interfaces—User Centered Design","G.3 [Mathematics of Computing]: Probability and Statistics—Multivariate Statistics","","","","Data visualization","Displays","Statistical analysis","Optical scattering","Data analysis","Solvents","Proteins","Computer science","Jacobian matrices","Physics","20081118","4677336","978-1-4244-2935-6","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-2935-6","08EX2585","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677368","19-24 Oct. 2008","4669530","2008 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2008","IEEE","38","147","Multivariate visual explanation for high dimensional datasets"
"When analyzing syndromic surveillance data, health care officials look for areas with unusually high cases of syndromes. Unfortunately, many outbreaks are difficult to detect because their signal is obscured by the statistical noise. Consequently, many detection algorithms have a high false positive rate. While many false alerts can be easily filtered by trained epidemiologists, others require health officials to drill down into the data, analyzing specific segments of the population and historical trends over time and space. Furthermore, the ability to accurately recognize meaningful patterns in the data becomes more challenging as these data sources increase in volume and complexity. To facilitate more accurate and efficient event detection, we have created a visual analytics tool that provides analysts with linked geo-spatiotemporal and statistical analytic views. We model syndromic hotspots by applying a kernel density estimation on the population sample. When an analyst selects a syndromic hotspot, temporal statistical graphs of the hotspot are created. Similarly, regions in the statistical plots may be selected to generate geospatial features specific to the current time period. Demographic filtering can then be combined to determine if certain populations are more affected than others. These tools allow analysts to perform real-time hypothesis testing and evaluation.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677354/","LOCKED","4677354","Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center, USA","Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396008400","1","Ross Maciejewski","37396008400","Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center, USA","Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396006000","2","Stephen Rudolph","37396006000","Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center, USA","Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38512951900","3","Ryan Hafen","38512951900","Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center, USA","Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37872486500","4","Ahmad Abusalah","37872486500","Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center, USA","Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38179941700","5","Mohamed Yakout","38179941700","Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center, USA","Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37374971700","6","Mourad Ouzzani","37374971700","Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center, USA","Purdue University Regional Visualization and Analytics Center, USA","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282344300","7","William S.

"A central challenge in visual analytics is the creation of accessible, widely distributable analysis applications that bring the benefits of visual discovery to as broad a user base as possible. Moreover, to support the role of visualization in the knowledge creation process, it is advantageous to allow users to describe the reasoning strategies they employ while interacting with analytic environments. We introduce an application suite called the scalable reasoning system (SRS), which provides Web-based and mobile interfaces for visual analysis. The service-oriented analytic framework that underlies SRS provides a platform for deploying pervasive visual analytic environments across an enterprise. SRS represents a ldquolightweightrdquo approach to visual analytics whereby thin client analytic applications can be rapidly deployed in a platform-agnostic fashion. Client applications support multiple coordinated views while giving analysts the ability to record evidence, assumptions, hypotheses and other reasoning artifacts.

"USPEX is a crystal structure predictor based on an evolutionary algorithm. Every USPEX run produces hundreds or thousands of crystal structures, some of which may be identical. To ease the extraction of unique and potentially interesting structures we applied usual high-dimensional classification concepts to the unusual field of crystallography. We experimented with various crystal structure descriptors, distinct distance measures and tried different clustering methods to identify groups of similar structures. These methods are already applied in combinatorial chemistry to organic molecules for a different goal and in somewhat different forms, but are not widely used for crystal structures classification. We adopted a visual design and validation method in the development of a library (CrystalFp) and an end-user application to select and validate method choices, to gain userspsila acceptance and to tap into their domain expertise. The use of the classifier has already accelerated the analysis of USPEX output by at least one order of magnitude, promoting some new crystallographic insight and discovery. Furthermore the visual display of key algorithm indicators has led to diverse, unexpected discoveries that will improve the USPEX algorithms.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677351/","LOCKED","4677351","Data Analysis and Visualization Services, Swiss National Supercomputing Centre, Switzerland","Data Analysis and Visualization Services, Swiss National Supercomputing Centre, Switzerland","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37866298300","1","Mario Valle","37866298300","Laboratory of Crystallography, Department of Materials, ETH Zürich","Laboratory of Crystallography, Department of Materials, ETH Zürich","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37570687200","2","Artem R.

"Social network graphs, concept maps, and process charts are examples of diagrammatic representations employed by intelligence analysts to understand complex systems. Unfortunately, these 2D representations currently do not easily convey the flow, sequence, tempo and other important dynamic behaviors within these systems. In this paper we present Configurable Spaces, a novel analytical method for visualizing patterns of activity over time in complex diagrammatically- represented systems. Configurable Spaces extends GeoTime's X, Y, T coordinate workspace space for temporal analysis to any arbitrary diagrammatic work space by replacing a geographic map with a diagram. This paper traces progress from concept to prototype, and discusses how diagrams can be created, transformed and leveraged for analysis, including generating diagrams from knowledge bases, visualizing temporal concept maps, and the use of linked diagrams for exploring complex, multi-dimensional, sequences of events. An evaluation of the prototype by the National Institute of Standards and Technology showed intelligence analysts believed they were able to attain an increased level of insight, were able to explore data more efficiently, and that Configurable Spaces would help them work faster.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677355/","LOCKED","4677355","Oculus Info Inc., USA","Oculus Info Inc., USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37704437500","1","Thomas Kapler","37704437500","Oculus Info Inc., USA","Oculus Info Inc., USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37425695700","2","Ryan Eccles","37425695700","Oculus Info Inc., USA","Oculus Info Inc., USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37594531000","3","Robert Harper","37594531000","Oculus Info Inc., USA","Oculus Info Inc., USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37654961400","4","William Wright","37654961400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7","1","19-24 Oct. 2008","Columbus, OH, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2008.4677355","275","50","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677355/","human information interaction","visual analytics","","","","","","","graph visualization","geo-temporal analysis","concept maps","","","","","","Space technology","Prototypes","Data visualization","Visual analytics","Social network services","Pattern analysis","NIST","Humans","Graphical user interfaces","Information analysis","20081118","4677336","978-1-4244-2935-6","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-2935-6","08EX2585","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677355","19-24 Oct. 2008","4669530","2008 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2008","IEEE","44","43","Configurable Spaces: Temporal analysis in diagrammatic contexts"
"We seek an information-revealing representation for high-dimensional data distributions that may contain local trends in certain subspaces. Examples are data that have continuous support in simple shapes with identifiable branches. Such data can be represented by a graph that consists of segments of locally fit principal curves or surfaces summarizing each identifiable branch. We describe a new algorithm to find the optimal paths through such a principal graph. The paths are optimal in the sense that they represent the longest smooth trends through the data set, and jointly they cover the data set entirely with minimum overlap. The algorithm is suitable for hypothesizing trends in high-dimensional data, and can assist exploratory data analysis and visualization.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677367/","LOCKED","4677367","Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University","Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37673742400","1","Chandan K.

"With advances in computing techniques, a large amount of high-resolution high-quality multimedia data (video and audio, etc.) has been collected in research laboratories in various scientific disciplines, particularly in social and behavioral studies. How to automatically and effectively discover new knowledge from rich multimedia data poses a compelling challenge since state-of-the-art data mining techniques can most often only search and extract pre-defined patterns or knowledge from complex heterogeneous data. In light of this, our approach is to take advantages of both the power of human perception system and the power of computational algorithms. More specifically, we propose an approach that allows scientists to use data mining as a first pass, and then forms a closed loop of visual analysis of current results followed by more data mining work inspired by visualization, the results of which can be in turn visualized and lead to the next round of visual exploration and analysis. In this way, new insights and hypotheses gleaned from the raw data and the current level of analysis can contribute to further analysis. As a first step toward this goal, we implement a visualization system with three critical components: (1) A smooth interface between visualization and data mining. The new analysis results can be automatically loaded into our visualization tool. (2) A flexible tool to explore and query temporal data derived from raw multimedia data. We represent temporal data into two forms - continuous variables and event variables. We have developed various ways to visualize both temporal correlations and statistics of multiple variables with the same type, and conditional and high-order statistics between continuous and event variables. (3) A seamless interface between raw multimedia data and derived data. Our visualization tool allows users to explore, compare, and analyze multi-stream derived variables and simultaneously switch to access raw multimedia data. We demonstrate various functions in our visualization program using a set of multimedia data including video, audio and motion tracking data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677369/","LOCKED","4677369","Indiana University, USA","Indiana University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087170793","1","Chen Yu","37087170793","Indiana University, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, USA","Indiana University, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087173640","2","Yiwen Zhong","37087173640","Indiana University, USA","Indiana University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37872609000","3","Thomas Smith","37872609000","Indiana University, USA","Indiana University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37872999700","4","Ikhyun Park","37872999700","Indiana University, USA","Indiana University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087173796","5","Weixia Huang","37087173796","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","6","19-24 Oct. 2008","Columbus, OH, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2008.4677369","1180","162","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4677369/","visual data mining","multimedia data","","","","","","","H.1.2 [Information Systems]: Models and principles - user/machine systems","H.5.1 [Information Interface and Presentation]: Multimedia Information Systems","H.5.2 [Information Interface and Presentation]: User Interfaces — Graphical user interfaces (GUI)","H.3.3 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Information Search and Retrieval","H.2.8 [Database Management]: Database Applications —Data mining","","","","Data mining","Data visualization","Multimedia databases","Multimedia computing","Laboratories","Humans","Statistics","Switches","Management information systems","Multimedia systems","20081118","4677336","978-1-4244-2935-6","Print ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4244-2935-6","08EX2585","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4677369","19-24 Oct. 2008","4669530","2008 IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology","2008","IEEE","46","155","Visual mining of multimedia data for social and behavioral studies"
