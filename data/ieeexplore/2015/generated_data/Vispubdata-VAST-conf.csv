With access to movement tracking information of visitors, the task of mini challenge 1 was to identify patterns of attendance and park's activities. Understanding visitor groups and monitoring visitors' activities are vitally important for mangers to provide exceptional service and handle unexpected situations. Facing the large and complex tracking dataset, visual analytic system should not only be able to present the overall situation, but also help operators to analyze information and compare between different patterns.",,Shuang Wei;Kai Hu;Longjie Cheng;Hui Tang;Weidan Du;Chen Guo;Chao Pan;Mingran Li;Bing Yu;Xinzhe Li;YingJie Victor Chen;Zhenyu Cherly Qian;Yu Michael Zhu,"Computer Graphics Technology, India;Interaction Design, Russia;Statistics, Purdue University, USA;Computer Graphics Technology, India;Computer Graphics Technology, India;Computer Graphics Technology, India;Statistics, Purdue University, USA;Computer Graphics Technology, India;Statistics, Purdue University, USA;New Media Technology and Art, Harbin Institute of Technology, China;Computer Graphics Technology, India;Interaction Design, Russia;Statistics, Purdue University, USA",,"Visual Analytics,Statistical Analytics,Information Visualization,Information Interfaces,User Interfaces,",,0,,

For further analysis these missing values need to be imputed. Thus, imputation of such missing values is important in a wide range of applications. We propose a visually and statistically guided imputation approach, that allows applying different imputation techniques to estimate the missing values as well as evaluating and fine tuning the imputation by visual guidance. In our approach we include additional visual information about uncertainty and employ the cyclic structure of time inherent in the data. Including this cyclic structure enables visually judging the adequateness of the estimated values with respect to the uncertainty/error boundaries and according to the patterns of the neighbouring time points in linear and cyclic (e.g., the months of the year) time.",,M.

In 2001, Barnes and Roeder defined a set of contours corresponding to compositional fields for spinel group minerals. Geologists typically use this contours to estimate the tectonic environment where a particular spinel composition could have been formed. This task is prone to errors and requires tedious manual comparison of overlapping diagrams. We introduce a semi-automatic, interactive detection of tectonic settings for an arbitrary dataset based on the Barnes and Roeder contours. The new approach integrates the mentioned contours and includes a novel interaction called contour brush.

Therefore, we propose to use a learning-based method with an interface design to uncover the trending event compositions for time-series categorical log data, which can be extend to other datasets, e.g., the hashtags in social media. First, we perform “trending pool” operation to save the memory and time cost. Second, we apply sparse coding to learn important trending candidate combination sets instead of traditional brute-force way or manual investigation for generating combinations.

It replays movement logs over time and demonstrates communication logs with dynamic links. SpectrumView shows the status of all visitors' activities within a period of time. Each stay of visitors in a location is visualized as a line segment. The duration and location type of the stay are encoded by the length and color of the segment. Accumulating segments of the same visitor horizontally and aligning sequences of segments from different visitors form a general view of all visitors' activities.

These simulations are often used by weather analysts to analyze the nature of uncertainty attributed by these simulations to forecast weather conditions with good accuracy. The number of simulations used for forecasting is growing with the advent of increase in computing power. Hence, there is a need for providing better visual insights of uncertainty with growing number of ensemble members. We propose a geo visual analytical framework that uses visual analytics approach to resolve visual scalability of these ensemble members. Our approach naturally fits with the workflow of an analyst analyzing ensemble spatial uncertainty. Meteorologists evaluated our framework qualitatively and found it to be effective in acquiring insights of spatial uncertainty associated with multiple ensemble runs that are simulated using multiple parameterization schemes.",,Sujan Anreddy;Song Zhang;Andrew Mercer;Jamie Dyer;J.

Even with advanced pruning methods, it is often difficult for researchers to see how the cohort is being selected; consequently, these methods are underutilized in research. Visual Pruner is a free, easy-to-use web application that can improve both the credibility and generalizability of observational studies by letting analysts use updatable visual displays of estimated propensity scores and key baseline covariates to refine inclusion criteria. By helping researchers see how covariate distributions in their data relate to the estimated probabilities of treatment assignment, the app lets researchers make pruning decisions based on pre-treatment covariate patterns that are otherwise hard to discover.

The existing analysis practice for multi-level simulation results is to manually compare results from different levels of complexity, amounting to a very tedious and error-prone, trial-and-error exploration process. In this paper, we introduce hierarchical visual steering, a new approach to the exploration and design of complex systems. Hierarchical visual steering makes it possible to explore and analyze hierarchical simulation ensembles at different levels of complexity. At each level, we deal with a dynamic simulation ensemble - the ensemble grows during the exploration process. There is at least one such ensemble per simulation level, resulting in a collection of dynamic ensembles, analyzed simultaneously. The key challenge is to map the multi-dimensional parameter space of one ensemble to the multi-dimensional parameter space of another ensemble (from another level). In order to support the interactive visual analysis of such complex data we propose a novel approach to interactive and semi-automatic parameter space segmentation and comparison. The approach combines a novel interaction technique and automatic, computational methods - clustering, concave hull computation, and concave polygon overlapping - to support the analysts in the cross-ensemble parameter space mapping. In addition to the novel parameter space segmentation we also deploy coordinated multiple views with standard plots. We describe the abstract analysis tasks, identified during a case study, i.e., the design of a variable valve actuation system of a car engine.

Although techniques based on aggregation, topology, and topic modeling have proven their usefulness, the visual analysis of smooth and/or abrupt data variations as well as the evolution of such variations over time are aspects not properly tackled by existing methods. In this work we propose a novel visualization methodology that relies on graph wavelet theory and stacked graph metaphor to enable the visual analysis of time-varying data defined on the nodes of a graph. The proposed method is able to identify regions where data presents abrupt and mild spacial and/or temporal variation while still been able to show how such changes evolve over time, making the identification of events an easier task. The usefulness of our approach is shown through a set of results using synthetic as well as a real data set involving taxi trips in downtown Manhattan. The methodology was able to reveal interesting phenomena and events such as the identification of specific locations with abrupt variation in the number of taxi pickups.",,Paola Valdivia;Fabio Dias;Fabiano Petronetto;Cláudio T.

Due to its high input dimensionality, time requirements, and resource constraints, simulating over the entire parameter space is unfeasible. One solution is to take a granular sampling of the input space and use simpler predictive models (emulators) in between. The quality of the implemented emulator depends on many factors: robustness, sophistication, configuration, and suitability to the input data. Visual analytics can be leveraged to provide guidance and understanding of these things to the user. In this paper, we have implemented a novel interface and workflow for emulator building and use. We introduce a workflow to build emulators, make predictions, and then analyze the results. Our prediction process first predicts temporal time series, and uses these to derive predicted spatial densities. Integrated into the EpiSimS framework, we target users who are non-experts at statistical modeling. This approach allows for a high level of analysis into the state of the built emulators and their resultant predictions. We present our workflow, models, the associated system, and evaluate the overall utility with feedback from EpiSimS scientists.",,Chris Bryan;Xue Wu;Susan Mniszewski;Kwan-Liu Ma,"VIDi @ U.C.

Our approach enables the user to quickly identify the most similar groups of ensemble members, as well as the locations where the variation among the members is high. We further provide means to visualize the main features of the potentially multimodal directional distributions at user-selected locations. For this purpose, directional data is modelled using mixtures of probability density functions (pdfs), which allows us to characterize and classify complex distributions with relatively few parameters. The resulting mixture models are used to determine the degree of similarity between ensemble members, and to construct glyphs showing the direction, spread, and strength of the principal modes of the directional distributions. We also propose several similarity measures, based on which we compute pairwise member similarities in the spatial domain and form clusters of similar members. The hierarchical clustering is shown using dendrograms and similarity matrices, which can be used to select particular members and visualize their variations. A user interface providing multiple linked views enables the simultaneous visualization of aggregated global and detailed local variations, as well as the selection of members for a detailed comparison.",,Mihaela Jarema;Ismail Demir;Johannes Kehrer;Rüdiger Westermann,"Technische Universität München, Germany;Technische Universität München, Germany;Technische Universität München, Germany;Technische Universität München, Germany",,"Uncertainty Visualization,Vector Field Data,Coordinated and Multiple Views,Glyph-based Techniques,,",,16,,
VAST-conf,2015,Urbane: A 3D framework to support data driven decision making in urban development,10.1109/VAST.2015.7347636,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2015.7347636,97,104,Conferences,"Architects working with developers and city planners typically rely on experience, precedent and data analyzed in isolation when making decisions that impact the character of a city. These decisions are critical in enabling vibrant, sustainable environments but must also negotiate a range of complex political and social forces. This requires those shaping the built environment to balance maximizing the value of a new development with its impact on the character of a neighborhood. As a result architects are focused on two issues throughout the decision making process: a) what defines the character of a neighborhood? and b) how will a new development change its neighborhood? In the first, character can be influenced by a variety of factors and understanding the interplay between diverse data sets is crucial; including safety, transportation access, school quality and access to entertainment. In the second, the impact of a new development is measured, for example, by how it impacts the view from the buildings that surround it. In this paper, we work in collaboration with architects to design Urbane, a 3-dimensional multi-resolution framework that enables a data-driven approach for decision making in the design of new urban development. This is accomplished by integrating multiple data layers and impact analysis techniques facilitating architects to explore and assess the effect of these attributes on the character and value of a neighborhood. Several of these data layers, as well as impact analysis, involve working in 3-dimensions and operating in real time. Efficient computation and visualization is accomplished through the use of techniques from computer graphics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Urbane through a case study of development in Manhattan depicting how a data-driven understanding of the value and impact of speculative buildings can benefit the design-development process between architects, planners and developers.",,Nivan Ferreira;Marcos Lage;Harish Doraiswamy;Huy Vo;Luc Wilson;Heidi Werner;Muchan Park;Cláudio Silva,"New York University, USA;Universidade Federal Fluminense, Brazil;New York University, USA;New York University, USA;Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates PC, USA;Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates PC, USA;Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates PC, USA;New York University, USA",,"Urban data analysis,GIS,impact analysis,visual analytics,architecture,city development",,12,,

The simplicity of the format belied a complex wealth of features contained in the data that needed to be discovered and understood to solve the tasks and questions that were posed. Two Mini-Challenges and a Grand Challenge compose the 2015 competition. Mini-Challenge 1 contained structured location and date-time data for park visitors, against which participants were to discern groups and their activities. Mini-Challenge 2 contained structured communication data consisting of metadata about time-stamped text messages sent between park visitors. The Grand Challenge required participants to use both movement and communication data to hypothesize when a crime was committed and identify the most likely suspects from all the park visitors.

Visual analytic tools provide interactive visual interfaces to data to support discovery and sensemaking tasks, including forming hypotheses, asking questions, and evaluating and organizing evidence. Myriad analytic models can be incorporated into visual analytic systems at the cost of increasing complexity in the analytic discourse between user and system. Techniques exist to increase the usability of interacting with analytic models, such as inferring data models from user interactions to steer the underlying models of the system via semantic interaction, shielding users from having to do so explicitly. Such approaches are often also referred to as mixed-initiative systems. Sensemaking researchers have called for development of tools that facilitate analytic sensemaking through a combination of human and automated activities. However, design guidelines do not exist for mixed-initiative visual analytic systems to support iterative sensemaking. In this paper, we present candidate design guidelines and introduce the Active Data Environment (ADE) prototype, a spatial workspace supporting the analytic process via task recommendations invoked by inferences about user interactions within the workspace. ADE recommends data and relationships based on a task model, enabling users to co-reason with the system about their data in a single, spatial workspace.

Individual analysts work on loosely related problems, and must share their findings with each other and the organization at large, moving results from exploratory data analyses (EDA) into automated visualizations, diagnostics and reports deployed for wider consumption. There are two problems with the current practice. First, there are gaps in this workflow: EDA is performed with one set of tools, and automated reports and deployments with another. Second, these environments often assume a single-developer perspective, while data scientist teams could get much benefit from easier sharing of scripts and data feeds, experiments, annotations, and automated recommendations, which are well beyond what traditional version control systems provide. We contribute and justify the following three requirements for systems built to support current data science teams and users: discoverability, technology transfer, and coexistence. In addition, we contribute the design and implementation of RCloud, a system that supports the requirements of collaborative data analysis, visualization and web deployment.

In this paper, we introduce a novel visual text analytics system, DemographicVis, to aid interactive analysis of such demographic information based on user-generated content. Our approach connects categorical data (demographic information) with textual data, allowing users to understand the characteristics of different demographic groups in a transparent and exploratory manner. The modeling and visualization are based on ground truth demographic information collected via a survey conducted on Reddit.com. Detailed user information is taken into our modeling process that connects the demographic groups with features that best describe the distinguishing characteristics of each group. Features including topical and linguistic are generated from the user-generated contents. Such features are then analyzed and ranked based on their ability to predict the users' demographic information. To enable interactive demographic analysis, we introduce a web-based visual interface that presents the relationship of the demographic groups, their topic interests, as well as the predictive power of various features.

However, the influence and interplay of these parameters is often not clear, making exhaustive evaluations necessary.

First, representative parameter settings are determined. Then, the respective output is computed and statistically analyzed to assess parameters' influence in general. Finally, visualizing the parameter settings along with the activities provides overview and allows to investigate the computed results in detail. Coordinated interaction helps to explore dependencies, compare different settings, and examine individual activities. By integrating automated, visual, and interactive means users can select parameter values that meet desired quality criteria.

Players frequently have to deal with the trade-off between high frame rates and good resolution. Analyzing patterns in frame rate data and their correlation with the overall game performance is important in designing games (e.g., graphic card/display setting suggestion and game performance measurement). However, this task is challenging because game frame rates vary both temporally and spatially. In addition, players may adjust their display settings based on their gaming experience and hardware conditions, which further contributes to the unpredictability of frame rates. In this paper, we present a comprehensive visual analytics system FPSSeer, to help game designers gain insight into frame rate data. Our system consists of four major views: 1) a frame rate view to show the overall distribution in a geographic scale, 2) a grid view to show the frame rate distribution and grid element clusters based on their similarity, 3) a FootRiver view to reveal the temporal patterns in game condition changes and potential spatiotemporal correlations, and 4) a comparison view to evaluate game performance discrepancy under different game tests.
