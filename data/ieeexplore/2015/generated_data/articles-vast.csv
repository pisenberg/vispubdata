"The 2015 VAST mini challenge conjured up an amusement park - DinoFun World, which owns hundreds of hectares and hosts thousands of visitors every day. With access to movement tracking information of visitors, the task of mini challenge 1 was to identify patterns of attendance and park's activities. Understanding visitor groups and monitoring visitors' activities are vitally important for mangers to provide exceptional service and handle unexpected situations. Facing the large and complex tracking dataset, visual analytic system should not only be able to present the overall situation, but also help operators to analyze information and compare between different patterns.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347668/","LOCKED","7347668","Computer Graphics Technology, India","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085693562","1","Shuang Wei","37085693562","Computer Graphics Technology, India","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085698494","11","YingJie Victor Chen","37085698494","Interaction Design, Russia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38238364000","12","Zhenyu Cherly Qian","38238364000","Statistics, Purdue University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085688316","13","Yu Michael Zhu","37085688316","","","","","","Interaction Design, Russia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085698691","2","Kai Hu","37085698691","Statistics, Purdue University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085681292","3","Longjie Cheng","37085681292","Computer Graphics Technology, India","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085688731","4","Hui Tang","37085688731","Computer Graphics Technology, India","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085690214","5","Weidan Du","37085690214","Computer Graphics Technology, India","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085422417","6","Chen Guo","37085422417","Statistics, Purdue University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085679186","7","Chao Pan","37085679186","Computer Graphics Technology, India","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085693878","8","Mingran Li","37085693878","Statistics, Purdue University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085697237","9","Bing Yu","37085697237","New Media Technology and Art, Harbin Institute of Technology, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085695327","10","Xinzhe Li","37085695327","0","0","25-30 Oct. 2015","Chicago, IL, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2015.7347668","178","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347668/","Visual Analytics","Statistical Analytics","Information Visualization","Information Interfaces","User Interfaces","","Data visualization","Indexes","Visualization","Image color analysis","","","","7347613","978-1-4673-9783-4","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-9783-4","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347668","25-30 Oct. 2015","7337653","2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2015","IEEE","1","177","CrowdAnalyzer: A collaborative visual analytic system"
"Missing values are a problem in many real world applications, for example failing sensor measurements. For further analysis these missing values need to be imputed. Thus, imputation of such missing values is important in a wide range of applications. We propose a visually and statistically guided imputation approach, that allows applying different imputation techniques to estimate the missing values as well as evaluating and fine tuning the imputation by visual guidance. In our approach we include additional visual information about uncertainty and employ the cyclic structure of time inherent in the data. Including this cyclic structure enables visually judging the adequateness of the estimated values with respect to the uncertainty/error boundaries and according to the patterns of the neighbouring time points in linear and cyclic (e.g., the months of the year) time.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347672/","LOCKED","7347672","Vienna University of Technology, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077691500","1","M.

"The VAST Challenge has been a popular venue for academic and industry participants for over ten years. Many participants comment that the majority of their time in preparing VAST Challenge entries is discovering elements in their software environments that need to be redesigned in order to solve the given task. Fortunately, there is no need to wait until the VAST Challenge is announced to test out software systems. The Visual Analytics Benchmark Repository contains all past VAST Challenge tasks, data, solutions and submissions. In this poster we describe how developers can perform informal evaluations of various aspects of their visual analytics environments using VAST Challenge information.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347674/","LOCKED","7347674","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085505404","1","Kristin A.

"Spinel group minerals are excellent indicators of geological environments (tectonic settings). In 2001, Barnes and Roeder defined a set of contours corresponding to compositional fields for spinel group minerals. Geologists typically use this contours to estimate the tectonic environment where a particular spinel composition could have been formed. This task is prone to errors and requires tedious manual comparison of overlapping diagrams. We introduce a semi-automatic, interactive detection of tectonic settings for an arbitrary dataset based on the Barnes and Roeder contours. The new approach integrates the mentioned contours and includes a novel interaction called contour brush. The new methodology is integrated in the Spinel Explorer system and it improves the scientist's workflow significantly.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347676/","LOCKED","7347676","VyGLab, UNS, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085462425","1","María Luján Ganuza","37085462425","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","INGEOSUR CONICET, Argentina","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085735988","2","Florencia Gargiulo","37085735988","INGEOSUR CONICET, Argentina","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085462057","3","Gabriela Ferracutti","37085462057","VyGLab, UNS, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085463520","4","Silvia Castro","37085463520","INGEOSUR CONICET, Argentina","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085469073","5","Ernesto Bjerg","37085469073","TU Wien, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284271200","6","Eduard Gröller","37284271200","VRVis, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37947312900","7","Krešimir Matković","37947312900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","0","25-30 Oct. 2015","Chicago, IL, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2015.7347676","198","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347676/","","","","","","","Minerals","Brushes","Three-dimensional displays","Rocks","Manuals","Standards","","7347613","978-1-4673-9783-4","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-9783-4","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347676","25-30 Oct. 2015","7337653","2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2015","IEEE","5","197","Interactive semi-automatic categorization for spinel group minerals"
"The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has made public a data set showing what hospitals charged and what Medicare paid for the one hundred most common inpatient stays. Here we present the application of Reduced Basis Decomposition (RBD), an efficient novel dimension reduction algorithm for data processing, to the CMS data. This was paired with a comparative visual exploration of the results when put into context with characteristics of the hospitals and marketplaces in which they operate. We used Weave Analyst, a new web-based analysis and visualization environment, to visualize the relationship between the hospital groups, their charge levels, and distinguishing indicator variables. Particular insights to the relatively small number of underlying factors that exert greatest influence on hospital pricing surfaced thanks to the combined synergetic integration of the modeling, reduction, and visualization techniques.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347680/","LOCKED","7347680","University of Massachusetts Lowell, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085651320","1","Miriam Perkins","37085651320","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085654076","2","Yanlai Chen","37085654076","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","25-30 Oct. 2015","Chicago, IL, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2015.7347680","206","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347680/","G.1.m [Numerical Analysis]: Numerical Linear Algebra-Miscellaneous","H.1.2 [Information Systems]: User/Machine Systems-Human information processing","J.3.m [Life and Medical Sciences]: Health-Miscellaneous","","","","Hospitals","Data visualization","Weaving","Medical diagnostic imaging","Pricing","Algorithm design and analysis","Visualization","7347613","978-1-4673-9783-4","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-9783-4","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347680","25-30 Oct. 2015","7337653","2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2015","IEEE","6","205","Using visualization and analysis with efficient dimension Reduction to determine underlying factors in hospital inpatient procedure costs"
"The VAST 2015 Grand Challenge focused on a fictional park called DinoFunWorld where visitors are provided with a handheld device for communicating with park patrons and registering their visits to rides. Our goal was to develop a visual analytics system to help explore the spatiotemporal movement and communication data of the park patrons. Specifically, we wanted was to determine which patrons were involved in a theft that occurred at a park pavilion. In order to facilitate this data exploration, we have created a web-deployable system that combines data wrangling, trajectory analysis, network analysis, and interactive visualizations for discovering movement and communication patterns of users and their networks.

"Although many visualization tools provide us plenty of ways to view the data, users can not easily find the trending events and their explanation from the data. In this work, we address the issue by leveraging the real music streaming log data as an example to better understand a million-scale dataset. Trending event explanation turns out to be challenging when it comes to categorical log data. Therefore, we propose to use a learning-based method with an interface design to uncover the trending event compositions for time-series categorical log data, which can be extend to other datasets, e.g., the hashtags in social media. First, we perform “trending pool” operation to save the memory and time cost. Second, we apply sparse coding to learn important trending candidate combination sets instead of traditional brute-force way or manual investigation for generating combinations. Besides the contributions above, we also observe some interesting user behaviors by exploring detected trending candidate combinations visually through our interface.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347688/","LOCKED","7347688","National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085668478","1","Yi-Chih Tsai","37085668478","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37943572900","2","Liang-Chi Hsieh","37943572900","National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085671029","3","Wen-Feng Cheng","37085671029","National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38181858100","4","Yin-Hsi Kuo","38181858100","National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085664755","5","Winston Hsu","37085664755","National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085663965","6","Wen-Chin Chen","37085663965","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","25-30 Oct. 2015","Chicago, IL, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2015.7347688","222","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347688/","Visual analytics","time-series","categorical data","","","","Encoding","Market research","Visual analytics","Image color analysis","Layout","Learning systems","Music","7347613","978-1-4673-9783-4","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-9783-4","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347688","25-30 Oct. 2015","7337653","2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2015","IEEE","18","221","Trending pool: Visual analytics for trending event compositions for time-series categorical log data"

"Overall attendance at DinoFun World is characterized in figure 2. The number of moves park-goers make is charted for each minute of the day along a horizontal time axis. We can learn a couple of things from this plot: (1) the Scott Jones show was held from 10 to 11 during all mornings and from 3 to 4 in the afternoons of Friday and Saturday. We can see this from the dip in movements (orange lines are average number of moves during one hour) during this time, and the spikes immediately at the end of the show (when a lot of people move out of the area). The second show on Sunday was cancelled: the dip in movements is missing on Sunday afternoon. This is also visible in figure 2, showing check-ins by area: people check into the Grinosaurus Stage, where the Scott Jones show is hosted, before 10 am for all days but before 3 pm only on Friday and Saturday. (2) there is a spike in movements on Sunday at around 2:30 pm - judging from the movement pattern these are people on their way to the Scott Jones show who get turned away (because there are no check-ins to the Grinosaurus Stage), see also figure 3.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347659/","LOCKED","7347659","Iowa State University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592793000","1","Heike Hofmann","37592793000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Monash University, Australia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085609217","2","Dianne Cook","37085609217","Iowa State University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085614364","3","Andee Kaplan","37085614364","Iowa State University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085621809","4","Eric Hare","37085621809","Iowa State University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085623906","5","Vianey Leos-Barajas","37085623906","Iowa State University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085622905","6","Carson Sievert","37085622905","Iowa State University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085620747","7","Samantha Tyner","37085620747","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","25-30 Oct. 2015","Chicago, IL, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2015.7347659","160","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347659/","","","","","","","Measurement","","","","","","","7347613","978-1-4673-9783-4","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-9783-4","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347659","25-30 Oct. 2015","7337653","2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2015","IEEE","22","159","On the move at DinoFun world"

"We present a visual analytics tool, called Spectrum, to analyze the movement and communication log data from VAST Challenge 2015. Spectrum has two views: MoveView and SpectrumView. MoveView gives an overview of the movement logs at a certain timestamp by synthesizing time, location and identity information. It replays movement logs over time and demonstrates communication logs with dynamic links. SpectrumView shows the status of all visitors' activities within a period of time. Each stay of visitors in a location is visualized as a line segment. The duration and location type of the stay are encoded by the length and color of the segment. Accumulating segments of the same visitor horizontally and aligning sequences of segments from different visitors form a general view of all visitors' activities. In our attempt to solve the VAST Challenge 2015, we find that Spectrum provides an intuitive overview of the log data and helps to discover movement patterns from a large number of log records.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347667/","LOCKED","7347667","Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085578558","1","Junpeng Wang","37085578558","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085357671","2","Ji Wang","37085357671","Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37419565900","3","Chris North","37419565900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","0","25-30 Oct. 2015","Chicago, IL, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2015.7347667","176","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347667/","","","","","","","Visual analytics","Tracking","Sorting","Image color analysis","Electronic mail","Logic gates","","7347613","978-1-4673-9783-4","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-9783-4","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347667","25-30 Oct. 2015","7337653","2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2015","IEEE","25","175","Spectrum: A visual analytics tool to explore movement logs"
"Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) models simulate weather conditions by generating 2D numerical weather prediction ensemble members either through perturbing initial conditions or by changing different parameterization schemes, e.g., cumulus and microphysics schemes. These simulations are often used by weather analysts to analyze the nature of uncertainty attributed by these simulations to forecast weather conditions with good accuracy. The number of simulations used for forecasting is growing with the advent of increase in computing power. Hence, there is a need for providing better visual insights of uncertainty with growing number of ensemble members. We propose a geo visual analytical framework that uses visual analytics approach to resolve visual scalability of these ensemble members. Our approach naturally fits with the workflow of an analyst analyzing ensemble spatial uncertainty. Meteorologists evaluated our framework qualitatively and found it to be effective in acquiring insights of spatial uncertainty associated with multiple ensemble runs that are simulated using multiple parameterization schemes.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347671/","LOCKED","7347671","Mississippi State University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38578315200","1","Sujan Anreddy","38578315200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mississippi State University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37277708500","2","Song Zhang","37277708500","Mississippi State University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590976900","3","Andrew Mercer","37590976900","Mississippi State University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37408980300","4","Jamie Dyer","37408980300","Mississippi State University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38576023600","5","J.

"The 2015 VAST challenge features movement tracking (Mini- Challenge 1 (MC1)) and communication information (Mini- Challenge 2 (MC2)) datasets of all visitors in an amusement park over a three-day weekend. The data includes around 25 million individual movement records, along with 4 million communication records. Analyzing and exploring such large-scale datasets require intelligent data mining methods that characterize the overall trends and anomalies, as well as interactive visual interfaces to support investigation at different spatiotemporal granularities. The objective of MC1 was to characterize the behavior of different groups of visitors, compare different activity patterns over the three days, and discover anomalies or unusual behavior patterns that relate to the crime that occurred during the weekend. We utilized both movement data provided in MC1 and communication data provided in MC2 to answer the questions asked in MC1.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347669/","LOCKED","7347669","Purdue University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085454267","1","Jieqiong Zhao","37085454267","Purdue University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37397435000","11","Abish Malik","37397435000","Purdue University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37853300200","12","Sungahn Ko","37853300200","Purdue University, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282598900","13","David S.

"In streaming acquisitions the data changes over time. ThemeRiver and line charts are common methods to display data over time. However, these methods can only show the values of the variables (or attributes) but not the relationships among them over time. We propose a framework we call StreamVisND that can display these types of streaming data relations. It first slices the data stream into different time slices, then it visualizes each slice with a sequence of multivariate 2D data layouts, and finally it flattens this series of displays into a parallel coordinate type display. Our framework is fully interactive and lends itself well to real-time displays.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347673/","LOCKED","7347673","Visual Analytics and Imaging Lab, Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University and SUNY Korea","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085387617","1","Shenghui Cheng","37085387617","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Department of Computer Science, Shandong University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085678270","2","Yue Wang","37085678270","Visual Analytics and Imaging Lab, Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University and SUNY Korea","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085670294","3","Dan Zhang","37085670294","Department of Computer Science, Shandong University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37879862600","4","Zhifang Jiang","37879862600","Visual Analytics and Imaging Lab, Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University and SUNY Korea","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273119700","5","Klaus Mueller","37273119700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","25-30 Oct. 2015","Chicago, IL, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2015.7347673","192","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347673/","","","","","","","Data visualization","Layout","Streaming media","Pollution","Correlation","Silicon","Computer science","7347613","978-1-4673-9783-4","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-9783-4","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347673","25-30 Oct. 2015","7337653","2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2015","IEEE","28","191","StreamVisND: Visualizing relationships in streaming multivariate data"

"Topic model has been an active research area for many years, it can be used for discovering latent semantics and finding hidden knowledge in unstructured data corpus. In this paper, we investigated the problems in visualizing hierarchical topic and their evolution. The contribution of this paper is threefold, first we explore the static visualization of hierarchical topics using the `nested circle' layout, and then in order to present the topic evolution over time, we extended a hierarchical topic model and employ topic transformation visualizations to track the arising, splitting and disappearing of certain topics under the dynamic topical hierarchy. Finally, a Hierarchical Topic Model Visualization System (HTMVS) is designed to take advantage of both static and dynamic hierarchical topic visualization.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347675/","LOCKED","7347675","College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085671607","1","Haoling Dong","37085671607","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37953100600","2","Siliang Tang","37953100600","College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085668342","3","Si Li","37085668342","College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272891600","4","Fei Wu","37272891600","College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275441700","5","Yueting Zhuang","37275441700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","25-30 Oct. 2015","Chicago, IL, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2015.7347675","196","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347675/","Topic visualization","hierarchical topic visualization","topic evolution visualization","","","","Visualization","Computational modeling","Data visualization","Layout","Mathematical model","Markov processes","Yttrium","7347613","978-1-4673-9783-4","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-9783-4","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347675","25-30 Oct. 2015","7337653","2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2015","IEEE","30","195","HTMVS: Visualizing hierarchical topics and their evolution"

"There are often multiple routes between regions. Many factors potentially affect driver's route choice, such as expected time cost, length etc. In this work, we present a visual analysis system to explore driver's route choice behaviour based on taxi GPS trajectory data. With interactive trajectory filtering, the system constructs feasible routes between regions of interest. Using a rank-based visualization, the attributes of multiple routes are explored and compared. Based on a statistical model, the system supports to verify trajectory-related factors' impact on route choice behaviour. The effectiveness of the system is demonstrated by applying to real trajectory dataset.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347679/","LOCKED","7347679","Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38238228600","1","Min Lu","38238228600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085501991","2","Chufan Lai","37085501991","Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085582100","3","Tangzhi Ye","37085582100","Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085343774","4","Jie Liang","37085343774","Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403856700","5","Xiaoru Yuan","37403856700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5","0","25-30 Oct. 2015","Chicago, IL, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2015.7347679","204","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347679/","I.3.6 [Computer Graphics]: Methodology and Interaction Techniques-","H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: Graphical User Interfaces(GUI)-","","","","","Trajectory","Global Positioning System","Public transportation","Visual analytics","Roads","Vehicles","","7347613","978-1-4673-9783-4","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-9783-4","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347679","25-30 Oct. 2015","7337653","2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2015","IEEE","35","203","Visual analysis of route choice behaviour based on GPS trajectories"
"Visualization helps users infer structures and relationships in the data by encoding information as visual features that can be processed by the human visual-perceptual system. However, users would typically need to expend significant effort to scan and analyze a large number of views before they can begin to recognize relationships in a visualization. We propose a technique to partially automate the process of analyzing visualizations. By deriving and analyzing image-space features from visualizations, we can detect perceptually-separable patterns in the information space. We summarize these patterns with a tree-based meta-visualization and present it to the user to aid exploration. We illustrate this technique with an example scenario involving the analysis of census data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347683/","LOCKED","7347683","Argonne National Laboratory, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38581219900","1","Khairi Reda","38581219900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Hawai'i at Mānoa, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085760524","2","Alberto González","37085760524","University of Hawai'i at Mānoa, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284238900","3","Jason Leigh","37284238900","Argonne National Laboratory, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267817200","4","Michael E.

"Observational studies are a widely used and challenging class of studies. A key challenge is selecting a study cohort from the available data, or “pruning” the data, in a way that produces both sufficient balance in pre-treatment covariates and an easily described cohort from which results can be generalized. Even with advanced pruning methods, it is often difficult for researchers to see how the cohort is being selected; consequently, these methods are underutilized in research. Visual Pruner is a free, easy-to-use web application that can improve both the credibility and generalizability of observational studies by letting analysts use updatable visual displays of estimated propensity scores and key baseline covariates to refine inclusion criteria. By helping researchers see how covariate distributions in their data relate to the estimated probabilities of treatment assignment, the app lets researchers make pruning decisions based on pre-treatment covariate patterns that are otherwise hard to discover. The app yields a set of inclusion criteria that can be used in conjunction with further statistical analysis in any statistical software.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347685/","LOCKED","7347685","Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085663235","1","Lauren R.

We employ linked views to communicate different aspects of the data: the statistical distribution of molecule fitness, connections between individual molecules during the evolution and 3D molecular structure.

"Multi-level simulation models, i.e., models where different components are simulated using sub-models of varying levels of complexity, belong to the current state-of-the-art in simulation. The existing analysis practice for multi-level simulation results is to manually compare results from different levels of complexity, amounting to a very tedious and error-prone, trial-and-error exploration process. In this paper, we introduce hierarchical visual steering, a new approach to the exploration and design of complex systems. Hierarchical visual steering makes it possible to explore and analyze hierarchical simulation ensembles at different levels of complexity. At each level, we deal with a dynamic simulation ensemble - the ensemble grows during the exploration process. There is at least one such ensemble per simulation level, resulting in a collection of dynamic ensembles, analyzed simultaneously. The key challenge is to map the multi-dimensional parameter space of one ensemble to the multi-dimensional parameter space of another ensemble (from another level). In order to support the interactive visual analysis of such complex data we propose a novel approach to interactive and semi-automatic parameter space segmentation and comparison. The approach combines a novel interaction technique and automatic, computational methods - clustering, concave hull computation, and concave polygon overlapping - to support the analysts in the cross-ensemble parameter space mapping. In addition to the novel parameter space segmentation we also deploy coordinated multiple views with standard plots. We describe the abstract analysis tasks, identified during a case study, i.e., the design of a variable valve actuation system of a car engine. The study is conducted in cooperation with experts from the automotive industry. Very positive feedback indicates the usefulness and efficiency of the newly proposed approach.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347635/","LOCKED","7347635","VRVis Research Center in Vienna, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085338700","1","Rainer Splechtna","37085338700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","VRVis Research Center in Vienna, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37947312900","2","Krešimir Matković","37947312900","Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37323697500","3","Denis Gračanin","37323697500","AVL-AST Zagreb, Croatia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085338297","4","Mario Jelović","37085338297","University of Bergen, Norway","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274158800","5","Helwig Hauser","37274158800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7","0","25-30 Oct. 2015","Chicago, IL, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2015.7347635","96","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347635/","Interactive Visual Analysis","Simulation-Ensemble Steering","Multi-resolution simulation","","","","Analytical models","Computational modeling","Aerospace electronics","Visualization","Engines","Complex systems","Valves","7347613","978-1-4673-9783-4","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-9783-4","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347635","25-30 Oct. 2015","7337653","2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2015","IEEE","52","89","Interactive visual steering of hierarchical simulation ensembles"
"Machine learning requires an effective combination of data, features, and algorithms. While many tools exist for working with machine learning data and algorithms, support for thinking of new features, or feature ideation, remains poor. In this paper, we investigate two general approaches to support feature ideation: visual summaries and sets of errors. We present FeatureInsight, an interactive visual analytics tool for building new dictionary features (semantically related groups of words) for text classification problems. FeatureInsight supports an error-driven feature ideation process and provides interactive visual summaries of sets of misclassified documents. We conducted a controlled experiment evaluating both visual summaries and sets of errors in FeatureInsight. Our results show that visual summaries significantly improve feature ideation, especially in combination with sets of errors. Users preferred visual summaries over viewing raw data, and only preferred examining sets when visual summaries were provided. We discuss extensions of both approaches to data types other than text, and point to areas for future research.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347637/","LOCKED","7347637","University of Washington, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37664732500","1","Michael Brooks","37664732500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Microsoft Research, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085668601","2","Saleema Amershi","37085668601","Microsoft Research, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37293389400","3","Bongshin Lee","37293389400","Microsoft Research, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37585786500","4","Steven M.

"Visualizing time-varying data defined on the nodes of a graph is a challenging problem that has been faced with different approaches. Although techniques based on aggregation, topology, and topic modeling have proven their usefulness, the visual analysis of smooth and/or abrupt data variations as well as the evolution of such variations over time are aspects not properly tackled by existing methods. In this work we propose a novel visualization methodology that relies on graph wavelet theory and stacked graph metaphor to enable the visual analysis of time-varying data defined on the nodes of a graph. The proposed method is able to identify regions where data presents abrupt and mild spacial and/or temporal variation while still been able to show how such changes evolve over time, making the identification of events an easier task. The usefulness of our approach is shown through a set of results using synthetic as well as a real data set involving taxi trips in downtown Manhattan.

"The Epidemic Simulation System (EpiSimS) is a scalable, complex modeling tool for analyzing disease within the United States. Due to its high input dimensionality, time requirements, and resource constraints, simulating over the entire parameter space is unfeasible. One solution is to take a granular sampling of the input space and use simpler predictive models (emulators) in between. The quality of the implemented emulator depends on many factors: robustness, sophistication, configuration, and suitability to the input data. Visual analytics can be leveraged to provide guidance and understanding of these things to the user. In this paper, we have implemented a novel interface and workflow for emulator building and use. We introduce a workflow to build emulators, make predictions, and then analyze the results. Our prediction process first predicts temporal time series, and uses these to derive predicted spatial densities. Integrated into the EpiSimS framework, we target users who are non-experts at statistical modeling. This approach allows for a high level of analysis into the state of the built emulators and their resultant predictions. We present our workflow, models, the associated system, and evaluate the overall utility with feedback from EpiSimS scientists.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347626/","LOCKED","7347626","VIDi @ U.C.

"Using transport smart card transaction data to understand the homework dynamics of a city for urban planning is emerging as an alternative to traditional surveys which may be conducted every few years are no longer effective and efficient for the rapidly transforming modern cities. As commuters travel patterns are highly diverse, existing rule-based methods are not fully adequate. In this paper, we present iVizTRANS - a tool which combines an interactive visual analytics (VA) component to aid urban planners to analyse complex travel patterns and decipher activity locations for single public transport commuters. It is coupled with a machine learning component that iteratively learns from the planners classifications to train a classifier. The classifier is then applied to the city-wide smart card data to derive the dynamics for all public transport commuters. Our evaluation shows it outperforms the rule-based methods in previous work.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347630/","LOCKED","7347630","Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085671750","1","Liang Yu","37085671750","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38066979600","2","Wei Wu","38066979600","Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085739394","3","Xiaohui Li","37085739394","Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085727868","4","Guangxia Li","37085727868","Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38192950700","5","Wee Siong Ng","38192950700","Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271680100","6","See-Kiong Ng","37271680100","Urban Redevelopment Authority, Singapore","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085733259","7","Zhongwen Huang","37085733259","Urban Redevelopment Authority, Singapore","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085732289","8","Anushiya Arunan","37085732289","Urban Redevelopment Authority, Singapore","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085727765","9","Hui Min Watt","37085727765","","","","","","3","0","25-30 Oct. 2015","Chicago, IL, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2015.7347630","56","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347630/","Smart card data","origin-destination (OD)","spatiotemporal visualization","clustering","machine learning","","Data visualization","Smart cards","Feature extraction","Cities and towns","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Visualization","Clustering algorithms","7347613","978-1-4673-9783-4","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-9783-4","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347630","25-30 Oct. 2015","7337653","2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2015","IEEE","56","49","iVizTRANS: Interactive visual learning for home and work place detection from massive public transportation data"
"The current proliferation of large displays and mobile devices presents a number of exciting opportunities for visual analytics and information visualization. The display ecology enables multiple displays to function in concert within a broader technological environment to accomplish visual analysis tasks. Based on a comprehensive survey of multi-display systems from a variety of fields, we propose four key considerations for visual analysis in display ecologies: 1) Display Composition, 2) Information Coordination/Transfer, 3) Information Connection, and 4) Display Membership. Different aspects of display ecologies stemming from these design considerations will enable users to transform and empower multiple displays as a display ecology for visual analysis.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347628/","LOCKED","7347628","University of Alabama Huntsville, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085626824","1","Haeyong Chung","37085626824","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Virginia Tech, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37419565900","2","Chris North","37419565900","Virginia Tech, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085622883","3","Sarang Joshi","37085622883","University of Maryland Baltimore County, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087515157","4","Jian Chen","37087515157","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6","0","25-30 Oct. 2015","Chicago, IL, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2015.7347628","40","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347628/","","","","","","","Ecology","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Collaboration","Human computer interaction","Encoding","","7347613","978-1-4673-9783-4","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-9783-4","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347628","25-30 Oct. 2015","7337653","2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2015","IEEE","57","33","Four considerations for supporting visual analysis in display ecologies"
"Event-based egocentric dynamic networks are an important class of networks widely seen in many domains. In this paper, we present a visual analytics approach for these networks by combining data-driven network simplifications with a novel visualization design - EgoNetCloud. In particular, an integrated data processing pipeline is proposed to prune, compress and filter the networks into smaller but salient abstractions. To accommodate the simplified network into the visual design, we introduce a constrained graph layout algorithm on the dynamic network. Through a real-life case study as well as conversations with the domain expert, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the EgoNetCloud design and system in completing analysis tasks on event-based dynamic networks. The user study comparing EgoNetCloud with a working system on academic search confirms the effectiveness and convenience of our visual analytics based approach.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347632/","LOCKED","7347632","SKLCS, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085692999","1","Qingsong Liu","37085692999","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yahoo Labs, New York, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085696465","2","Yifan Hu","37085696465","SKLCS, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085394737","3","Lei Shi","37085394737","Academy of Art and Design, Tsinghua University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085665211","4","Xinzhu Mu","37085665211","Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085682188","5","Yutao Zhang","37085682188","Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085685270","6","Jie Tang","37085685270","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","0","25-30 Oct. 2015","Chicago, IL, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2015.7347632","72","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347632/","","","","","","","Visualization","Layout","Heuristic algorithms","Data visualization","Collaboration","Stress","Clutter","7347613","978-1-4673-9783-4","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-9783-4","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347632","25-30 Oct. 2015","7337653","2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2015","IEEE","58","65","EgoNetCloud: Event-based egocentric dynamic network visualization"
"We present a new visual analysis approach to support the comparative exploration of 2D vector-valued ensemble fields. Our approach enables the user to quickly identify the most similar groups of ensemble members, as well as the locations where the variation among the members is high. We further provide means to visualize the main features of the potentially multimodal directional distributions at user-selected locations. For this purpose, directional data is modelled using mixtures of probability density functions (pdfs), which allows us to characterize and classify complex distributions with relatively few parameters. The resulting mixture models are used to determine the degree of similarity between ensemble members, and to construct glyphs showing the direction, spread, and strength of the principal modes of the directional distributions. We also propose several similarity measures, based on which we compute pairwise member similarities in the spatial domain and form clusters of similar members. The hierarchical clustering is shown using dendrograms and similarity matrices, which can be used to select particular members and visualize their variations. A user interface providing multiple linked views enables the simultaneous visualization of aggregated global and detailed local variations, as well as the selection of members for a detailed comparison.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347634/","LOCKED","7347634","Technische Universität München, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085704850","1","Mihaela Jarema","37085704850","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Technische Universität München, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085574383","2","Ismail Demir","37085574383","Technische Universität München, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546620000","3","Johannes Kehrer","37546620000","Technische Universität München, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37444424000","4","Rüdiger Westermann","37444424000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","16","0","25-30 Oct. 2015","Chicago, IL, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2015.7347634","88","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347634/","Uncertainty Visualization","Vector Field Data","Coordinated and Multiple Views","Glyph-based Techniques","","","Data visualization","Data models","Visualization","Computational modeling","Uncertainty","Wind","","7347613","978-1-4673-9783-4","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-9783-4","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347634","25-30 Oct. 2015","7337653","2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2015","IEEE","59","81","Comparative visual analysis of vector field ensembles"
"Architects working with developers and city planners typically rely on experience, precedent and data analyzed in isolation when making decisions that impact the character of a city. These decisions are critical in enabling vibrant, sustainable environments but must also negotiate a range of complex political and social forces. This requires those shaping the built environment to balance maximizing the value of a new development with its impact on the character of a neighborhood. As a result architects are focused on two issues throughout the decision making process: a) what defines the character of a neighborhood? and b) how will a new development change its neighborhood? In the first, character can be influenced by a variety of factors and understanding the interplay between diverse data sets is crucial; including safety, transportation access, school quality and access to entertainment. In the second, the impact of a new development is measured, for example, by how it impacts the view from the buildings that surround it. In this paper, we work in collaboration with architects to design Urbane, a 3-dimensional multi-resolution framework that enables a data-driven approach for decision making in the design of new urban development. This is accomplished by integrating multiple data layers and impact analysis techniques facilitating architects to explore and assess the effect of these attributes on the character and value of a neighborhood. Several of these data layers, as well as impact analysis, involve working in 3-dimensions and operating in real time. Efficient computation and visualization is accomplished through the use of techniques from computer graphics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Urbane through a case study of development in Manhattan depicting how a data-driven understanding of the value and impact of speculative buildings can benefit the design-development process between architects, planners and developers.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347636/","LOCKED","7347636","New York University, USA","","1","Nivan Ferreira","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Universidade Federal Fluminense, Brazil","","2","Marcos Lage","","New York University, USA","","3","Harish Doraiswamy","","New York University, USA","","4","Huy Vo","","Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates PC, USA","","5","Luc Wilson","","Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates PC, USA","","6","Heidi Werner","","Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates PC, USA","","7","Muchan Park","","New York University, USA","","8","Cláudio Silva","","","","","","","","","","","","12","0","25-30 Oct. 2015","Chicago, IL, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2015.7347636","104","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347636/","Urban data analysis","GIS","impact analysis","visual analytics","architecture","city development","Buildings","Cities and towns","Three-dimensional displays","Data visualization","Decision making","Visualization","Stakeholders","7347613","978-1-4673-9783-4","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-9783-4","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347636","25-30 Oct. 2015","7337653","2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2015","IEEE","60","97","Urbane: A 3D framework to support data driven decision making in urban development"
"A fictitious amusement park and a larger-than-life hometown football hero provided participants in the VAST Challenge 2015 with an engaging yet complex storyline and setting in which to analyze movement and communication patterns. The datasets for the 2015 challenge were large—averaging nearly 10 million records per day over a three day period—with a simple straightforward structured format. The simplicity of the format belied a complex wealth of features contained in the data that needed to be discovered and understood to solve the tasks and questions that were posed. Two Mini-Challenges and a Grand Challenge compose the 2015 competition. Mini-Challenge 1 contained structured location and date-time data for park visitors, against which participants were to discern groups and their activities. Mini-Challenge 2 contained structured communication data consisting of metadata about time-stamped text messages sent between park visitors. The Grand Challenge required participants to use both movement and communication data to hypothesize when a crime was committed and identify the most likely suspects from all the park visitors. The VAST Challenge 2015 received 71 submissions, and the datasets were downloaded, at least partially, from 26 countries.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347638/","LOCKED","7347638","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37357067600","1","Mark Whiting","37357067600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085505404","2","Kristin Cook","37085505404","University of Massachusetts-Lowell, MA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37360588500","3","Georges Grinstein","37360588500","University of Massachusetts-Lowell, MA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085522319","4","John Fallon","37085522319","Air Force Research Laboratory, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085508309","5","Kristen Liggett","37085508309","MIT Lincoln Laboratory, MA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085713208","6","Diane Staheli","37085713208","Smith College, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085718680","7","Jordan Crouser","37085718680","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4","0","25-30 Oct. 2015","Chicago, IL, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2015.7347638","118","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347638/","Visual Analytics","Human Information Interaction","Sense Making","Movement Analysis","Evaluation","Contest","Games","Electronic mail","Visual analytics","Software","Engineering profession","Layout","Videos","7347613","978-1-4673-9783-4","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-9783-4","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347638","25-30 Oct. 2015","7337653","2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2015","IEEE","61","113","VAST Challenge 2015: Mayhem at dinofun world"
"Visual data analysis is composed of a collection of cognitive actions and tasks to decompose, internalize, and recombine data to produce knowledge and insight. Visual analytic tools provide interactive visual interfaces to data to support discovery and sensemaking tasks, including forming hypotheses, asking questions, and evaluating and organizing evidence. Myriad analytic models can be incorporated into visual analytic systems at the cost of increasing complexity in the analytic discourse between user and system. Techniques exist to increase the usability of interacting with analytic models, such as inferring data models from user interactions to steer the underlying models of the system via semantic interaction, shielding users from having to do so explicitly. Such approaches are often also referred to as mixed-initiative systems. Sensemaking researchers have called for development of tools that facilitate analytic sensemaking through a combination of human and automated activities. However, design guidelines do not exist for mixed-initiative visual analytic systems to support iterative sensemaking. In this paper, we present candidate design guidelines and introduce the Active Data Environment (ADE) prototype, a spatial workspace supporting the analytic process via task recommendations invoked by inferences about user interactions within the workspace. ADE recommends data and relationships based on a task model, enabling users to co-reason with the system about their data in a single, spatial workspace. This paper provides an illustrative use case, a technical description of ADE, and a discussion of the strengths and limitations of the approach.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347625/","LOCKED","7347625","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085505404","1","Kristin Cook","37085505404","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37941944900","2","Nick Cramer","37941944900","SRI International, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073586200","3","David Israel","37073586200","SRI International, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37265951300","4","Michael Wolverton","37265951300","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37686679000","5","Joe Bruce","37686679000","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085671815","6","Russ Burtner","37085671815","Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37681759500","7","Alex Endert","37681759500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12","0","25-30 Oct. 2015","Chicago, IL, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2015.7347625","16","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347625/","mixed-initiative visual analytics","task modeling","recommender systems","sensemaking","","","Visual analytics","Data models","Analytical models","Data visualization","Computational modeling","","","7347613","978-1-4673-9783-4","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-9783-4","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347625","25-30 Oct. 2015","7337653","2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2015","IEEE","62","9","Mixed-initiative visual analytics using task-driven recommendations"
"Consider the emerging role of data science teams embedded in larger organizations. Individual analysts work on loosely related problems, and must share their findings with each other and the organization at large, moving results from exploratory data analyses (EDA) into automated visualizations, diagnostics and reports deployed for wider consumption. There are two problems with the current practice. First, there are gaps in this workflow: EDA is performed with one set of tools, and automated reports and deployments with another. Second, these environments often assume a single-developer perspective, while data scientist teams could get much benefit from easier sharing of scripts and data feeds, experiments, annotations, and automated recommendations, which are well beyond what traditional version control systems provide. We contribute and justify the following three requirements for systems built to support current data science teams and users: discoverability, technology transfer, and coexistence. In addition, we contribute the design and implementation of RCloud, a system that supports the requirements of collaborative data analysis, visualization and web deployment. About 100 people used RCloud for two years. We report on interviews with some of these users, and discuss design decisions, tradeoffs and limitations in comparison to other approaches.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347627/","LOCKED","7347627","Infovisible, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37372818600","1","Stephen North","37372818600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Arizona, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550809300","2","Carlos Scheidegger","37550809300","AT&T Labs, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37703730700","3","Simon Urbanek","37703730700","AT&T Labs, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085734124","4","Gordon Woodhull","37085734124","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2","0","25-30 Oct. 2015","Chicago, IL, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2015.7347627","32","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347627/","visual analytics process","provenance","collaboration","visualization","computer-supported cooperative work","","Data visualization","Data analysis","Visual analytics","Production","Collaboration","Organizations","Electronic mail","7347613","978-1-4673-9783-4","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-9783-4","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347627","25-30 Oct. 2015","7337653","2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2015","IEEE","63","25","Collaborative visual analysis with RCloud"
"The wide-spread of social media provides unprecedented sources of written language that can be used to model and infer online demographics. In this paper, we introduce a novel visual text analytics system, DemographicVis, to aid interactive analysis of such demographic information based on user-generated content. Our approach connects categorical data (demographic information) with textual data, allowing users to understand the characteristics of different demographic groups in a transparent and exploratory manner. The modeling and visualization are based on ground truth demographic information collected via a survey conducted on Reddit.com. Detailed user information is taken into our modeling process that connects the demographic groups with features that best describe the distinguishing characteristics of each group. Features including topical and linguistic are generated from the user-generated contents. Such features are then analyzed and ranked based on their ability to predict the users' demographic information. To enable interactive demographic analysis, we introduce a web-based visual interface that presents the relationship of the demographic groups, their topic interests, as well as the predictive power of various features. We present multiple case studies to showcase the utility of our visual analytics approach in exploring and understanding the interests of different demographic groups. We also report results from a comparative evaluation, showing that the DemographicVis is quantitatively superior or competitive and subjectively preferred when compared to a commercial text analysis tool.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347631/","LOCKED","7347631","UNC Charlotte, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606064200","1","Wenwen Dou","37606064200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","UNC Charlotte, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38236879300","2","Isaac Cho","38236879300","UNC Charlotte, USA","","3","Omar ElTayeby","","Korea University, South Korea","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37602784600","4","Jaegul Choo","37602784600","Taste Analytics, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085714260","5","Xiaoyu Wang","37085714260","UNC Charlotte, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300425000","6","William Ribarsky","37300425000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8","2","25-30 Oct. 2015","Chicago, IL, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2015.7347631","64","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347631/","Visual Text Analysis","User Interface","Social Media","Demographic Analysis","","","Feature extraction","User-generated content","Pragmatics","Media","Visual analytics","Data mining","","7347613","978-1-4673-9783-4","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-9783-4","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347631","25-30 Oct. 2015","7337653","2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2015","IEEE","64","57","DemographicVis: Analyzing demographic information based on user generated content"
"Recognizing activities has become increasingly relevant in many application domains, such as security or ambient assisted living. To handle different scenarios, the underlying automated algorithms are configured using multiple input parameters. However, the influence and interplay of these parameters is often not clear, making exhaustive evaluations necessary. On this account, we propose a visual analytics approach to supporting users in understanding the complex relationships among parameters, recognized activities, and associated accuracies. First, representative parameter settings are determined. Then, the respective output is computed and statistically analyzed to assess parameters' influence in general. Finally, visualizing the parameter settings along with the activities provides overview and allows to investigate the computed results in detail. Coordinated interaction helps to explore dependencies, compare different settings, and examine individual activities. By integrating automated, visual, and interactive means users can select parameter values that meet desired quality criteria. We demonstrate the application of our solution in a use case with realistic complexity, involving a study of human protagonists in daily living with respect to hundreds of parameter settings.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347629/","LOCKED","7347629","University of Rostock, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085387746","1","Martin Röhlig","37085387746","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Rostock, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869995900","2","Martin Luboschik","37869995900","University of Rostock, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38243613200","3","Frank Krüger","38243613200","University of Rostock, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37427741700","4","Thomas Kirste","37427741700","University of Rostock, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283240400","5","Heidrun Schumann","37283240400","Vienna University of Technology, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077691500","6","Markus Bögl","37077691500","Vienna University of Technology, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38242873200","7","Bilal Alsallakh","38242873200","Vienna University of Technology, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282584500","8","Silvia Miksch","37282584500","","","","","","","","","","","6","0","25-30 Oct. 2015","Chicago, IL, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2015.7347629","48","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347629/","I.3.6 [Computing Methodologies]: Computer Graphics—Methodology and Techniques","H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: User Interfaces—Theory and methods","","","","","Time series analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Statistical analysis","Visual analytics","Data visualization","Prediction algorithms","","7347613","978-1-4673-9783-4","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-9783-4","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347629","25-30 Oct. 2015","7337653","2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2015","IEEE","65","41","Supporting activity recognition by visual analytics"
"The rate at which frames are rendered in a computer game directly influences both game playability and enjoyability. Players frequently have to deal with the trade-off between high frame rates and good resolution. Analyzing patterns in frame rate data and their correlation with the overall game performance is important in designing games (e.g., graphic card/display setting suggestion and game performance measurement). However, this task is challenging because game frame rates vary both temporally and spatially. In addition, players may adjust their display settings based on their gaming experience and hardware conditions, which further contributes to the unpredictability of frame rates. In this paper, we present a comprehensive visual analytics system FPSSeer, to help game designers gain insight into frame rate data. Our system consists of four major views: 1) a frame rate view to show the overall distribution in a geographic scale, 2) a grid view to show the frame rate distribution and grid element clusters based on their similarity, 3) a FootRiver view to reveal the temporal patterns in game condition changes and potential spatiotemporal correlations, and 4) a comparison view to evaluate game performance discrepancy under different game tests. The real-world case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our system. The system has been applied to an online commercial game to monitor its performance and to provide feedbacks to designers and developers.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347633/","LOCKED","7347633","NetEase Games, NetEase, Inc., Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085720737","1","Quan Li","37085720737","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","NetEase Games, NetEase, Inc., China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085721107","2","Peng Xu","37085721107","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","3","Huamin Qu","37272637300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","25-30 Oct. 2015","Chicago, IL, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2015.7347633","80","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347633/","frame rate data","game performance evaluation","visual analytics","","","","Games","Data visualization","Hardware","Visual analytics","Computers","Correlation","","7347613","978-1-4673-9783-4","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-9783-4","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347633","25-30 Oct. 2015","7337653","2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2015","IEEE","66","73","FPSSeer: Visual analysis of game frame rate data"

"The IEEE Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST) Conference is now in its tenth year, and its sixth year as an IEEE Conference. It remains the primary venue for the rapidly growing field of visual analytics. Visual analytics is the science of analytical reasoning supported by highly interactive visual interfaces, and seeks to integrate computational analytics with human cognitive processes. Visual analytics requires interdisciplinary science, going beyond traditional visualization to include statistics, mathematics, knowledge representation, management and discovery technologies, cognitive and perceptual sciences, decision sciences, and more.","","EPHEMERA","7347617","Fraunhofer IAIS and City University London, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047100","1","Gennady Andrienko","37283047100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Oxford University, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085654077","2","Min Chen","37085654077","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","25-30 Oct. 2015","Chicago, IL, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2015.7347617","1","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347617/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7347613","978-1-4673-9783-4","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4673-9783-4","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7347617","25-30 Oct. 2015","7337653","2015 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2015","IEEE","76","1","Preface"
