"For most of the time, we enjoy and appreciate music performances as they are. Once we try to understand the performance not in subjective terms but in an objective way and share it with other people, visualizing the performance parameters is indispensable. In this paper, a figure for visualizing performance expressions is described. This figure helps people understand the cause and position of the performance expression as it has expressive cues, which coincide with the cognitive meaning of musical performance, and not by using only MIDI parameter values. The differences we hear between performances are clarified by visualized figures.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183815/","LOCKED","1183815","Bunkyo Univ., Japan","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37597820500","1","R.

"We have created an application, called PRIMA (Patient Record intelligent Monitoring and Analysis), which can be used to visualize and understand patient record data. It was developed to better understand a large collection of patient records of bone marrow transplants at Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, Israel. It is based on an information visualization toolkit, Opal, which has been developed at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center. Opal allows intelligent, interactive visualization of a wide variety of different types of data. The PRIMA application is generally applicable to a wide range of patient record data, as the underlying toolkit is flexible with regard to the form of the input data. This application is a good example of the usefulness of information visualization techniques in the bioinformatics domain, as these techniques have been developed specifically to deal with diverse sets of often unfamiliar data. We illustrate several unanticipated findings which resulted from the use of a flexible and interactive information visualization environment.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183817/","LOCKED","1183817","IBM Thomas J.

"In this case study, we explore techniques for the purpose of visualizing isolated flow structures in time-dependent data. Our primary industrial application is the visualization of the vortex rope, a rotating helical structure which builds up in the draft tube of a water turbine. The vortex rope can be characterized by high values of normalized helicity, which is a scalar field derived from the given CFD velocity data. In two related applications, the goal is to visualize the cavitation regions near the runner blades of a Kaplan turbine and a water pump, respectively. Again, the flow structure of interest can be defined by a scalar field, namely by low pressure values. We propose a particle seeding scheme based on quasi-random numbers, which minimizes visual artifacts such as clusters or patterns. By constraining the visualization to a region of interest, occlusion problems are reduced and storage efficiency is gained.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183821/","LOCKED","1183821","Dept. of Comput.

"We present an innovative application developed at Sandia National Laboratories for visual debugging of unstructured finite element physics codes. Our tool automatically locates anomalous regions, such as inverted elements or nodes whose variable values lie outside a prescribed range, then extracts mesh subsets around these features for detailed examination. The subsets are viewed using color coding of variable values superimposed on the mesh structure. This allows the values and their relative spatial locations within the mesh to be correlated at a glance. Both topological irregularities and hot spots within the data stand out visually, allowing the user to explore the exact numeric values of the grid at surrounding points over time. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by debugging a cell inversion in a simulation of an exploding wire.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183819/","LOCKED","1183819","Sandia Nat.

"This paper examines a series of NASA outreach visualizations created using several layers of remote sensing satellite data ranging from 4-kilometers per pixel to I-meter per pixel. The viewer is taken on a seamless, cloud free journey from a global view of the Earth down to ground level where buildings, streets, and cars are visible. The visualizations were produced using a procedural shader that takes advantage of accurate georegistration and color matching between images. The shader accurately and efficiently maps the data sets to geometry allowing for animations with few perceptual transitions among data sets. We developed a pipeline to facilitate the production of over twenty zoom visualizations. Millions of people have seen these visualizations through national and international media coverage.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183825/","LOCKED","1183825","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283251400","1","G.W.

"This paper is a documentation of techniques invented, results obtained and lessons learned while creating visualization algorithms to render outputs of large-scale seismic simulations. The objective is the development of techniques for a collaborative simulation and visualization shared between structural engineers, seismologists, and computer scientists. The computer graphics research community has been witnessing a large number of exemplary publications addressing the challenges faced while trying to visualize both large-scale surface and volumetric datasets lately. From a visualization perspective, issues like data preprocessing (simplification, sampling, filtering, etc.); rendering algorithms (surface and volume), and interaction paradigms (large-scale, highly interactive, highly immersive, etc.) have been areas of study. In this light, we outline and describe the milestones achieved in a large-scale simulation and visualization project, which opened the scope for combining existing techniques with new methods, especially in those cases where no existing methods were suitable. We elucidate the data simplification and reorganization schemes that we used, and discuss the problems we encountered and the solutions we found. We describe both desktop (high-end local as well as remote) interfaces and immersive visualization systems that we developed to employ interactive surface and volume rendering algorithms. Finally, we describe the results obtained, challenges that still need to be addressed, and ongoing efforts to meet the challenges of large-scale visualization.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183814/","LOCKED","1183814","Eng.

"Internet connectivity is defined by a set of routing protocols which let the routers that comprise the Internet backbone choose the best route for a packet to reach its destination. One way to improve the security and performance of Internet is to routinely examine the routing data. In this case study, we show how interactive visualization of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) data helps characterize routing behavior, identify weaknesses in connectivity which could potentially cripple the Internet, as well as detect and explain actual anomalous events.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183816/","LOCKED","1183816","Dept. of Comput.

"Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is a popular computational simulation technique used in various scientific and engineering fields. Although AMR data is organized in a hierarchical multi-resolution data structure, the traditional volume visualization algorithms such as ray-casting and splatting cannot handle the form without converting it to a sophisticated data structure. In this paper, we present a hierarchical multi-resolution splatting technique using k-d trees and octrees for AMR data that is suitable for implementation on the latest consumer PC graphics hardware. We describe a graphical user interface to set transfer function and viewing/rendering parameters interactively. Experimental results obtained on a general purpose PC equipped with NVIDIA GeForce card are presented to demonstrate that the technique can interactively render AMR data (over 20 frames per second). Our scheme can easily be applied to parallel rendering of time-varying AMR data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183820/","LOCKED","1183820","Texas Univ., Austin, TX, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37441461200","1","Sanghun Park","37441461200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282899200","2","C.L.

"For quantitative examination of phenomena that simultaneously occur on very different spatial and temporal scales, adaptive hierarchical schemes are required. A special numerical multilevel technique, associated with a particular hierarchical data structure, is so-called adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). It allows one to bridge a wide range of spatial and temporal resolutions and therefore gains increasing popularity. We describe the interplay of several visualization and VR software packages for rendering time dependent AMR simulations of the evolution of the first star in the universe. The work was done in the framework of a television production for Discovery Channel television, ""The Unfolding Universe."". Parts of the data were taken from one of the most complex AMR simulation ever carried out: It contained up to 27 levels of resolution, requiring modifications to the texture based AMR volume rendering algorithm that was used to depict the density distribution of the gaseous interstellar matter. A voice and gesture controlled CAVE application was utilized to define camera paths following the interesting features deep inside the computational domains. Background images created from cosmological computational data were combined with the final renderings.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183824/","LOCKED","1183824","Zuse Inst., Berlin, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282637000","1","R.

"The Gauss map projects surface normals to a unit sphere, providing a powerful visualization of the geometry of a graphical object. it can be used to predict visual events caused by changes in lighting, shading, and camera control. We present an interactive technique for portraying the Gauss map of polygonal models, mapping surface normals and the magnitudes of surface curvature using a spherical projection. Unlike other visualizations of surface curvature, we create our Gauss map directly from polygonal meshes without requiring any complex intermediate calculations of differential geometry. For anything other than simple shapes, surface information is densely mapped into the Gaussian normal image, inviting the use of visualization techniques to amplify and emphasize details hidden within the wealth of data.

"Data sets from large-scale simulations (up to 501/sup 3/ grid points) of mantle convection are analyzed with volume rendering of the temperature field and a new critical point analysis of the velocity field. As the Rayleigh number Ra is increased the thermal field develops increasingly thin plume-like structures along which heat is convected. These eventually break down and become turbulent. Visualization methods are used to distinguish between various models of heat conductivity and to develop an intuitive understanding of the structure of the flow.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183813/","LOCKED","1183813","Sch. of Computational Sci. & Inf.

"We propose the use of textured splats as the basic display primitives for an open surface fire model. The high-detail textures help to achieve a smooth boundary of the fire and gain the small-scale turbulence appearance. We utilize the Lattice Boltzmann Model (LBM) to simulate physically-based equations describing the fire evolution and its interaction with the environment (e.g., obstacles, wind and temperature). The property of fuel and non-burning objects are defined on the lattice of the computation domain. A temperature field is also incorporated to model the generation of smoke from the fire due to incomplete combustion. The linear and local characteristics of the LBM enable us to accelerate the computation with graphics hardware to reach real-time simulation speed, while the texture splat primitives enable interactive rendering frame rates.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183779/","LOCKED","1183779","Dept. of Comput.

"Level-of-detail rendering is essential for rendering very large, detailed worlds in real-time. Unfortunately, level-of-detail computations can be expensive, creating a bottleneck at the CPU. This paper presents the CABTT algorithm, an extension to existing binary-triangle-tree-based level-of-detail algorithms. Instead of manipulating triangles, the CABTT algorithm instead operates on clusters of geometry called aggregate triangles. This reduces CPU overhead, eliminating a bottleneck common to level-of-detail algorithms. Since aggregate triangles stay fixed over several frames, they may be cached on the video card. This further reduces CPU load and fully utilizes the hardware accelerated rendering pipeline on modern video cards. These improvements result in a fourfold increase in frame rate over ROAM at high detail levels. Our implementation renders an approximation of an 8 million triangle height field at 42 frames per second with an maximum error of 1 pixel on consumer hardware.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183783/","LOCKED","1183783","California Univ., Berkeley, CA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38149622100","1","J.

"Finding the ""best"" viewing parameters for a scene is a difficult but very important problem. Fully automatic procedures seem to be impossible as the notion of ""best"" strongly depends on human judgment as well as on the application. In this paper a solution to the sub-problem of placing light sources for given camera parameters is proposed. A light position is defined to be optimal, when the resulting illumination reveals more about the scene than illuminations from all other light positions, i.e. the light position maximizes information that is added to the image through the illumination. With the help of an experiment with several subjects we could adapt the information measure to the actually perceived information content. We present fast global optimization procedures and solutions for two and more light sources.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183785/","LOCKED","1183785","WSI/GRIS, Tubingen Univ., Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37565742800","1","S.

"Surface texturing aids the visualization of polygonal meshes by providing additional surface orientation cues and feature annotations. Such texturing is usually implemented via texture mapping, which is easier and more effective when the distortion of the mapping from the surface to the texture map is kept small. We have previously shown that distortion occurs when areas of high surface curvature are flattened into the texture map. By cutting the surface in these areas one can reduce texture map distortion at the expense of additional seam artifacts. This paper describes a faster technique for guiding a texture map seam through high distortion regions, while restricting the seam to regions of low visibility. This results in distortion reducing seams that are less visually distracting and take less time to compute. We have also observed that visibility considerations improve the speed of a recent method that adds cuts to reduce a surface genus.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183787/","LOCKED","1183787","Dept. of Comput.

"The current state of the art in visualization research places strong emphasis on different techniques to derive insight from disparate types of data. However, little work has investigated the visualization process itself. The information content of the visualization process - the results, history, and relationships between those results - is addressed by this work. A characterization of the visualization process is discussed, leading to a general model of the visualization exploration process. The model, based upon a new parameter derivation calculus, can be used for automated reporting, analysis, or visualized directly. An XML-based language for expressing visualization sessions using the model is also described. These sessions can then be shared and reused by collaborators. The model, along with the XML representation, provides an effective means to utilize information within the visualization process to further data exploration.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183791/","LOCKED","1183791","Comput.

Without a formal definition, existing detection algorithms lack the ability to accurately identify these features, and the current method for verifying the accuracy of their results is by human visual inspection. Our verification algorithm addresses this issue by automating the visual inspection process. It is based on identifying the swirling streamlines that surround the candidate vortex cores. We apply our algorithm to both numerically simulated and procedurally generated datasets to illustrate the efficacy of our approach.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183789/","LOCKED","1183789","Ohio State Univ., Columbus, OH, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37826582200","1","Ming Jiang","37826582200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ohio State Univ., Columbus, OH, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37269516700","2","R.

"This paper presents a vision-based geometric alignment system for aligning the projectors in an arbitrarily large display wall. Existing algorithms typically rely on a single camera view and degrade in accuracy as the display resolution exceeds the camera resolution by several orders of magnitude. Naive approaches to integrating multiple zoomed camera views fail since small errors in aligning adjacent views propagate quickly over the display surface to create glaring discontinuities. Our algorithm builds and refines a camera homography tree to automatically register any number of uncalibrated camera images; the resulting system is both faster and significantly more accurate than competing approaches, reliably achieving alignment errors of 0.55 pixels on a 24-projector display in under 9 minutes. Detailed experiments compare our system to two recent display wall alignment algorithms, both on our 18 Megapixel display wall and in simulation. These results indicate that our approach achieves sub-pixel accuracy even on displays with hundreds of projectors.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183793/","LOCKED","1183793","Comput.

"In this paper we are presenting a novel approach for rendering large datasets in a view-dependent manner. In a typical view-dependent rendering framework, an appropriate level of detail is selected and sent to the graphics hardware for rendering at each frame. In our approach, we have successfully managed to speed up the selection of the level of detail as well as the rendering of the selected levels. We have accelerated the selection of the appropriate level of detail by not scanning active nodes that do not contribute to the incremental update of the selected level of detail. Our idea is based on imposing a spatial subdivision over the view-dependence trees data-structure, which allows spatial tree cells to refine and merge in real-time rendering to comply with the changes in the active nodes list. The rendering of the selected level of detail is accelerated by using vertex arrays. To overcome the dynamic changes in the selected levels of detail we use multiple small vertex arrays whose sizes depend on the memory on the graphics hardware. These multiple vertex arrays are attached to the active cells of the spatial tree and represent the active nodes of these cells. These vertex arrays, which are sent to the graphics hardware at each frame, merge and split with respect to the changes in the cells of the spatial tree.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183760/","LOCKED","1183760","Dept. of Comput.

"Visualization is required for the effective utilization of data from a weather simulation. Appropriate mapping of user goals to the design of pictorial content has been useful in the development of interactive applications with sufficient bandwidth for timely access to the model data. When remote access to the model visualizations is required the limited bandwidth becomes the primary bottleneck. To help address these problems, visualizations are presented on a Web page as a meta-representation of the model output and serve as an index to simplify finding other visualizations of relevance. To provide consistency with extant interactive products and to leverage their cost of development, the aforementioned applications are adapted to automatically populate a Web site with images and interactions for an operational weather forecasting system.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183827/","LOCKED","1183827","IBM Thomas J.

"Many computer graphics operations, such as texture mapping, 3D painting, remeshing, mesh compression, and digital geometry processing, require finding a low-distortion parameterization for irregular connectivity triangulations of arbitrary genus 2-manifolds. This paper presents a simple and fast method for computing parameterizations with strictly bounded distortion. The new method operates by flattening the mesh onto a region of the 2D plane. To comply with the distortion bound, the mesh is automatically cut and partitioned on-the-fly. The method guarantees avoiding global and local self-intersections, while attempting to minimize the total length of the introduced seams. To our knowledge, this is the first method to compute the mesh partitioning and the parameterization simultaneously and entirely automatically, while providing guaranteed distortion bounds. Our results on a variety of objects demonstrate that the method is fast enough to work with large complex irregular meshes in interactive applications.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183795/","LOCKED","1183795","Sch. of Comput.

The clipping tests exploit per-fragment operations on the graphics hardware to achieve high frame rates. In combination with texture-based volume rendering, these techniques enable the user to interactively select and explore regions of the data set. We present depth-based clipping techniques that analyze the depth structure of the boundary representation of the clip geometry to decide which parts of the volume have to be clipped. In another approach, a voxelized clip object is used to identify the clipped regions.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183762/","LOCKED","1183762","Visualization & Interactive Syst.

"While many methods exist for visualising scalar and vector data, visualisation of tensor data is still troublesome. We present a method for visualising second order tensors in three dimensions using a hybrid between direct volume rendering and glyph rendering. An overview scalar field is created by using three-dimensional adaptive filtering of a scalar field containing noise. The filtering process is controlled by the tensor field to be visualised, creating patterns that characterise the tensor field. By combining direct volume rendering of the scalar field with standard glyph rendering methods for detailed tensor visualisation, a hybrid solution is created. A combined volume and glyph renderer was implemented and tested with both synthetic tensors and strain-rate tensors from the human heart muscle, calculated from phase contrast magnetic resonance image data. A comprehensible result could be obtained, giving both an overview of the tensor field as well as detailed information on individual tensors.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183797/","LOCKED","1183797","Dept. of Medicine & Care, Linkoping Univ., Sweden","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37938415900","1","A.

"Interactive visualization of large digital elevation models is of continuing interest in scientific visualization, GIS, and virtual reality applications. Taking advantage of the regular structure of grid digital elevation models, efficient hierarchical multiresolution triangulation and adaptive level-of-detail (LOD) rendering algorithms have been developed for interactive terrain visualization. Despite the higher triangle count, these approaches generally outperform mesh simplification methods that produce irregular triangulated network (TIN) based LOD representations. In this project we combine the advantage of a TIN based mesh simplification preprocess with high-performance quadtree based LOD triangulation and rendering at run-time. This approach, called QuadTIN, generates an efficient quadtree triangulation hierarchy over any irregular point set that may originate from irregular terrain sampling or from reducing oversampling in high-resolution grid digital elevation models.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183800/","LOCKED","1183800","Dept. of Inf. & Comput.

"Direct volume rendering is a commonly used technique in visualization applications. Many of these applications require sophisticated shading models to capture subtle lighting effects and characteristics of volumetric data and materials. Many common objects and natural phenomena exhibit visual quality that cannot be captured using simple lighting models or cannot be solved at interactive rates using more sophisticated methods. We present a simple yet effective interactive shading model which captures volumetric light attenuation effects to produce volumetric shadows and the subtle appearance of translucency. We also present a technique for volume displacement or perturbation that allows realistic interactive modeling of high frequency detail for real and synthetic volumetric data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183764/","LOCKED","1183764","Sci.

"In this paper we develop a new technique for tracing anatomical fibers from 3D tensor fields. The technique extracts salient tensor features using a local regularization technique that allows the algorithm to cross noisy regions and bridge gaps in the data. We applied the method to human brain DT-MRI data and recovered identifiable anatomical structures that correspond to the white matter brain-fiber pathways. The images in this paper are derived from a dataset having 121/spl times/88/spl times/60 resolution. We were able to recover fibers with less than the voxel size resolution by applying the regularization technique, i.e., using a priori assumptions about fiber smoothness. The regularization procedure is done through a moving least squares filter directly incorporated in the tracing algorithm.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183799/","LOCKED","1183799","Dept. of Comput.

"Novel speech and/or gesture interfaces are candidates for use in future mobile or ubiquitous applications. This paper describes an evaluation of various interfaces for visual navigation of a whole Earth 3D terrain model. A mouse driven interface, a speech interface, a gesture interface, and a multimodal speech and gesture interface were used to navigate to targets placed at various points on the Earth. This study measured each participant's recall of target identity, order, and location as a measure of cognitive load. Timing information as well as a variety of subjective measures including discomfort and user preference were taken. While the familiar and mature mouse interface scored best by most measures, the speech interface also performed well. The gesture and multimodal interface suffered from weaknesses in the gesture modality. Weaknesses in the speech and multimodal modalities are identified and areas for improvement are discussed.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183802/","LOCKED","1183802","Coll. of Comput., Georgia Inst. of Technol., Atlanta, GA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37391946800","1","D.M.

"This paper introduces a method for smoothing complex, noisy surfaces, while preserving (and enhancing) sharp, geometric features. It has two main advantages over previous approaches to feature preserving surface smoothing. First is the use of level set surface models, which allows us to process very complex shapes of arbitrary and changing topology. This generality makes it well suited for processing surfaces that are derived directly from measured data. The second advantage is that the proposed method derives from a well-founded formulation, which is a natural generalization of anisotropic diffusion, as used in image processing. This formulation is based on the proposition that the generalization of image filtering entails filtering the normals of the surface, rather than processing the positions of points on a mesh.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183766/","LOCKED","1183766","Sch. of Comput., Utah Univ., Salt Lake City, UT, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37265762400","1","T.

"Within the field of computer graphics and visualization, it is often necessary to visualize polygonal models with large number of polygons. Display quality is mandatory, but it is also desirable to have the ability to rapidly update the display in order to facilitate interactive use. Point based rendering methods have been shown effective for this task. Building on this paradigm we introduce the PMR system which uses a hierarchy both in points and triangles for rendering. This hierarchy is fundamentally different from the ones used in existing methods. It is based on the feature geometry in the object space rather than its projection in the screen space. This provides certain advantages over the existing methods.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183770/","LOCKED","1183770","Ohio State Univ., Columbus, OH, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37564265400","1","T.K.

"We present a generalization of the geometry coder by Touma and Gotsman (1998) to polygon meshes. We let the polygon information dictate where to apply the parallelogram rule that they use to predict vertex positions. Since polygons tend to be fairly planar and fairly convex, it is beneficial to make predictions within a polygon rather than across polygons. This, for example, avoids poor predictions due to a crease angle between polygons. Up to 90 percent of the vertices can be predicted this way. Our strategy improves geometry compression by 10 to 40 percent depending on (a) how polygonal the mesh is and (b) on the quality (planarity/convexity) of the polygons.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183768/","LOCKED","1183768","North Carolina Univ., Chapel Hill, NC, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37281897600","1","M.

"Isosurfaces are commonly used to visualize scalar fields. Critical isovalues indicate isosurface topology changes: the creation of new surface components, merging of surface components or the formation of holes in a surface component. Therefore, they highlight interesting isosurface behavior and are helpful in exploration of large trivariate data sets. We present a method that detects critical isovalues in a scalar field defined by piecewise trilinear interpolation over a rectilinear grid and describe how to use them when examining volume data. We further review varieties of the marching cubes (MC) algorithm, with the intention of preserving topology of the trilinear interpolant when extracting an isosurface. We combine and extend two approaches in such a way that it is possible to extract meaningful isosurfaces even when a critical value is chosen as the isovalue.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183772/","LOCKED","1183772","AG Graphische Datenverarbeitung und Computergeometrie, Kaiserslautern Univ., Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37411444100","1","G.H.

"The analysis of multidimensional functions is important in many engineering disciplines, and poses a major problem as the number of dimensions increases. Previous visualization approaches focus on representing three or fewer dimensions at a time. This paper presents a new focus+context visualization that provides an integrated overview of an entire multidimensional function space, with uniform treatment of all dimensions. The overview is displayed with respect to a user-controlled polar focal point in the function's parameter space. Function value patterns are viewed along rays that emanate from the focal point in all directions in the parameter space, and represented radially around the focal point in the visualization. Data near the focal point receives proportionally more screen space than distant data. This approach scales smoothly from two dimensions to 10-20, with a 1000 pixel range on each dimension.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183806/","LOCKED","1183806","Center for Human Comput.

A recursive tetrahedral mesh refinement scheme, based on longest edge bisection, is used to hierarchically decompose the data into a multiresolution structure. This data structure allows fast extraction of arbitrary isosurfaces to within user specified view-dependent error bounds. A data layout scheme based on hierarchical space filling curves provides access to the data in a cache coherent manner that follows the data access pattern indicated by the mesh refinement.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183810/","LOCKED","1183810","Center for Appl.

"This paper introduces two efficient algorithms that compute the Contour Tree of a 3D scalar field /spl Fscr/ and its augmented version with the Betti numbers of each isosurface. The Contour Tree is a fundamental data structure in scientific visualization that is used to preprocess the domain mesh to allow optimal computation of isosurfaces with minimal overhead storage. The Contour Tree can also be used to build user interfaces reporting the complete topological characterization of a scalar field. The first part of the paper presents a new scheme that augments the Contour Tree with the Betti numbers of each isocontour in linear time. We show how to extend the scheme with the Betti number computation without increasing its complexity. Thus, we improve on the time complexity from our previous approach from O(m log m) to O(n log n+m), where m is the number of tetrahedra and n is the number of vertices in the domain of /spl Fscr/. The second part of the paper introduces a new divide-and-conquer algorithm that computes the Augmented Contour Tree with improved efficiency. The central part of the scheme computes the output Contour Tree by merging two intermediate Contour Trees and is independent of the interpolant. In this way we confine any knowledge regarding a specific interpolant to an oracle that computes the tree for a single cell. We have implemented this oracle for the trilinear interpolant and plan to replace it with higher order interpolants when needed. The complexity of the scheme is O(n+t log n), where t is the number of critical points of /spl Fscr/. For the first time we can compute the Contour Tree in linear time in many practical cases when t=O(n/sup 1-/spl epsi//). Lastly, we report the running times for a parallel implementation of our algorithm, showing good scalability with the number of processors.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183774/","LOCKED","1183774","Center of Appl.

"We present some new methods for computing estimates of normal vectors at the vertices of a triangular mesh surface approximation to an isosurface which has been computed by the marching cube algorithm. These estimates are required for the smooth rendering of triangular mesh surfaces. The conventional method of computing estimates based upon divided difference approximations of the gradient can lead to poor estimates in some applications. This is particularly true for isosurfaces obtained from a field function, which is defined only for values near to the isosurface. We describe some efficient methods for computing the topology of the triangular mesh surface, which is used for obtaining local estimates of the normals. In addition, a new, one pass, approach for these types of applications is described and compared to existing methods.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183808/","LOCKED","1183808","Comput.

"We report on using computed tomography (CT) as a model acquisition tool for complex objects in computer graphics. Unlike other modeling and scanning techniques the complexity of the object is irrelevant in CT, which naturally enables to model objects with, for example, concavities, holes, twists or fine surface details. Once the data is scanned, one can apply post-processing techniques for data enhancement, modification or presentation. For demonstration purposes we chose to scan a Christmas tree which exhibits high complexity which is difficult or even impossible to handle with other techniques. However, care has to be taken to achieve good scanning results with CT. Further, we illustrate post-processing by means of data segmentation and photorealistic as well as non-photorealistic surface and volume rendering techniques.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183812/","LOCKED","1183812","Inst. of Comput.

"Many direct volume rendering algorithms have been proposed during the last decade to render 256/sup 3/ voxels interactively. However a lot of limitations are inherent to all of them, like low-quality images, a small viewport size or a fixed classification. In contrast, interactive high quality algorithms are still a challenge nowadays. We introduce here an efficient and accurate technique called object-order ray-casting that can achieve up to 10 fps on current workstations. Like usual ray-casting, colors and opacities are evenly sampled along the ray, but now within a new object-order algorithm. Thus, it allows to combine the main advantages of both worlds in term of speed and quality. We also describe an efficient hidden volume removal technique to compensate for the loss of early ray termination.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183776/","LOCKED","1183776","Inst. de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse (IRIT), Univ.

"We present a method for interactive rendering of large outdoor scenes. Complex polygonal plant models and whole plant populations are represented by relatively small sets of point and line primitives. This enables us to show landscapes faithfully using only a limited percentage of primitives. In addition, a hierarchical data structure allows us to smoothly reduce the geometrical representation to any desired number of primitives. The scene is hierarchically divided into local portions of geometry to achieve large reduction factors for distant regions. Additionally, the data reduction is adapted to the visual importance of geometric objects. This allows us to maintain the visual fidelity of the representation while reducing most of the geometry drastically. With our system, we are able to interactively render very complex landscapes with good visual quality.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183778/","LOCKED","1183778","Fac. of Comput.

"To display the intuitive meaning of an abstract metric it is helpful to look on an embedded surface with the same inner geometry as the given metric. The resulting partial differential equations have no standard solution. Only for some special cases satisfactory methods are known. I present a new algorithmic approach which is not based on differential equations. In contrast to other methods this technique also works if the embedding exists only locally. The fundamental idea is to estimate Euclidean distances, from which the surface is built up. In this paper I focus on the reconstruction of a surface from these estimated distances. Particular the influence of a perturbation of the distances on the shape of the resulting surface is investigated.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183782/","LOCKED","1183782","Dept. of Comput.

"For some graphics applications, object interiors and hard-to-see regions contribute little to the final images and need not be processed. In this paper, we define a view-independent visibility measure on mesh surfaces based on the visibility function between the surfaces and a surrounding sphere of cameras. We demonstrate the usefulness of this measure with a visibility-guided simplification algorithm. Mesh simplification reduces the polygon counts of 3D models and speeds up the rendering process. Many mesh simplification algorithms are based on sequences of edge collapses that minimize geometric and attribute errors. By combining the surface visibility measure with a geometric error measure, we obtain simplified models with improvement proportional to the number of low visibility regions in the original models.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183784/","LOCKED","1183784","GVU Center & Coll. of Comput., Georgia Inst. of Technol., Atlanta, GA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38145176200","1","E.

"Ocean model simulations commonly assume the ocean is hydrostatic, resulting in near zero vertical motion. The vertical motion found is typically associated with the variations of the thermocline depth over time, which are mainly a result of the development and movement of ocean fronts, eddies, and internal waves. A new technique, extended from Lagrangian-Eulerian Advection, is presented to help understand the variation of vertical motion associated with the change in thermocline depth over time. A time surface is correctly deformed in a single direction according to the flow. The evolution of the time surface is computed via a mixture of Eulerian and Lagrangian techniques. The dominant horizontal motion is textured onto the surface using texture advection, while both the horizontal and vertical motions are used to displace the surface. The resulting surface is shaded for enhanced contrast. Timings indicate that the overhead over standard 2D texture advection is no more than 12%.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183822/","LOCKED","1183822","Center for Ocean-Atmos.

"Critical points of a vector field are key to their characterization. Their positions as well as their indexes are crucial for understanding vector fields. Considerable work exists in 2D, but less is available for 3D or higher dimensions. Geometric algebra is a derivative of Clifford algebra that not only enables a succinct definition of the index of a critical point in higher dimension; it also provides insight and computational pathways for calculating the index. We describe the problems in terms of geometric algebra and present an octree based solution using the algebra for finding critical points and their index in a 3D vector field.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183786/","LOCKED","1183786","Waterloo Univ., Ont., Canada","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37998748200","1","S.

"Comparative evaluation of visualization and experimental results is a critical step in computational steering. In this paper, we present a study of image comparison metrics for quantifying the magnitude of difference between visualization of a computer simulation and a photographic image captured from an experiment. We examined eleven metrics, including three spatial domain, four spatial-frequency domain and four HVS (human-vision system) metrics. Among these metrics, a spatial-frequency domain metric called 2nd-order Fourier comparison was proposed specifically for this work. Our study consisted of two stages: base cases and field trials. The former is a general study on a controlled comparison space using purposely selected data, and the latter involves imagery results from computational fluid dynamics and a rheological experiment. This study has introduced a methodological framework for analyzing image-level methods used in comparative visualization. For the eleven metrics considered, it has offered a set of informative indicators as to the strengths and weaknesses of each metric. In particular, we have identified three image comparison metrics that are effective in separating ""similar"" and ""different"" image groups. Our 2nd-order Fourier comparison metric has compared favorably with others in two of the three tests, and has shown its potential to be used for steering computer simulation quantitatively.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183790/","LOCKED","1183790","Univ. of Wales, Swansea, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38150365000","1","Hualin Zhou","38150365000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Univ. of Wales, Swansea, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37065321900","2","Min Chen","37065321900","Univ. of Wales, Swansea, UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37346467200","3","M.F.

"We present a robust, noise-resistant criterion characterizing plane-like skeletons in binary voxel objects. It is based on a distance map and the geodesic distance along the object's boundary. A parameter allows us to control the noise sensitivity. If needed, homotopy with the original object might be reconstructed in a second step, using an improved distance ordered thinning algorithm. The skeleton is analyzed to create a geometric representation for rendering. Plane-like parts are transformed into an triangulated surface not enclosing a volume by a suitable triangulation scheme. The resulting surfaces have lower triangle count than those created with standard methods and tend to maintain the original geometry, even after simplification with a high decimation rate. Our algorithm allows us to interactively render expressive images of complex 3D structures, emphasizing independently plane-like and rod-like structures. The methods are applied for visualization of the microstructure of bone biopsies.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183753/","LOCKED","1183753","Dept. for Sci. Visualization, Zuse Inst.

"Most systems used for creating and displaying colormap-based visualizations are not photometrically calibrated. That is, the relationship between RGB input levels and perceived luminance is usually not known, due to variations in the monitor, hardware configuration, and the viewing environment. However, the luminance component of perceptually based colormaps should be controlled, due to the central role that luminance plays in our visual processing. We address this problem with a simple and effective method for performing luminance matching on an uncalibrated monitor. The method is akin to the minimally distinct border technique (a previous method of luminance matching used for measuring luminous efficiency), but our method relies on the brain's highly developed ability to distinguish human faces. We present a user study showing that our method produces equivalent results to the minimally distinct border technique, but with significantly improved precision. We demonstrate how results from our luminance matching method can be directly applied to create new univariate colormaps.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183788/","LOCKED","1183788","Sch. of Comput., Utah Univ., Salt Lake City, UT, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282742400","1","G.

"A long-standing research problem in computer graphics is to reproduce the visual experience of walking through a large photorealistic environment interactively. On one hand, traditional geometry-based rendering systems fall short of simulating the visual realism of a complex environment. On the other hand, image-based rendering systems have to date been unable to capture and store a sampled representation of a large environment with complex lighting and visibility effects. In this paper, we present a ""sea of images,"" a practical approach to dense sampling, storage, and reconstruction of the plenoptic function in large, complex indoor environments. We use a motorized cart to capture omnidirectional images every few inches on a eye-height plane throughout an environment. The captured images are compressed and stored in a multiresolution hierarchy suitable for real-time prefetching during an interactive walkthrough. Later, novel images are reconstructed for a simulated observer by resampling nearby captured images. Our system acquires 15,254 images over 1,050 square feet at an average image spacing of 1.5 inches. The average capture and processing time is 7 hours. We demonstrate realistic walkthroughs of real-world environments reproducing specular reflections and occlusion effects while rendering 15-25 frames per second.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183792/","LOCKED","1183792","Lucent Technol.

"This paper presents a new technique for the extraction of surfaces from 3D ultrasound data. Surface extraction from ultrasound data is challenging for a number of reasons including noise and artifacts in the images and nonuniform data sampling. A method is proposed to fit an approximating radial basis function to the group of data samples. An explicit surface is then obtained by iso-surfacing the function. In most previous 3D ultrasound research, a pre-processing step is taken to interpolate the data into a regular voxel array and a corresponding loss of resolution. We are the first to represent the set of semi-structured ultrasound pixel data as a single function. From this we are able to extract surfaces without first reconstructing the irregularly spaced pixels into a regular 3D voxel array.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183755/","LOCKED","1183755","Dept. of Comput.

"In this paper, we address the problem of automatic camera positioning and automatic camera path generation in the context of historical data visualization. After short description of the given data, we elaborate on the constraints for the positioning of a virtual camera in such a way that not only the projected area is maximized, but also the depth of the displayed scene. This is especially important when displaying terrain models, which do not provide good 3D impression when only the projected area is maximized. Based on this concept, we present a method for computing an optimal camera position for each instant of time. Since the explored data are not static, but change depending on the explored scene time, we also discuss a method for animation generation. In order to avoid sudden changes of the camera position, when the previous method is applied for each frame (point in time), we introduce pseudo-events in time, which expand the bounding box defined by the currently active events of interest. In particular, this technique allows events happening in a future point in time to be taken into account such that when this time becomes current, all events of interest are already within the current viewing frustum of the camera.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183826/","LOCKED","1183826","Tubingen Univ., Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37730629300","1","S.L.

The light attenuation is modeled using splatting volume renderer for both the viewer and the light source. During the rendering, a 2D shadow buffer attenuates the light for each pixel. When the contribution of a footprint is added to the image buffer, as seen from the eye, we add the contribution to the shadow buffer, as seen from the light source. We have generated shadows for point lights and parallel lights using this algorithm. The shadow algorithm has been extended to deal with multiple light sources and projective textured lights.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183761/","LOCKED","1183761","Dept. of Comput. & Inf.

"We present a novel disk-based multiresolution triangle mesh data structure that supports paging and view-dependent rendering of very large meshes at interactive frame rates from external memory. Our approach, called XFastMesh, is based on a view-dependent mesh simplification framework that represents half-edge collapse operations in a binary hierarchy known as a merge-tree forest. The proposed technique partitions the merge-tree forest into so-called detail blocks, which consist of binary subtrees, that are stored on disk. We present an efficient external memory data structure and file format that stores all detail information of the multiresolution triangulation method using significantly less storage then previously reported approaches. Furthermore, we present a paging algorithm that provides efficient loading and interactive rendering of large meshes from external memory at varying and view-dependent level-of-detail. The presented approach is highly efficient both in terms of space cost and paging performance.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183796/","LOCKED","1183796","Dept. of Inf. & Comput.

"We present an external memory algorithm for fast display of very large and complex geometric environments. We represent the model using a scene graph and employ different culling techniques for rendering acceleration. Our algorithm uses a parallel approach to render the scene as well as fetch objects from the disk in a synchronous manner. We present a novel prioritized prefetching technique that takes into account LOD-switching and visibility-based events between successive frames. We have applied our algorithm to large gigabyte-sized environments that are composed of thousands of objects and tens of millions of polygons. The memory overhead of our algorithm is output sensitive and is typically tens of megabytes. In practice, our approach scales with the model sizes, and its rendering performance is comparable to that of an in-core algorithm.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183759/","LOCKED","1183759","Dept. of Comput.

"We describe a method for volume rendering using a spectral representation of colour instead of the traditional RGB model. It is shown how to use this framework for a novel exploration of datasets through enhanced transfer function design. Furthermore, our framework is extended to allow real-time re-lighting of the scene created with any rendering method. The technique of post-illumination is introduced to generate new spectral images for arbitrary light colours in real-time. Also a tool is described to design a palette of lights and materials having certain properties such as selective metamerism or colour constancy. Applied to spectral transfer functions, different light colours can accentuate or hide specific qualities of the data. In connection with post-illumination this provides a new degree of freedom for guided exploration of volumetric data, which cannot be achieved using the RGB model.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183763/","LOCKED","1183763","Dept. of Simulation & Graphics, Magdeburg Univ., Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37418878100","1","S.

"Visualizing second-order 3D tensor fields continue to be a challenging task. Although there are several algorithms that have been presented, no single algorithm by itself is sufficient for the analysis because of the complex nature of tensor fields. In this paper, we present two new methods, based on volume deformation, to show the effects of the tensor field upon its underlying media. We focus on providing a continuous representation of the nature of the tensor fields. Each of these visualization algorithms is good at displaying some particular properties of the tensor field.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183798/","LOCKED","1183798","Dept. of Comput.

"We present a technique to perform occlusion culling for hierarchical terrains at run-time. The algorithm is simple to implement and requires minimal pre-processing and additional storage, yet leads to 2-4 times improvement in framerate for views with high degrees of occlusion. Our method is based on the well-known occlusion horizon algorithm. We show how to adapt the algorithm for use with hierarchical terrains. The occlusion horizon is constructed as the terrain is traversed in an approximate front to back ordering. Regions of the terrain are compared to the horizon to determine when they are completely occluded from the viewpoint. Culling these regions leads to significant savings in rendering.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183801/","LOCKED","1183801","Brigham Young Univ., Provo, UT, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38559383300","1","B.

"We present a new multiphase method for efficiently simplifying polygonal surface models of arbitrary size. It operates by combining an initial out-of-core uniform clustering phase with a subsequent in-core iterative edge contraction phase. These two phases are both driven by quadric error metrics, and quadrics are used to pass information about the original surface between phases. The result is a method that produces approximations of a quality comparable to quadric-based iterative edge contraction, but at a fraction of the cost in terms of running time and memory consumption.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183765/","LOCKED","1183765","Illinois Univ., Urbana, IL, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272036400","1","M.

"This paper presents a new technique for visualizing large, complex collections of data. The size and dimensionality of these datasets make them challenging to display in an effective manner. The images must show the global structure of spatial relationships within the dataset, yet at the same time accurately represent the local detail of each data element being visualized. We propose combining ideas from information and scientific visualization together with a navigation assistant, a software system designed to help users identify and explore areas of interest within their data. The assistant locates data elements of potential importance to the user, clusters them into spatial regions, and builds underlying graph structures to connect the regions and the elements they contain. Graph traversal algorithms, constraint-based viewpoint construction, and intelligent camera planning techniques can then be used to design animated tours of these regions. In this way, the navigation assistant can help users to explore any of the areas of interest within their data. We conclude by demonstrating how our assistant is being used to visualize a multidimensional weather dataset.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183803/","LOCKED","1183803","Dept. of Comput.

"This paper introduces an algorithm for rapid progressive simplification of tetrahedral meshes: TetFusion. We describe how a simple geometry decimation operation steers a rapid and controlled progressive simplification of tetrahedral meshes, while also taking care of complex mesh-inconsistency problems. The algorithm features a high decimation ratio per step, and inherently discourages any cases of self-intersection of boundary, element-boundary intersection at concave boundary-regions, and negative volume tetrahedra (flipping). We achieved rigorous reduction ratios of up to 98% for meshes consisting of 827,904 elements in less than 2 minutes, progressing through a series of level-of-details (LoDs) of the mesh in a controlled manner. We describe how the approach supports a balanced re-distribution of space between tetrahedral elements, and explain some useful control parameters that make it faster and more intuitive than 'edge collapse'-based decimation methods for volumetric meshes. Finally, we discuss how this approach can be employed for rapid LoD prototyping of large time-varying datasets as an aid to interactive visualization.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183767/","LOCKED","1183767","Eng.

"We introduce, analyze and quantitatively compare a number of surface simplification methods for point-sampled geometry. We have implemented incremental and hierarchical clustering, iterative simplification, and particle simulation algorithms to create approximations of point-based models with lower sampling density. All these methods work directly on the point cloud, requiring no intermediate tesselation. We show how local variation estimation and quadric error metrics can be employed to diminish the approximation error and concentrate more samples in regions of high curvature. To compare the quality of the simplified surfaces, we have designed a new method for computing numerical and visual error estimates for point-sampled surfaces. Our algorithms are fast, easy to implement, and create high-quality surface approximations, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of point-based surface simplification.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183771/","LOCKED","1183771","Eidgenossische Tech.

"Motion provides strong visual cues for the perception of shape and depth, as demonstrated by cognitive scientists and visual artists. This paper presents a novel visualization technique-kinetic visualization -that uses particle systems to add supplemental motion cues which can aid in the perception of shape and spatial relationships of static objects. Based on a set of rules following perceptual and physical principles, particles flowing over the surface of an object not only bring out, but also attract attention to, essential information on the shape of the object that might not be readily visible with conventional rendering that uses lighting and view changes. Replacing still images with animations in this fashion, we demonstrate with both surface and volumetric models in the accompanying videos that in many cases the resulting visualizations effectively enhance the perception of three-dimensional shape and structure. The results of a preliminary user study that we have conducted also show evidence that the supplemental motion cues help.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183805/","LOCKED","1183805","Dept. of Comput.

"Efficient and informative visualization of surfaces with uncertainties is an important topic with many applications in science and engineering. Examples include environmental pollution borderline identification, identification of the limits of an oil basin, or discrimination between contaminated and healthy tissue in medicine. This paper presents an approach for such visualization using points as display primitives. The approach is to render each polygon as a collection of points and to displace each point from the surface in the direction of the surface normal by an amount proportional to some random number multiplied by the uncertainty level at that point. This approach can be used in combination with other techniques such as pseudo-coloring and shading to give rise to efficient and revealing visualizations. The method is used to visualize real and simulated tumor formations with uncertainty of tumor boundaries.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183769/","LOCKED","1183769","Maryland Univ., Baltimore, MD, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282290900","1","G.

"Typically 3-D MR and CT scans have a relatively high resolution in the scanning X-Y plane, but much lower resolution in the axial Z direction. This non-uniform sampling of an object can miss small or thin structures. One way to address this problem is to scan the same object from multiple directions. In this paper we describe a method for deforming a level set model using velocity information derived from multiple volume datasets with non-uniform resolution in order to produce a single high-resolution 3D model. The method locally approximates the values of the multiple datasets by fitting a distance-weighted polynomial using moving least-squares. The proposed method has several advantageous properties: its computational cost is proportional to the object surface area, it is stable with respect to noise, imperfect registrations and abrupt changes in the data, it provides gain-correction, and it employs a distance-based weighting to ensures that the contributions from each scan are properly merged into the final result. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach on four multi-scan datasets, a Griffin laser scan reconstruction, a CT scan of a teapot and MR scans of a mouse embryo and a zucchini.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183773/","LOCKED","1183773","Dept. of Comput.

"In this paper we introduce a new and simple algorithm to compress isosurface data. This is the data extracted by isosurface algorithms from scalar functions defined on volume grids, and used to generate polygon meshes or alternative representations. In this algorithm the mesh connectivity and a substantial proportion of the geometric information are encoded to a fraction of a bit per marching cubes vertex with a context based arithmetic coder closely related to the JBIG binary image compression standard. The remaining optional geometric information that specifies the location of each marching cubes vertex more precisely along its supporting intersecting grid edge, is efficiently encoded in scan-order with the same mechanism. Vertex normals can optionally be computed as normalized gradient vectors by the encoder and included in the bitstream after quantization and entropy encoding, or computed by the decoder in a postprocessing smoothing step. These choices are determined by trade-offs associated with an in-core vs. out-of-core decoder structure. The main features of our algorithm are its extreme simplicity and high compression rates.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183807/","LOCKED","1183807","IBM Thomas J. Watson Res.

In this paper, we take full advantage of scalar volume rendering hardware, such as VolumePro, to realize a realtime 3D flow field visualization environment with the LIC volume rendering method.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183811/","LOCKED","1183811","Mitsubishi Electr.

"We present a fast and reliable space-leaping scheme to accelerate ray casting during interactive navigation in a complex volumetric scene, where we combine innovative space-leaping techniques in a number of ways. First, we derive most of the pixel depths at the current frame by exploiting the temporal coherence during navigation, where we employ a novel fast cell-based reprojection scheme that is more reliable than the traditional intersection-point based reprojection. Next, we exploit the object space coherence to quickly detect the remaining pixel depths, by using a precomputed accurate distance field that stores the Euclidean distance from each empty (background) voxel toward its nearest object boundary. In addition, we propose an effective solution to the challenging new-incoming-objects problem during navigation. Our algorithm has been implemented on a 16-processor SGI Power Challenge and reached interactive rendering rates at more than 10 Hz during the navigation inside 512/sup 3/ volume data sets acquired from both a simulation phantom and actual patients.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183775/","LOCKED","1183775","Boeing Co., Seattle, WA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37362958300","1","Ming Wan","37362958300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38139540100","2","A.

"Polygonal approximations of isosurfaces extracted from uniformly sampled volumes are increasing in size due to the availability of higher resolution imaging techniques. The large number of I primitives represented hinders the interactive exploration of the dataset. Though many solutions have been proposed to this problem, many require the creation of isosurfaces at multiple resolutions or the use of additional data structures, often hierarchical, to represent the volume. We propose a technique for adaptive isosurface extraction that is easy to implement and allows the user to decide the degree of adaptivity as well as the choice of isosurface extraction algorithm. Our method optimizes the extraction of the isosurface by warping the volume. In a warped volume, areas of importance (e.g. containing significant details) are inflated while unimportant ones are contracted. Once the volume is warped, any extraction algorithm can be applied. The extracted mesh is subsequently unwarped such that the warped areas are rescaled to their initial proportions. The resulting isosurface is represented by a mesh that is more densely sampled in regions decided as important.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183809/","LOCKED","1183809","IBM Thomas J.

"Simulating hand-drawn illustration techniques can succinctly express information in a manner that is communicative and informative. We present a framework for an interactive direct volume illustration system that simulates traditional stipple drawing. By combining the principles of artistic and scientific illustration, we explore several feature enhancement techniques to create effective, interactive visualizations of scientific and medical datasets. We also introduce a rendering mechanism that generates appropriate point lists at all resolutions during an automatic preprocess, and modifies rendering styles through different combinations of these feature enhancements. The new system is an effective way to interactively preview large, complex volume datasets in a concise, meaningful, and illustrative manner. Volume stippling is effective for many applications and provides a quick and efficient method to investigate volume models.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1183777/","LOCKED","1183777","Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38155731600","1","Aidong Lu","38155731600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38000798200","2","C.J.
