"Noise reduction is an important preprocessing step for many visualization techniques that make use of feature extraction. We propose a method for denoising 2-D vector fields that are corrupted by additive noise. The method is based on the vector wavelet transform and wavelet coefficient thresholding. We compare our wavelet-based denoising method with Gaussian filtering, and test the effect of these methods on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the vector fields before and after denoising. We also study the effect on relevant details for visualization, such as vortex measures. The results show that for low SNR, Gaussian filtering with large kernels has a somewhat higher performance than the wavelet-based method in terms of SNR. For larger SNR, the wavelet-based method outperforms Gaussian filtering. This is mostly due to the fact that Gaussian filtering tends to remove small details, which are preserved by the wavelet-based method.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372274/","LOCKED","1372274","University of Stuttgart","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282586000","1","M.A. Westenberg","37282586000","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268023800","2","T.

"We describe a method for processing large amounts of volumetric data collected from a Knife Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM). The neuronal data that we acquire consists of thin, branching structures extending over very large regions that prior volumetric representations have difficulty dealing with efficiently.

"Summary form only given. A self-illustrating phenomenon is an image which exposes the science behind it. Some famous examples are pictures of iron filings aligned along magnetic lines of force, sand particles collecting at the stationary points of the standing waves of a violin, stress in a mechanical part revealed through birefringence, and particle tracks in a bubble chamber. Such images brilliantly combine experimental design, analysis, and visualization. Quoting J. Tukey, ""the general purposes of conducting experiments and analyzing data match, point by point"". We argue in this talk that computer tools for visual analysis should normally be conceived of as aids in constructing computational visual experiments; and that the resulting visualizations be consciously designed to help validate or invalidate the hypothesis being tested by the experiment.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372172/","LOCKED","1372172","Comput.

"Multimedia objects are often described by high-dimensional feature vectors which can be used for retrieval and clustering tasks. We have built an interactive retrieval system for 3D model databases that implements a variety of different feature transforms. Recently, we have enhanced the functionality of our system by integrating a SOM-based visualization module. In this poster demo, we show how 2D maps can be used to improve the effectiveness of retrieval, clustering, and over-viewing tasks in a 3D multimedia system.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372251/","LOCKED","1372251","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138400","1","B.

"Modern object-oriented programs are hierarchical systems with many thousands of interrelated subsystems. Visualization helps developers to better comprehend these large and complex systems. This work presents a three-dimensional visualization technique that represents the static structure of object-oriented software using distributions of three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional plane. The visual complexity is reduced by adjusting the transparency of object surfaces to the distance of the viewpoint. An approach called Hierarchical Net is proposed for a clear representation of the relationships between the subsystems.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372253/","LOCKED","1372253","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282568100","1","M.

"Although there is a remarkable pace in the advance of computational resources and storage for real-time visualization the immensity of the input data continues to outstrip any advances. The task for interactively visualizing such a massive terrain is to render a triangulated mesh using a view-dependent error tolerance, thus intelligently and perceptually managing the scene’s geometric complexity. At any particular instance in time (i.e. displayed frame), this level-of-detail (LOD) terrain surface consists of a mesh composed of hundreds of thousands of dynamically selected triangles. The triangles are selected using the current time-step’s view parameters and the view-dependent error tolerance. Massive terrain data easily exceeds main memory storage capacity such that out-of-core rendering must be performed. This further complicates the triangle selection and terrain rendering owing to tertiary storage’s relatively poor performance.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372261/","LOCKED","1372261","University of California at Irvine","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272616700","1","Xiaohong Bao","37272616700","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282193800","2","R.

A separate simulation models the flame production and generates heat from a combustion process, which is used to trigger pyrolysis of the solid object. The decomposition is modeled using level set methods, and can handle complex topological changes.

"The visualization of any vector field is dependent on the relative velocity of the observer. In experimentally generated vector fields, the average value of the streamwise component of the global vector field is typically calculated and subtracted from each vector. We demonstrate that the resulting image, critical points, and vector field features are greatly influenced by the magnitude of the value subtracted from the streamwise velocity.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372273/","LOCKED","1372273","University of Minnesota","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282639600","1","T.

"Summary form only given. The human visual system is the result of evolution by natural selection and hence its design must incorporate detailed knowledge of the physical properties of the natural environment. This is an obvious statement, but the scientific community has been slow to take it seriously. Only recently has there been an increased effort to directly measure the statistical properties of natural scenes and compare them to the design and performance of the human visual system. This work describes some recent studies of the chromatic and geometrical properties of natural materials and natural images, as well as some perceptual and physiological studies designed to test how those physical properties are related to human perceptual mechanisms.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372171/","LOCKED","1372171","Dept. of Psychol., Texas Univ., Austin, TX, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282736800","1","W.S.

"Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the number one killer in the United States. Although it is well known that CHD mainly occurs due to blocked arteries, there are contradictory results from studies designed to identify basic causes for this common disease is. To find out more about the true reason for CHD, virtual models can be employed to better understand the way the heart functions. With such a model, scientists and surgeons are able to analyze the effects of different treatment options, and ultimately find more suited ways to prevent coronary heart diseases. To investigate a given model, appropriate navigation methods are required, including suitable input devices. For the visualization, graphics cards originally designed for gaming applications are used; so, it is a just natural transition to adapt gaming input devices to a visualization system for controlling of the navigation. These devices are usually well designed with respect to ergonomics and durability, yielding more degrees of freedom in steering than two-dimensional input devices, such as desktop mice. This poster describes a visualization system that provides the user with advanced control devices for navigation enabling interactive exploration of the model. Force-feedback and sound effects provide additional cues.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372281/","LOCKED","1372281","University of California at Irvine","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282584400","1","T.

"The automotive industry demands visual support for the verification of the quality of their products from the design phase to the manufacturing phase. This implies the need of tools for measurement planning, programming measuring devices, managing measurement data, and the visual exploration of the measurement results. To improve the quality control throughout the whole process chain an integration of such tools in a platform independent framework is crucial. We present eMMA (enhanced Measure Management Application), a client/server system integrating measurement planning, data management, and straightforward as well as sophisticated visual exploration tools in a single framework.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372252/","LOCKED","1372252","DFKI GmbH","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282578800","1","H.

"The purpose of visualization is not just to depict data, but to gain or present insight into the domain represented in data. However in visualization systems, this link between features in the data and the meaning of those features is often missing or implicit. It is assumed that the user, through looking at the output, will close the loop between representation and insight. An alternative is to view visualization tools as interfaces between data and insight, and to enrich this interface with capabilities linked to users’ conceptual models of the data. Preliminary work has been carried out to develop such an interface as a modular component that can be installed in a pipelined architecture. This poster expands the motivation for this work, and describes the initial implementation carried out within the Visualization Toolkit (VTK).","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372254/","LOCKED","1372254","University of Leeds","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282576200","1","D.J.

"Recent activity within the UK National e-Science Programme has identified a need to establish an ontology for visualization. Motivation for this includes defining web and grid services for visualization (the ‘semantic grid’), supporting collaborative work, curation, and underpinning visualization research and education. At a preliminary meeting, members of the UK visualization community identified a skeleton for the ontology. We have started to build on this by identifying how existing work might be related and utilized. We believe that the greatest challenge is reaching a consensus within the visualization community itself. This poster is intended as one step in this process, setting out the perceived needs for the ontology, and sketching initial directions. It is hoped that this will lead to debate, feedback and involvement across the community.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372256/","LOCKED","1372256","University of Leeds","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282576200","1","D.J.

"We present a novel scheme to interactively visualize time-varying scalar fields defined on a structured grid. The underlying approach is to maximize the use of current graphics hardware by using 3D texture mapping. This approach commonly suffers from an expensive voxelization of each time-step as well as from large size of the voxel array approximating each step. Hence, in our scheme, instead of explicitly voxelizing each scalar field, we directly store each time-step as a three dimensional texture in its native form. We create the function that warps a voxel grid into the given structured grid. At rendering time, we reconstruct the function at each pixel using hardware-based trilinear interpolation. The resulting coordinates allow us to compute the scalar value at this pixel using a second texture lookup. For fixed grids, the function remains constant across time-steps and only the scalar field table needs to be re-loaded as a texture. Our new approach achieves excellent performance with relatively low texture memory requirements and low approximation error.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372266/","LOCKED","1372266","Johns Hopkins University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37281026700","1","Yuan Chen","37281026700","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275763600","2","J.

"We address the texture level-of-detail problem for extremely large surfaces such as terrain during realtime, view-dependent rendering. A novel texture hierarchy is introduced based on 4-8 refinements of raster tiles, in which the texture grids in effect rotate 45 degrees for each level of refinement. This hierarchy provides twice as many levels of detail as conventional quadtree-style refinement schemes such as mipmaps, and thus provides per-pixel view-dependent filtering that is twice as close to the ideal cutoff frequency for an average pixel. Because of this more gradual change in low-pass filtering, and due to the more precise emulation of the ideal cutoff frequency, we find in practice that the transitions between texture levels of detail are not perceptible. This allows rendering systems to avoid the complexity and performance costs of per-pixel blending between texture levels of detail. The 4-8 texturing scheme is integrated into a variant of the real-time optimally adapting meshes (ROAM) algorithm for view-dependent multiresolution mesh generation. Improvements to ROAM included here are: the diamond data structure as a streamlined replacement for the triangle bintree elements, the use of low-pass-filtered geometry patches in place of individual triangles, integration of 4-8 textures, and a simple out-of-core data access mechanism for texture and geometry tiles.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372200/","LOCKED","1372200","California Univ., Davis, CA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282563100","1","L.M.

"The contour tree, an abstraction of a scalar field that encodes the nesting relationships of isosurfaces, can be used to accelerate isosurface extraction, to identify important isovalues for volume-rendering transfer functions, and to guide exploratory visualization through a flexible isosurface interface. Many real-world data sets produce unmanageably large contour trees which require meaningful simplification. We define local geometric measures for individual contours, such as surface area and contained volume, and provide an algorithm to compute these measures in a contour tree. We then use these geometric measures to simplify the contour trees, suppressing minor topological features of the data. We combine this with a flexible isosurface interface to allow users to explore individual contours of a dataset interactively.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372235/","LOCKED","1372235","Dept. of Comput.

"We describe a general algorithm to produce compatible 3D triangulations from spatial decompositions. Such triangulations match edges and faces across spatial cell boundaries, solving several problems in graphics and visualization including the crack problem found in adaptive isosurface generation, triangulation of arbitrary grids (including unstructured grids), clipping, and the interval tetrahedrization problem. The algorithm produces compatible triangulations on a cell-by-cell basis, using a modified Delaunay triangulation with a simple point ordering rule to resolve degenerate cases and produce unique triangulations across cell boundaries. The algorithm is naturally parallel since it requires no neighborhood cell information, only a unique, global point numbering. We show application of this algorithm to adaptive contour generation; tetrahedrization of unstructured meshes; clipping and interval volume mesh generation.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372199/","LOCKED","1372199","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282730100","1","W.J.

"Endonasal transsphenoidal pituitary surgery is a minimally invasive endoscopic procedure, applied to remove various kinds of pituitary tumors. To reduce the risk associated with this treatment, the surgeon must be skilled and well-prepared. Virtual endoscopy can be beneficial as a tool for training, preoperative planning and intraoperative support. This work introduces STEPS, a virtual endoscopy system designed to aid surgeons in getting acquainted with the endoscopic view, the handling of instruments, the transsphenoidal approach and challenges associated with the procedure. STEPS also assists experienced surgeons in planning a real endoscopic intervention by getting familiar with the individual patient anatomy, identifying landmarks, planning the approach and deciding upon the ideal target position of the actual surgical activity. Besides interactive visualization using two different first-hit ray casting techniques, the application provides navigation and perception aids and the possibility to simulate the procedure, including haptic feedback and simulation of surgical instruments.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372237/","LOCKED","1372237","VRVis Res.

"We present a tool for real-time visualization of motion features in 2D image sequences. The motion is estimated through an eigenvector analysis of the spatio-temporal structure tensor at every pixel location. This approach is computationally demanding but allows reliable velocity estimates as well as quality indicators for the obtained results. We use a 2D color map and a region of interest selector for the visualization of the velocities. On the selected velocities we apply a hierarchical smoothing scheme which allows the choice of the desired scale of the motion field. We demonstrate several examples of test sequences in which some persons are moving with different velocities than others. These persons are visually marked in the real-time display of the image sequence. The tool is also applied to angiography sequences to emphasize the blood flow and its distribution. An efficient processing of the data streams is achieved by mapping the operations onto the stream architecture of standard graphics cards. The card receives the images and performs both the motion estimation and visualization, taking advantage of the parallelism in the graphics processor and the superior memory bandwidth. The integration of data processing and visualization also saves on unnecessary data transfers and thus allows the real-time analysis of 320/spl times/240 images. We expect that on the newest generation of graphics hardware our tool could run in real time for the standard VGA format.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372241/","LOCKED","1372241","Caesar Res.

"We present a new level set method for reconstructing interfaces from point aggregations. Although level-set-based methods are advantageous because they can handle complicated topologies and noisy data, most tend to smooth the inherent roughness of the original data. Our objective is to enhance the quality of a reconstructed surface by preserving certain roughness-related characteristics of the original dataset. Our formulation employs the total variation of the surface as a roughness measure. The algorithm consists of two steps: a roughness-capturing flow and a roughness-preserving flow. The roughness capturing step attempts to construct a surface for which the original roughness is captured - distance flow is well suited for roughness capturing. Surface reconstruction is enhanced by using a total variation preserving (TVP) scheme for the roughness-preserving flow. The shock filter formulation of Osher and Rudin is exploited to achieve this goal. In practice, we have found that better results arc obtained by balancing the TVP term with a smoothing term based on curvature.

"ImageSurfer is a tool designed to explore correlations between two 3D scalar fields. Our scientific goal was to determine where a protein is located, and how much its concentration varies along the membrane of a neuronal dendrite. The 3D scalar field data sets fall into two categories: dendritic plasma membranes (defining the structure) and immunofluorescent staining (defining protein concentration along the structure). ImageSurfer enables scientists to analyze relationships between multiple data sets obtained with confocal microscopy by providing 3D surface view, height field, and graphing tools. Each tool reduces the complexity of the problem by extracting a restricted subset of data: finding a region of interest in 3D; getting a sense of relative concentrations in 2D, and getting exact concentration values in 1D. The current design is presented, along with the rationale for each design decision. The tool is already proving useful for data exploration, analysis, and presentation.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372239/","LOCKED","1372239","Dept. of Comput.

"All orientable metric surfaces are Riemann surfaces and admit global conformal parameterizations. Riemann surface structure is a fundamental structure and governs many natural physical phenomena, such as heat diffusion and electro-magnetic fields on the surface. A good parameterization is crucial for simulation and visualization. This paper provides an explicit method for finding optimal global conformal parameterizations of arbitrary surfaces. It relies on certain holomorphic differential forms and conformal mappings from differential geometry and Riemann surface theories. Algorithms are developed to modify topology, locate zero points, and determine cohomology types of differential forms. The implementation is based on a finite dimensional optimization method. The optimal parameterization is intrinsic to the geometry, preserves angular structure, and can play an important role in various applications including texture mapping, remeshing, morphing and simulation. The method is demonstrated by visualizing the Riemann surface structure of real surfaces represented as triangle meshes.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372206/","LOCKED","1372206","Dept. of Comput.

"Surface texture is among the most salient haptic characteristics of objects; it can induce vibratory contact forces that lead to perception of roughness. We present a new algorithm to display haptic texture information resulting from the interaction between two textured objects. We compute contact forces and torques using low-resolution geometric representations along with texture images that encode surface details. We also introduce a novel force model based on directional penetration depth and describe an efficient implementation on programmable graphics hardware that enables interactive haptic texture rendering of complex models. Our force model takes into account important factors identified by psychophysics studies and is able to haptically display interaction due to fine surface textures that previous algorithms do not capture.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372210/","LOCKED","1372210","Dept. of Comput.

"Visualization of 3D tensor fields continues to be a major challenge in terms of providing intuitive and uncluttered images that allow the users to better understand their data. The primary focus of this paper is on finding a formulation that lends itself to a stable numerical algorithm for extracting stable and persistent topological features from 2nd order real symmetric 3D tensors. While features in 2D tensors can be identified as either wedge or trisector points, in 3D, the corresponding stable features are lines, not just points. These topological feature lines provide a compact representation of the 3D tensor field and are essential in helping scientists and engineers understand their complex nature. Existing techniques work by finding degenerate points and are not numerically stable, and worse, produce both false positive and false negative feature points. This work seeks to address this problem with a robust algorithm that can extract these features in a numerically stable, accurate, and complete manner.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372212/","LOCKED","1372212","Dept. of Comput.

"Hardware-accelerated direct volume rendering of unstructured volumetric meshes is often based on tetrahedral cell projection, in particular, the projected tetrahedra (PT) algorithm and its variants. Unfortunately, even implementations of the most advanced variants of the PT algorithm are very prone to rendering artifacts. In this work, we identify linear interpolation in screen coordinates as a cause for significant rendering artifacts and implement the correct perspective interpolation for the PT algorithm with programmable graphics hardware. We also demonstrate how to use features of modern graphics hardware to improve the accuracy of the coloring of individual tetrahedra and the compositing of the resulting colors, in particular, by employing a logarithmic scale for the preintegrated color lookup table, using textures with high color resolution, rendering to floating-point color buffers, and alpha dithering. Combined with a correct visibility ordering, these techniques result in the first implementation of the PT algorithm without objectionable rendering artifacts. Apart from the important improvement in rendering quality, our approach also provides a test bed for different implementations of the PT algorithm that allows us to study the particular rendering artifacts introduced by these variants.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372176/","LOCKED","1372176","Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284293000","1","M.

The concept of singularity index is discussed and extended from the well-understood planar case to the more intricate three-dimensional setting. Assuming a tetrahedral grid with linear interpolation in space and time, vector field singularities obey rules imposed by fundamental invariants (Poincare index), which we use as a basis for an efficient tracking algorithm. We apply the presented algorithm to CFD datasets to illustrate its purpose. We examine structures that exhibit topological variations with time and describe some of the insight gained with our method.

"A new method for the simplification and the visualization of vector fields is presented based on the notion of centroidal Voronoi tessellations (CVT's). A CVT is a special Voronoi tessellation for which the generators of the Voronoi regions in the tessellation are also the centers of mass (or means) with respect to a prescribed density. A distance function in both the spatial and vector spaces is introduced to measure the similarity of the spatially distributed vector fields. Based on such a distance, vector fields are naturally clustered and their simplified representations are obtained. Our method combines simple geometric intuitions with the rigorously established optimality properties of the CVTs. It is simple to describe, easy to understand and implement. Numerical examples are also provided to illustrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of the CVT-based vector simplification and visualization methodology.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372178/","LOCKED","1372178","Dept. of Math., Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park, PA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267188300","1","Qiang Du","37267188300","Dept. of Math., Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park, PA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37281384800","2","Xiaoquiang Wang","37281384800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8","0","10-15 Oct. 2004","Austin, TX, USA","Conferences","10.1109/VISUAL.2004.13","50","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372178/","Flow Visualization","Vector Field","","Simplification","Segmentation","Clustering","Centroidal Voronoi tessellation","","","","","Data visualization","Computer vision","Data flow computing","Image segmentation","Displays","Noise shaping","Data mining","Statistical distributions","Mathematics","Convolution","29999","0-7803-8788-0","Print ISBN","Historical","0-7803-8788-0","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1372178","10-15 Oct. 2004","9449","IEEE Visualization 2004","2004","IEEE","54","43","Centroidal Voronoi tessellation based algorithms for vector fields visualization and segmentation"
"A common deficiency of discretized datasets is that detail beyond the resolution of the dataset has been irrecoverably lost. This lack of detail becomes immediately apparent once one attempts to zoom into the dataset and only recovers blur. We describe a method that generates the missing detail from any available and plausible high-resolution data, using texture synthesis. Since the detail generation process is guided by the underlying image or volume data and is designed to fill in plausible detail in accordance with the coarse structure and properties of the zoomed-in neighborhood, we refer to our method as constrained texture synthesis. Regular zooms become ""semantic zooms"", where each level of detail stems from a data source attuned to that resolution. We demonstrate our approach by a medical application - the visualization of a human liver - but its principles readily apply to any scenario, as long as data at all resolutions are available. We first present a 2D viewing application, called the ""virtual microscope"", and then extend our technique to 3D volumetric viewing.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372182/","LOCKED","1372182","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37280763200","1","Lujin Wang","37280763200","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273119700","2","K.

"Datasets of tens of gigabytes are becoming common in computational and experimental science. This development is driven by advances in imaging technology, producing detectors with growing resolutions, as well as availability of cheap processing power and memory capacity in commodity-based computing clusters. We describe the design of a visualization system that allows scientists to interactively explore large remote data sets in an efficient and flexible way. The system is broadly applicable and currently used by medical scientists conducting an osteoporosis research project. Human vertebral bodies are scanned using a high resolution microCT scanner producing scans of roughly 8 GB size each. All participating research groups require access to the centrally stored data. Due to the rich internal bone structure, scientists need to interactively explore the full dataset at coarse levels, as well as visualize subvolumes of interest at the highest resolution. Our solution is based on HDF5 and GridFTP. When accessing data remotely, the HDF5 data processing pipeline is modified to support efficient retrieval of subvolumes. We reduce the overall latency and optimize throughput by executing high-level operations on the remote side. The GridFTP protocol is used to pass the HDF5 requests to a customized server. The approach takes full advantage of local graphics hardware for rendering. Interactive visualization is accomplished using a background thread to access the datasets stored in a multiresolution format. A hierarchical volume tenderer provides seamless integration of high resolution details with low resolution overviews.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372216/","LOCKED","1372216","Sci.

"Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a magnetic resonance imaging method that can be used to measure local information about the structure of white matter within the human brain. Combining DTI data with the computational methods of MR tractography, neuroscientists can estimate the locations and sizes of nerve bundles (white matter pathways) that course through the human brain. Neuroscientists have used visualization techniques to better understand tractography data, but they often struggle with the abundance and complexity of the pathways. We describe a novel set of interaction techniques that make it easier to explore and interpret such pathways. Specifically, our application allows neuroscientists to place and interactively manipulate box-shaped regions (or volumes of interest) to selectively display pathways that pass through specific anatomical areas. A simple and flexible query language allows for arbitrary combinations of these queries using Boolean logic operators. Queries can be further restricted by numerical path properties such as length, mean fractional anisotropy, and mean curvature. By precomputing the pathways and their statistical properties, we obtain the speed necessary for interactive question-and-answer sessions with brain researchers. We survey some questions that researchers have been asking about tractography data and show how our system can be used to answer these questions efficiently.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372220/","LOCKED","1372220","Stanford Univ., CA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268691800","1","D.

"Most data used in the study of seafloor hydrothermal plumes consists of sonar (acoustic) scans and sensor readings. Visual data captures only a portion of the sonar data range due to the prohibitive cost and physical infeasibility of taking sufficient lighting and video equipment to such extreme depths. However, visual images are available from research dives and from the recent IMAX movie, volcanoes of the deep sea. In this application paper, we apply existing lighting models with forward scattering and light attenuation to the 3D sonar data in order to mimic the visual images available. These generated images are compared to existing visual images. This can help the geoscientists understand the relationship between these different data modalities and elucidate some of the mechanisms used to capture the data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372184/","LOCKED","1372184","Rutgers Univ., NJ, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282733800","1","K.

"Virtual prototyping is increasingly replacing real mock-ups and experiments in industrial product development. Part of this process is the simulation of structural and functional properties, which is in many cases based on finite element analysis (FEA). One prominent example from the automotive industry is the safety improvement resulting from crash worthiness simulations. A simulation model for this purpose usually consists of up to one million finite elements and is assembled from many parts, which are individually meshed out of their CAD representation. In order to accelerate the development cycle, simulation engineers want to be able to modify their FE models without going back to the CAD department. Furthermore, valid CAD models might even not be available in preliminary design stages. However, in contrast to CAD, there is a lack of tools that offer the possibility of modification and processing of finite element components while maintaining the properties relevant to the simulation. In this application paper we present interactive algorithms for intuitive and fast editing of FE models and appropriate visualization techniques to support engineers in understating these models. This includes new kinds of manipulators, feedback mechanisms and facilities for virtual reality and immersion at the workplace, e.g. autostereoscopic displays and haptic devices.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372218/","LOCKED","1372218","Visualization & Interactive Syst.

"Accurate estimation of vessel parameters is a prerequisite for automated visualization and analysis of healthy and diseased blood vessels. The objective of this research is to estimate the dimensions of lower extremity arteries, imaged by computed tomography (CT). These parameters are required to get a good quality visualization of healthy as well as diseased arteries using a visualization technique such as curved planar reformation (CPR). The vessel is modeled using an elliptical or cylindrical structure with specific dimensions, orientation and blood vessel mean density. The model separates two homogeneous regions: its inner side represents a region of density for vessels, and its outer side a region for background. Taking into account the point spread function (PSF) of a CT scanner, a function is modeled with a Gaussian kernel, in order to smooth the vessel boundary in the model. A new strategy for vessel parameter estimation is presented. It stems from vessel model and model parameter optimization by a nonlinear optimization procedure, i.e., the Levenberg-Marquardt technique. The method provides center location, diameter and orientation of the vessel as well as blood and background mean density values. The method is tested on synthetic data and real patient data with encouraging results.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372222/","LOCKED","1372222","Vienna Univ. of Technol., Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282579200","1","A.

"Many large scale physics-based simulations which take place on PC clusters or supercomputers produce huge amounts of data including vector fields. While these vector data such as electromagnetic fields, fluid flow fields, or particle paths can be represented by lines, the sheer number of the lines overwhelms the memory and computation capability of a high-end PC used for visualization. Further, very dense or intertwined lines, rendered with traditional visualization techniques, can produce unintelligible results with unclear depth relationships between the lines and no sense of global structure. Our approach is to apply a lighting model to the lines and sample them into an anisotropic voxel representation based on spherical harmonics as a preprocessing step. Then we evaluate and render these voxels for a given view using traditional volume rendering. For extremely large line based datasets, conversion to anisotropic voxels reduces the overall storage and rendering for O(n) lines to O(1) with a large constant that is still small enough to allow meaningful visualization of the entire dataset at nearly interactive rates on a single commodity PC.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372186/","LOCKED","1372186","Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, Menlo Park, CA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283639900","1","G.

"This work introduces importance-driven volume rendering as a novel technique for automatic focus and context display of volumetric data. Our technique is a generalization of cut-away views, which - depending on the viewpoint - remove or suppress less important parts of a scene to reveal more important underlying information. We automatize and apply this idea to volumetric data. Each part of the volumetric data is assigned an object importance, which encodes visibility priority. This property determines which structures should be readily discernible and which structures are less important. In those image regions, where an object occludes more important structures it is displayed more sparsely than in those areas where no occlusion occurs. Thus the objects of interest are clearly visible. For each object several representations, i.e., levels of sparseness, are specified. The display of an individual object may incorporate different levels of sparseness. The goal is to emphasize important structures and to maximize the information content in the final image. This work also discusses several possible schemes for level of sparseness specification and different ways how object importance can be composited to determine the final appearance of a particular object.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372190/","LOCKED","1372190","Inst. of Comput.

"Coloring higher order scientific data is problematic using standard linear methods as found in OpenGL. The visual results are inaccurate when there is a large scalar gradient over an element or when the scalar field is nonlinear. In addition to shading nonlinear data, last and accurate rendering of planar cuts through parametric elements can be implemented using programmable shaders on current graphics hardware. The intersection of a planar cut with geometrically curved volume elements can be rendered using a combination of selective refinement and programmable shaders. This hybrid algorithm also handles curved 2D planar triangles.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372224/","LOCKED","1372224","Aerosp.

"The physical interpretation of mathematical features of tensor fields is highly application-specific. Existing visualization methods for tensor fields only cover a fraction of the broad application areas. We present a visualization method tailored specifically to the class of tensor field exhibiting properties similar to stress and strain tensors, which are commonly encountered in geomechanics. Our technique is a global method that represents the physical meaning of these tensor fields with their central features: regions of compression or expansion. The method is based on two steps: first, we define a positive definite metric, with the same topological structure as the tensor field; second, we visualize the resulting metric. The eigenvector fields are represented using a texture-based approach resembling line integral convolution (LIC) methods. The eigenvalues of the metric are encoded in free parameters of the texture definition. Our method supports an intuitive distinction between positive and negative eigenvalues. We have applied our method to synthetic and some standard data sets, and ""real"" data from earth science and mechanical engineering application.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372188/","LOCKED","1372188","IDAV, California Univ., Davis, CA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282721800","1","I.

"Grid computing provides a challenge for visualization system designers. In this research, we evolve the dataflow concept to allow parts of the visualization process to be executed remotely in a secure and seamless manner. We see dataflow at three levels: an abstract specification of the intent of the visualization; a binding of these abstract modules to a specific software system; and then a binding of software to processing and other resources. We develop an XML application capable of describing visualization at the three levels. To complement this, we have implemented an extension to a popular visualization system, IRIS Explorer, which allows modules in a dataflow pipeline to run on a set of grid resources. For computational steering applications, we have developed a library that allows a visualization system front-end to connect to a simulation running remotely on a grid resource. We demonstrate the work in two applications: the dispersion of a pollutant under different wind conditions; and the solution of a challenging numerical problem in elastohydrodynamic lubrication.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372192/","LOCKED","1372192","Sch. of Comput., Leeds Univ., UK","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271754900","1","K.

"Computational simulation of time-varying physical processes is of fundamental importance for many scientific and engineering applications. Most frequently, time-varying simulations are performed over multiple spatial grids at discrete points in time. We investigate a new approach to time-varying simulation: spacetime discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods. The result of this simulation method is a simplicial tessellation of spacetime with per-element polynomial solutions for physical quantities such as strain, stress, and velocity. To provide accurate visualizations of the resulting solutions, we have developed a method for per-pixel evaluation of solution data on the GPU. We demonstrate the importance of per-pixel rendering versus simple linear interpolation for producing high quality visualizations. We also show that our system can accommodate reasonably large datasets - spacetime meshes containing up to 20 million tetrahedra are not uncommon in this domain.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372226/","LOCKED","1372226","Dept. of Comput.

"We propose a novel point-based approach to view dependent isosurface extraction. We introduce a fast visibility query system for the view dependent traversal, which exhibits moderate memory requirements. This technique allows for an interactive interrogation of the full visible woman dataset (1GB) at four to fifteen frames per second on a desktop computer. The point-based approach is built on an extraction scheme that classifies different sections of the isosurface into four categories, depending on the size of the geometry when projected onto the screen. In particular, we use points to represent small and subpixel triangles, as well as larger sections of the isosurface whose projection has subpixel size. To assign consistent and robust normals to individual points representing such regions, we propose to compute them during post processing of the extracted isosurface and provide the corresponding hardware implementation.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372230/","LOCKED","1372230","Sci.

"Quantitative techniques for visualization are critical to the successful analysis of both acquired and simulated scientific data. Many visualization techniques rely on indirect mappings, such as transfer functions, to produce the final imagery. In many situations, it is preferable and more powerful to express these mappings as mathematical expressions, or queries, that can then be directly applied to the data. We present a hardware-accelerated system that provides such capabilities and exploits current graphics hardware for portions of the computational tasks that would otherwise be executed on the CPU. In our approach, the direct programming of the graphics processor using a concise data parallel language, gives scientists the capability to efficiently explore and visualize data sets.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372194/","LOCKED","1372194","Advanced Comput.

"We introduce a novel span-triangle data structure, based on the span-space representation for isosurfaces. It stores all necessary cell information for dynamic manipulation of the isovalue in an efficient way. We have found that using our data structure in combination with point-based techniques, implemented on graphics hardware, effects in real-time rendering and exploration. Our extraction algorithm utilizes an incremental and progressive update scheme, enabling smooth interaction without significant latency. Moreover, the corresponding visualization pipeline is capable of processing large data sets by utilizing all three levels of memory: disk, system and graphics. We address practical usability in actual medical applications, achieving a new level of interactivity.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372228/","LOCKED","1372228","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38269932000","1","B. von Rymon-Lipinski","38269932000","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38277392600","2","N.

"New high-throughput proteomic techniques generate data faster than biologists can analyze it. Hidden within this massive and complex data are answers to basic questions about how cells function. The data afford an opportunity to take a global or systems approach studying whole proteomes comprising all the proteins in an organism. However, the tremendous size and complexity of the high-throughput data make it difficult to process and interpret. Existing tools for studying a few proteins at a time are not suitable for global analysis. Visualization provides powerful analysis capabilities for enormous, complex data at multiple resolutions. We developed a novel interactive visualization tool, PQuad, for the visual analysis of proteins and peptides identified from high-throughput data on biological samples. PQuad depicts the peptides in the context of their source protein and DNA, thereby integrating proteomic and genomic information. A wrapped line metaphor is applied across key resolutions of the data, from a compressed view of an entire chromosome to the actual nucleotide sequence. PQuad provides a difference visualization for comparing peptides from samples prepared under different experimental conditions. We describe the requirements for such a visual analysis tool, the design decisions, and the novel aspects of PQuad.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372232/","LOCKED","1372232","Pacific Northwest Nat.

"Vortex breakdowns and flow recirculation are essential phenomena in aeronautics where they appear as a limiting factor in the design of modern aircrafts. Because of the inherent intricacy of these features, standard flow visualization techniques typically yield cluttered depictions. The paper addresses the challenges raised by the visual exploration and validation of two CFD simulations involving vortex breakdown. To permit accurate and insightful visualization we propose a new approach that unfolds the geometry of the breakdown region by letting a plane travel through the structure along a curve. We track the continuous evolution of the associated projected vector field using the theoretical framework of parametric topology. To improve the understanding of the spatial relationship between the resulting curves and lines we use direct volume rendering and multidimensional transfer functions for the display of flow-derived scalar quantities. This enriches the visualization and provides an intuitive context for the extracted topological information. Our results offer clear, synthetic depictions that permit new insight into the structural properties of vortex breakdowns.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372196/","LOCKED","1372196","Utah Univ., Salt Lake City, UT, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282575100","1","X.

"We present the definition and computational algorithms for a new class of surfaces which are dual to the isosurface produced by the widely used marching cubes (MC) algorithm. These new isosurfaces have the same separating properties as the MC surfaces but they are comprised of quad patches that tend to eliminate the common negative aspect of poorly shaped triangles of the MC isosurfaces. Based upon the concept of this new dual operator, we describe a simple, but rather effective iterative scheme for producing smooth separating surfaces for binary, enumerated volumes which are often produced by segmentation algorithms. Both the dual surface algorithm and the iterative smoothing scheme are easily implemented.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372234/","LOCKED","1372234","Arizona Univ., Tucson, AZ, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283754100","1","G.M.

"We describe a new technique for fitting scattered point cloud data. Given a scattered point cloud of 3D data points and associated normal vectors, our new method produces an implicit volume model whose zero level isosurface interpolates the given points and associated normal vectors. We concentrate on certain application of these new volume modeling techniques. We take existing polygon mesh surfaces and use the present methods to construct implicit volume models for these surfaces. Implicit models allow for the application of Boolean operations on these surfaces through the techniques of constructive solid geometry. Also, standard wavelet and filter operators can be applied to the implicit volume model leading to effective smoothing and filtering algorithms, which are simple to implement.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372198/","LOCKED","1372198","Arizona State Univ., AZ, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283754100","1","G.M.

"This work presents an experimental immersive interface for designing DNA components for application in nanotechnology. While much research has been done on immersive visualization, this is one of the first systems to apply advanced interface techniques to a scientific design problem. This system uses tangible 3D input devices (tongs, a raygun, and a multipurpose handle tool) to create and edit a purely digital representation of DNA. The tangible controllers are associated with functions (not data) while a virtual display is used to render the model. This interface was built in collaboration with a research group investigating the design of DNA tiles. A user study shows that scientists find the immersive interface more satisfying than a 2D interface due to the enhanced understanding gained by directly interacting with molecules in 3D space.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372201/","LOCKED","1372201","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282570500","1","S.

"We present a fast, topology-preserving approach for isosurface simplification. The underlying concept behind our approach is to preserve the disconnected surface components in cells during isosurface simplification. We represent isosurface components in a novel representation, called enhanced cell, where each surface component in a cell is represented by a vertex and its connectivity information. A topology-preserving vertex clustering algorithm is applied to build a vertex octree. An enhanced dual contouring algorithm is applied to extract error-bounded multiresolution isosurfaces from the vertex octree while preserving the finest resolution isosurface topology. Cells containing multiple vertices are properly handled during contouring. Our approach demonstrates better results than existing octree-based simplification techniques.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372236/","LOCKED","1372236","Dept. of Comput.

"Multiperspective images are a useful way to visualize extended, roughly planar scenes such as landscapes or city blocks. However, constructing effective multiperspective images is something of an art. We describe an interactive system for creating multiperspective images composed of serially blended cross-slits images. Beginning with a sideways-looking video of the scene as might be captured from a moving vehicle, we allow the user to interactively specify a set of cross-slits cameras, possibly with gaps between them. In each camera, one of the slits is defined to be the camera path, which is typically horizontal, and the user is left to choose the second slit, which is typically vertical. The system then generates intermediate views between these cameras using a novel interpolation scheme, thereby producing a multiperspective image with no seams. The user can also choose the picture surface in space onto which viewing rays are projected, thereby establishing a parameterization for the image. We show how the choice of this surface can be used to create interesting visual effects. We demonstrate our system by constructing multiperspective images that summarize city blocks, including corners, blocks with deep plazas and other challenging urban situations.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372240/","LOCKED","1372240","Comput.

"While molecular visualization software has advanced over the years, today, most tools still operate on individual molecular structures with limited facility to manipulate large multicomponent complexes. We approach this problem by extending 3D image-based rendering via programmable graphics units, resulting in an order of magnitude speedup over traditional triangle-based rendering. By incorporating a biochemically sensitive level-of-detail hierarchy into our molecular representation, we communicate appropriate volume occupancy and shape while dramatically reducing the visual clutter that normally inhibits higher-level spatial comprehension. Our hierarchical, image based rendering also allows dynamically computed physical properties data (e.g. electrostatics potential) to be mapped onto the molecular surface, tying molecular structure to molecular function. Finally, we present another approach to interactive molecular exploration using volumetric and structural rendering in tandem to discover molecular properties that neither rendering mode alone could reveal. These visualization techniques are realized in a high-performance, interactive molecular exploration tool we call TexMol, short for Texture Molecular viewer.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372203/","LOCKED","1372203","Center for Computational Visualization, Texas Univ., Austin, TX, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282899200","1","Chandrajit Bajaj","37282899200","Center for Computational Visualization, Texas Univ., Austin, TX, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282578400","2","P.

"This work describes a method to visualize the thickness of curved thin objects. Given the MRI volume data of articular cartilage, medical doctors investigate pathological changes of the thickness. Since the tissue is very thin, it is impossible to reliably map the thickness information by direct volume rendering. Our idea is based on unfolding of such structures preserving their thickness. This allows to perform anisotropic geometrical operations (e.g., scaling the thickness). However, flattening of a curved structure implies a distortion of its surface. The distortion problem is alleviated through a focus-and-context minimization approach. Distortion is smallest close to a focal point which can be interactively selected by the user.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372238/","LOCKED","1372238","ICGA, Vienna Univ. of Technol., Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266257200","1","M.

In particular, we simulate airborne contaminant propagation in open environments characterised by sky-scrapers and deep urban canyons. Our approach is based on the multiple relaxation time lattice Boltzmann model (MRTLBM), which can efficiently handle complex boundary conditions such as buildings. In addition, we model thermal effects on the flow field using the hybrid thermal MRTLBM. Our approach can also accommodate readings from various sensors distributed in the environment and adapt the simulation accordingly. We accelerate the computation and efficiently render many buildings with small textures on the GPU. We render streamlines and the contaminant smoke with self-shadowing composited with the textured buildings.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372242/","LOCKED","1372242","Dept. of Comput.

"We present a novel surface reconstruction algorithm that can recover high-quality surfaces from noisy and defective data sets without any normal or orientation information. A set of new techniques is introduced to afford extra noise tolerability, robust orientation alignment, reliable outlier removal, and satisfactory feature recovery. In our algorithm, sample points are first organized by an octree. The points are then clustered into a set of monolithically singly-oriented groups. The inside/outside orientation of each group is determined through a robust voting algorithm. We locally fit an implicit quadric surface in each octree cell. The locally fitted implicit surfaces are then blended to produce a signed distance field using the modified Shepard's method. We develop sophisticated iterative fitting algorithms to afford improved noise tolerance both in topology recognition and geometry accuracy.

"Resampling is a frequent task in visualization and medical imaging. It occurs whenever images or volumes are magnified, rotated, translated, or warped. Resampling is also an integral procedure in the registration of multimodal datasets, such as CT, PET, and MRI, in the correction of motion artifacts in MRI, and in the alignment of temporal volume sequences in fMRI. It is well known that the quality of the resampling result depends heavily on the quality of the interpolation filter used. However, high-quality filters are rarely employed in practice due to their large spatial extents. We explore a new resampling technique that operates in the frequency-domain where high-quality filtering is feasible. Further, unlike previous methods of this kind, our technique is not limited to integer-ratio scaling factors, but can resample image and volume datasets at any rate. This would usually require the application of slow discrete Fourier transforms (DFT) to return the data to the spatial domain. We studied two methods that successfully avoid these delays: the chirp-z transform and the FFTW package. We also outline techniques to avoid the ringing artifacts that may occur with frequency-domain filtering. Thus, our method can achieve high-quality interpolation at speeds that are usually associated with spatial filters of far lower quality.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372173/","LOCKED","1372173","Comput.

For k = d = 2 we relate the measures to the set of critical points of one function restricted to the level sets of the other.

"We present a space leaping technique for accelerating volume rendering with very low space and run-time complexity. Our technique exploits the ray coherence during ray casting by using the distance a ray traverses in empty space to leap its neighboring rays. Our technique works with parallel as well as perspective volume rendering, does not require any preprocessing or 3D data structures, and is independent of the transfer function. Being an image-space technique, it is independent of the complexity of the data being rendered. It can be used to accelerate both time-coherent and noncoherent animation sequences.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372175/","LOCKED","1372175","Dept. of Comput.

"An important task in volume rendering is the visualization of boundaries between materials. This is typically accomplished using transfer functions that increase opacity based on a voxel's value and gradient. Lighting also plays a crucial role in illustrating surfaces. In this paper we present a multi-dimensional transfer function method for enhancing surfaces, not through the variation of opacity, but through the modification of surface shading. The technique uses a lighting transfer function that takes into account the distribution of values along a material boundary and features a novel interface for visualizing and specifying these transfer functions. With our method, the user is given a means of visualizing boundaries without modifying opacity, allowing opacity to be used for illustrating the thickness of homogeneous materials through the absorption of light.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372209/","LOCKED","1372209","California Univ., Davis, CA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282576300","1","E.B.

"Topological methods aim at the segmentation of a vector field into areas of different flow behavior. For 2D time-dependent vector fields, two such segmentations are possible: either concerning the behavior of stream lines, or of path lines. While stream line oriented topology is well established, we introduce path line oriented topology as a new visualization approach in this paper. As a contribution to stream line oriented topology we introduce new methods to detect global bifurcations like saddle connections and cyclic fold bifurcations. To get the path line oriented topology we segment the vector field into areas of attracting, repelling and saddle-like behavior of the path lines. We compare both kinds of topologies and apply them to a number of data sets.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372213/","LOCKED","1372213","Max-Planck-Inst. fur Inf., Saarbrucken, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266875400","1","H.

"We present a novel multiscale approach for flow visualization. We define a local alignment tensor that encodes a measure for alignment to the direction of a given flow field. This tensor induces an anisotropic differential operator on the flow domain, which is discretized with a standard finite element technique. The entries of the corresponding stiffness matrix represent the anisotropically weighted couplings of adjacent nodes of the domain mesh. We use an algebraic multigrid algorithm to generate a hierarchy of fine to coarse descriptions for the above coupling data. This hierarchy comprises a set of coarse grid nodes, a multiscale of basis functions and their corresponding supports. We use these supports to obtain a multilevel decomposition of the flow structure. Standard streamline icons are used to visualize this decomposition at any user-selected level of detail. The method provides a single framework for vector field decomposition independent on the domain dimension or mesh type. Applications are shown in 2D, for flow fields on curved surfaces, and for 3D volumetric flow fields.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372177/","LOCKED","1372177","Inst. for Numerical Simulation, Bonn Univ., Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282573500","1","M.

"We present a hardware-accelerated adaptive EWA (elliptical weighted average) volume splatting algorithm. EWA splatting combines a Gaussian reconstruction kernel with a low-pass image filter for high image quality without aliasing artifacts or excessive blurring. We introduce a novel adaptive filtering scheme to reduce the computational cost of EWA splatting. We show how this algorithm can be efficiently implemented on modern graphics processing units (GPUs). Our implementation includes interactive classification and fast lighting. To accelerate the rendering we store splat geometry and 3D volume data locally in GPU memory.

"An ideal visualization tool that has not been used before in studying the optical behavior of near-field apertures is three-dimensional vector field topology. The global view of the vector field structure is deduced by locating singularities (critical points) within the field and augmenting these points with nearby streamlines. We have used for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, three-dimensional topology to analyze the topological differences between a resonant C-shaped nano-aperture and various nonresonant conventional apertures. The topological differences between these apertures are related to the superiority in power throughput of the C-aperture versus conventional round and square sub-wavelength apertures. We demonstrate how topological visualization techniques provide significant insight into the energy enhancement mechanism of the C aperture, and also shed light on critical issues related to the interaction between multiple apertures located in close proximity to each other, which gives rise to cross-talk, for example as a function of distance. Topological techniques allow us to develop design rules for the geometry of these apertures and their desired spot sizes and brightness. The performance of various sub-wavelength apertures can also be compared quantitatively based on their topology. Since topological methods are generically applicable to tensor and vector fields, our approach can be readily extended to provide insight into the broader category of finite-difference-time-domain nano-photonics and nano-science problems.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372215/","LOCKED","1372215","Dept. of Phys., Stanford Univ., CA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37064962600","1","L.

"Determining the three-dimensional structure of distant astronomical objects is a challenging task, given that terrestrial observations provide only one viewpoint. For this task, bipolar planetary nebulae are interesting objects of study because of their pronounced axial symmetry due to fundamental physical processes. Making use of this symmetry constraint, we present a technique to automatically recover the axisymmetric structure of bipolar planetary nebulae from two-dimensional images. With GPU-based volume rendering driving a nonlinear optimization, we estimate the nebula's local emission density as a function of its radial and axial coordinates, and we recover the orientation of the nebula relative to Earth. The optimization refines the nebula model and its orientation by minimizing the differences between the rendered image and the original astronomical image. The resulting model enables realistic 3D visualizations of planetary nebulae, e.g. for educational purposes in planetarium shows. In addition, the recovered spatial distribution of the emissive gas allows validating computer simulation results of the astrophysical formation processes of planetary nebulae.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372183/","LOCKED","1372183","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273816400","1","M.

"This work describes the methods used to produce an interactive visualization of a 2 TB computational fluid dynamics (CFD) data set using particle tracing (streaklines). We use the method introduced by Bruckschen el al. (2001) that precomputes a large number of particles, stores them on disk using a space-filling curve ordering that minimizes seeks, then retrieves and displays the particles according to the user's command. We describe how the particle computation can be performed using a PC cluster, how the algorithm can be adapted to work with a multiblock curvilinear mesh, how scalars can be extracted and used to color the particles, and how the out-of-core visualization can be scaled to 293 billion particles while still achieving interactive performance on PC hardware. Compared to the earlier work, our data set size and total number of particles are an order of magnitude larger. We also describe a new compression technique that losslessly reduces the amount of particle storage by 41% and speeds the particle retrieval by about 20%.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372217/","LOCKED","1372217","NASA Ames Res.

"Accurate and reliable visualization of blood vessels is still a challenging problem, notably in the presence of morphologic changes resulting from atherosclerotic diseases.

We introduce the VesselGlyph as an abstract notation for novel focus & context visualization techniques of tubular structures such as contrast-medium enhanced arteries in CT-angiography (CTA). The proposed techniques combine direct volume rendering (DVR) and curved planar reformation (CPR) within a single image. The VesselGlyph consists of several regions where different rendering methods are used. The region type, the used visualization method and the region parameters depend on the distance from the vessel centerline and on viewing parameters as well. By selecting proper rendering techniques for different regions, vessels are depicted in a naturally looking and undistorted anatomic context. This may facilitate the diagnosis and treatment planning of patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease. In this paper we furthermore present a way of how to implement the proposed techniques in software and by means of modern 3D graphics accelerators.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372221/","LOCKED","1372221","Comm. for Sci.

"Traditional flow volumes construct an explicit geometrical or parametrical representation from the vector field. The geometry is updated interactively and then rendered using an unstructured volume rendering technique. Unless a detailed refinement of the flow volume is specified for the interior, information inside the underlying flow volume is lost in the linear interpolation. These disadvantages can be avoided and/or alleviated using an implicit flow model. An implicit flow is a scalar field constructed such that any point in the field is associated with a termination surface using an advection operator on the flow. We present two techniques, a slice-based three-dimensional texture mapping and an interval volume segmentation coupled with a tetrahedron projection-based renderer, to render implicit stream flows. In the first method, the implicit flow representation is loaded as a 3D texture and manipulated using a dynamic texture operation that allows the flow to be investigated interactively. In our second method, a geometric flow volume is extracted from the implicit flow using a high dimensional isocontouring or interval volume routine. This provides a very detailed flow volume or set of flow volumes that can easily change topology, while retaining accurate characteristics within the flow volume. The advantages and disadvantages of these two techniques are compared with traditional explicit flow volumes.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372185/","LOCKED","1372185","Dept. of Comput.

"An important challenge encountered during post-processing of finite element analyses is the visualizing of three-dimensional fields of real-valued second-order tensors. Namely, as finite element meshes become more complex and detailed, evaluation and presentation of the principal stresses becomes correspondingly problematic. In this paper, we describe techniques used to visualize simulations of perturbed in-situ stress fields associated with hypothetical salt bodies in the Gulf of Mexico. We present an adaptation of the Mohr diagram, a graphical paper and pencil method used by the material mechanics community for estimating coordinate transformations for stress tensors, as a new tensor glyph for dynamically exploring tensor variables within three-dimensional finite element models. This interactive glyph can be used as either a probe or a filter through brushing and linking.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372219/","LOCKED","1372219","Sandia Nat.

"Waves are a fundamental mechanism for conveying information in many physical problems. Direct visualization techniques are often used to display wave fronts. However, the information derived from such visualizations may not be as central to an investigation as an understanding of how the location, structure and time course of the wave change as key experimental parameters are varied. In experimental data, these questions are confounded by noise and incomplete data. Recognition of waves in networks of neurons is additionally complicated by the presence of long-range physical connections and recurrent excitation. This work applies visual techniques to analyze the structural details of waves in response data from the turtle visual cortex. We emphasize low-cost visualizations that allow comparisons across neural data sets and variables to reconstruct the choreography for a complex response.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372223/","LOCKED","1372223","Texas Univ., San Antonio, TX, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282602100","1","K.A.

"Effective visualization of vector fields relies on the ability to control the size and density of the underlying mapping to visual cues used to represent the field. In this paper we introduce the use of a reaction-diffusion model, already well known for its ability to form irregular spatio-temporal patters, to control the size, density, and placement of the vector field representation. We demonstrate that it is possible to encode vector field information (orientation and magnitude) into the parameters governing a reaction-diffusion model to form a spot pattern with the correct orientation, size, and density, creating an effective visualization. To encode direction we texture the spots using a light to dark fading texture. We also show that it is possible to use the reaction-diffusion model to visualize an additional scalar value, such as the uncertainty in the orientation of the vector field. An additional benefit of the reaction-diffusion visualization technique arises from its automatic density distribution. This benefit suggests using the technique to augment other vector visualization techniques. We demonstrate this utility by augmenting a LIC visualization with a reaction-diffusion visualization. Finally, the reaction-diffusion visualization method provides a technique that can be used for streamline and glyph placement.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372187/","LOCKED","1372187","Sci.

"Typically there is a high coherence in data values between neighboring time steps in an iterative scientific software simulation; this characteristic similarly contributes to a corresponding coherence in the visibility of volume blocks when these consecutive time steps are rendered. Yet traditional visibility culling algorithms were mainly designed for static data, without consideration of such potential temporal coherency. We explore the use of temporal occlusion coherence (TOC) to accelerate visibility culling for time-varying volume rendering. In our algorithm, the opacity of volume blocks is encoded by means of plenoptic opacity functions (POFs). A coherence-based block fusion technique is employed to coalesce time-coherent data blocks over a span of time steps into a single, representative block. Then POFs need only be computed for these representative blocks. To quickly determine the subvolumes that do not require updates in their visibility status for each subsequent time step, a hierarchical ""TOC tree"" data structure is constructed to store the spans of coherent time steps. To achieve maximal culling potential, while remaining conservative, we have extended our previous POP into an optimized POP (OPOP) encoding scheme for this specific scenario. To test our general TOC and OPOF approach, we have designed a parallel time-varying volume rendering algorithm accelerated by visibility culling. Results from experimental runs on a 32-processor cluster confirm both the effectiveness and scalability of our approach.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372191/","LOCKED","1372191","Oak Ridge State Lab., Ohio State Univ., Columbus, OH, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279695300","1","Jinzhu Gao","37279695300","Oak Ridge State Lab., Ohio State Univ., Columbus, OH, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279493500","2","Han-Wei Shen","37279493500","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37281262900","3","Jian Huang","37281262900","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282739200","4","J.A.

"A new multiple resolution volume rendering method for finite element analysis (FEA) data is presented. Our method is composed of three stages: in the first stage, the Gauss points of the FEA cells are calculated. The function values, gradients, diffusions, and influence scopes of the Gauss points are computed. By representing the Gauss points as graph vertices and connecting adjacent Gauss points with edges, an adjacency graph is created. The adjacency graph is used to represent the FEA data in the subsequent computation. In the second stage, a hierarchical structure is established upon the adjacency graph. Any two neighboring vertices with similar function values are merged into a new vertex. The similarity is measured by using a user-defined threshold. Consequently, a new adjacency graph is constructed. Then the threshold is increased, and the graph reduction is triggered again to generate another adjacency graph. By repeating the processing, multiple adjacency graphs are computed, and a level of detail (LoD) representation of the FEA data is established. In the third stage, the LoD structure is rendered by using a splatting method. At first, a level of adjacency graph is selected by users. The graph vertices arc sorted based on their visibility orders and projected onto the image plane in back-to-front order. Billboards are used to render the vertices in the projection. The function values, gradients, and influence scopes of the vertices are utilized to decide the colors, opacities, orientations, and shapes of the billboards. The billboards are then modulated with texture maps to generate the footprints of the vertices. Finally, these footprints are composited to produce the volume rendering image.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372225/","LOCKED","1372225","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Nat.

"We present a novel approach for interactive view-dependent rendering of massive models. Our algorithm combines view-dependent simplification, occlusion culling, and out-of-core rendering. We represent the model as a clustered hierarchy of progressive meshes (CHPM). We use the cluster hierarchy for coarse-grained selective refinement and progressive meshes for fine-grained local refinement. We present an out-of-core algorithm for computation of a CHPM that includes cluster decomposition, hierarchy generation, and simplification. We make use of novel cluster dependencies in preprocess to generate crack-free, drastic simplifications at runtime. The clusters are used for occlusion culling and out-of-core rendering. We add a frame of latency to the rendering pipeline to fetch newly visible clusters from the disk and to avoid stalls. The CHPM reduces the refinement cost for view-dependent rendering by more than an order of magnitude as compared to a vertex hierarchy. We have implemented our algorithm on a desktop PC. We can render massive CAD, isosurface, and scanned models, consisting of tens or a few hundreds of millions of triangles at 10-35 frames per second with little loss in image quality.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372189/","LOCKED","1372189","Dept. of Comput.

"We present a system for enhancing observation of user interactions in virtual environments. In particular, we focus on analyzing behavior patterns in the popular team-based first-person perspective game Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory. This game belongs to a genre characterized by two moderate-sized teams (usually 6 to 12 players each) competing over a set of objectives. Our system allows spectators to visualize global features such as large-scale behaviors and team strategies, as opposed to the limited, local view that traditional spectating modes provide. We also add overlay visualizations of semantic information related to the action that might be important to a spectator in order to reduce the information overload that plagues traditional overview visualizations. These overlays can visualize information about abstract concepts such as player distribution over time and areas of intense combat activity, and also highlight important features like player paths, fire coverage, etc. This added information allows spectators to identify important game events more easily and reveals large-scale player behaviors that might otherwise be overlooked.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372193/","LOCKED","1372193","Virginia Univ., Charlottesville, VA, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282720500","1","N.

"We present a novel approach to interactive visualization and exploration of large unstructured tetrahedral meshes. These massive 3D meshes are used in mission-critical CFD and structural mechanics simulations, and typically sample multiple field values on several millions of unstructured grid points. Our method relies on the preprocessing of the tetrahedral mesh to partition it into nonconvex boundaries and internal fragments that are subsequently encoded into compressed multiresolution data representations. These compact hierarchical data structures are then adaptively rendered and probed in real-time on a commodity PC. Our point-based rendering algorithm, which is inspired by QSplat, employs a simple but highly efficient splatting technique that guarantees interactive frame-rates regardless of the size of the input mesh and the available rendering hardware. It furthermore allows for real-time probing of the volumetric data-set through constructive solid geometry operations as well as interactive editing of color transfer functions for an arbitrary number of field values. Thus, the presented visualization technique allows end-users for the first time to interactively render and explore very large unstructured tetrahedral meshes on relatively inexpensive hardware.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372227/","LOCKED","1372227","Linkoping Inst. of Technol., Sweden","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284192900","1","K.

"We explore techniques to detect and visualize features in data from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Although the techniques proposed are general, we focus on silicon (Si) atomic systems. The first set of methods use 3D location of atoms. Defects are detected and categorized using local operators and statistical modeling. Our second set of exploratory techniques employ electron density data. This data is visualized to glean the defects. We describe techniques to automatically detect the salient isovalues for isosurface extraction and designing transfer functions. We compare and contrast the results obtained from both sources of data. Essentially, we find that the methods of defect (feature) detection are at least as robust as those based on the exploration of electron density for Si systems.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372231/","LOCKED","1372231","Dept. of Comput.

"Vorticity is the quantity used to describe the creation, transformation and extinction of vortices. It is present not only in vortices but also in shear flow. Especially in ducted flows, most of the overall vorticity is usually contained in the boundary layer. When a vortex develops from the boundary layer, this can be described by transport of vorticity. For a better understanding of a flow it is therefore of interest to examine vorticity in all of its different roles. The goal of this application study was not primarily the visualization of vortices but of vorticity distribution and its role in vortex phenomena. The underlying industrial case is a design optimization for a Pelton turbine. An important industrial objective is to improve the quality of the water jets driving the runner. Jet quality is affected mostly by vortices originating in the distributor ring. For a better understanding of this interrelation, it is crucial to not only visualize these vortices but also to analyze the mechanisms of their creation. We used various techniques for the visualization of vorticity, including field lines and modified isosurfaces.

"We propose an interpolating refinement method for two- and three-dimensional scalar fields defined on hexahedral grids. Iterative fairing of the underlying contours (isosurfaces) provides the function values of new grid points. Our method can be considered as a nonlinear variational subdivision scheme for volumes. It can be applied locally for adaptive mesh refinement in regions of high geometric complexity. We use our scheme to increase the quality of low-resolution data sets and to reduce interpolation artifacts in texture-based volume rendering.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372229/","LOCKED","1372229","TU Kaiserslautern, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282067000","1","M.

"We present an efficient algorithm to mesh the macromolecules surface model represented by the skin surface defined by Edelsbrunner. Our algorithm overcomes several challenges residing in current surface meshing methods. First, we guarantee the mesh quality with a provable lower bound of 21/spl deg/ on its minimum angle. Second, we ensure the triangulation is homeomorphic to the original surface. Third, we improve the efficiency of constructing the restricted Delaunay triangulation (RDT) of smooth surfaces. We achieve this by constructing the RDT using the advancing front method without computing the Delaunay tetrahedrization of the sample points on the surfaces. The difficulty of handling the front collision problem is tackled by employing the Morse theory. In particular, we construct the Morse-Smale complex to simplify the topological changes of the front. Our implementation results suggest that the algorithm decrease the time of generating high quality homeomorphic skin mesh from hours to a few minutes.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372233/","LOCKED","1372233","Sch. of Comput., Nat.

"Feature detection in flow fields is a well-researched area, but practical application is often difficult due to the numerical complexity of the algorithms preventing interactive use and due to noise in experimental or high-resolution simulation data sets. We present an integrated system that provides interactive denoising, vortex detection, and visualisation of vector data on Cartesian grids. All three major phases are implemented in such a way that the system runs completely on a modern GPU once the vector field is downloaded into graphics memory. The application aspect of our paper is twofold. First, we show how recently presented, prototypical GPU-based algorithms for filtering, numerical computation, and volume rendering can be combined into one productive system by handling all idiosyncrasies of a chosen graphics card. Second, we demonstrate that the significant speedup achieved compared to an optimized software implementation now allows interactive exploration of characteristic structures in turbulent flow fields.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1372197/","LOCKED","1372197","Inst. of Visualization & Interactive Syst., Stuttgart Univ., Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267809900","1","S.

"Advances in graphics hardware and rendering methods are shaping the future of visualization. For example, programmable graphics processors are redefining the traditional visualization cycle. In some cases it is now possible to run the computational simulation and associated visualization side-by-side on the same chip. Moreover, global illumination and non-photorealistic effects promise to deliver imagery which enables greater insight into high resolution, multivariate, and higher-dimensional data. The panelists will offer distinct viewpoints on the direction of future graphics hardware and its potential impact on visualization, and on the nature of advanced visualizationrelated tools and techniques. Presentation of these viewpoints will be followed by audience participation in the form of a question and answer period moderated by the panel organizer.","","EPHEMERA","1372245","University of Texas at Austin","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37269399700","1","G.

"The evolution of computational science over the last decade has resulted in a dramatic increase in raw problem solving capabilities. This growth has given rise to advances in scientific and engineering simulations that have put a high demand on tools for high-performance large-scale data exploration and analysis. These simulations have the potential to generate large amounts of data. Humans, however are relatively poor at gaining insight from raw numerical data, and as a result, have used visualization as a tool for understanding, interpreting and exploring data of all types and sizes. Allowing for efficient visual explorations of data, however, requires that the ratio of knowledge gained versus the cost of the visualization be maximized. This, in turn, mandates the integration of principles from human perception. Understanding perception as it relates to visualization requires that we understand not only the biology of the human visual system, but principles from vision theory, and perceptual psychology as well. This panel is the result of bringing together practioners and researchers from a broad spectrum of interests relating to the ability to maximize the amount of information that is effectively perceived from a given visualization. Position statements will be given by researchers interested in perceptual psychology and the perception of natural images, integrating art and design principles, non-photorealistic rendering techniques, and the use of global illumination methods to provide benefical perceptual cues.","","EPHEMERA","1372244","University of Texas at Austin","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282571800","1","K.

"Scientific Visualization (SciVis) has evolved past the point where one undergraduate course can cover all of the necessary topics. So the question becomes ""how do we teach SciVis to this generation of students?"" Some examples of current courses are: A graduate Computer Science (CS) course that prepares the next generation of SciVis researchers. An undergraduate CS course that prepares the future software architects/developers of packages such as vtk, vis5D and AVS. A class that teaches students how to do SciVis with existing software packages and how to deal with the lack of interoperability between those packages (via either a CS service course or a supercomputing center training course). An inter-disciplinary course designed to prepare computer scientists to work with the ""real"" scientists (via either a CS or Computational Science course). In this panel, we will discuss these types of courses and the advantages and disadvantages of each. We will also talk about some issues that you have probably encountered at your university: How do we keep the graphics/vis-oriented students from going to industry? How does SciVis fit in with evolving Computational Science programs? Is SciVis destined to be a service course at most universities? How do we deal with the diverse backgrounds of students that need SciVis?","","EPHEMERA","1372246","University of Alaska Fairbanks","","1","J.D.
