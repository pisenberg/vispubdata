In many instances it is possible to observe both input parameters and system outputs, and characterize the system as a high-dimensional function. Such data sets arise, for instance, in large numerical simulations, as energy landscapes in optimization problems, or in the analysis of image data relating to biological or medical parameters. This paper proposes an approach to analyze and visualizing such data sets. The proposed method combines topological and geometric techniques to provide interactive visualizations of discretely sampled high-dimensional scalar fields. The method relies on a segmentation of the parameter space using an approximate Morse-Smale complex on the cloud of point samples. For each crystal of the Morse-Smale complex, a regression of the system parameters with respect to the output yields a curve in the parameter space. The result is a simplified geometric representation of the Morse-Smale complex in the high dimensional input domain. Finally, the geometric representation is embedded in 2D, using dimension reduction, to provide a visualization platform. The geometric properties of the regression curves enable the visualization of additional information about each crystal such as local and global shape, width, length, and sampling densities. The method is illustrated on several synthetic examples of two dimensional functions. Two use cases, using data sets from the UCI machine learning repository, demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach on real data. Finally, in collaboration with domain experts the proposed method is applied to two scientific challenges. The analysis of parameters of climate simulations and their relationship to predicted global energy flux and the concentrations of chemical species in a combustion simulation and their integration with temperature.","article_number":"5613467","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613467","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613467/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613467/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"1271","end_page":"1280","citing_paper_count":61,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1408,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Crystals","Manifolds","Approximation methods","Data visualization","Kernel","Geometry","Concrete"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Morse theory","High-dimensional visualization","Morse-Smale complex"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.193","title":"SignalLens: Focus+Context Applied to Electronic Time Series","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":2,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Agilent Laboratories, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37587984100","id":37587984100,"full_name":"Robert Kincaid","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Agilent Laboratories, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Electronic test and measurement systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated in order to match the increased complexity and ultra-high speed of the devices under test. A key feature in many such instruments is a vastly increased capacity for storage of digital signals. Storage of $10^9$ time points or more is now possible. At the same time, the typical screens on such measurement devices are relatively small. Therefore, these instruments can only render an extremely small fraction of the complete signal at any time. SignalLens uses a Focus+Context approach to provide a means of navigating to and inspecting low-level signal details in the context of the entire signal trace. This approach provides a compact visualization suitable for embedding into the small displays typically provided by electronic measurement instruments. We further augment this display with computed tracks which display time-aligned computed properties of the signal. By combining and filtering these computed tracks it is possible to easily and quickly find computationally detected features in the data which are often obscured by the visual compression required to render the large data sets on a small screen. Further, these tracks can be viewed in the context of the entire signal trace as well as visible high-level signal features. Several examples using real-world electronic measurement data are presented, which demonstrate typical use cases and the effectiveness of the design.","article_number":"5613426","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613426","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613426/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613426/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"900","end_page":"907","citing_paper_count":45,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":1040,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Lenses","Context","Time series analysis","Navigation","Visualization","Instruments","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Focus+Context","Lens","Test and Measurement","Electronic Signal","Signal Processing"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.173","title":"IRIS: Illustrative Rendering for Integral Surfaces","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":3,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Kaiserslautern, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37587428300","id":37587428300,"full_name":"Mathias Hummel","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Kaiserslautern, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Data Analysis and Visualization, University of California, Davis, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282573700","id":37282573700,"full_name":"Christoph Garth","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Data Analysis and Visualization, University of California, Davis, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Data Analysis and Visualization, University of California, Davis, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282068700","id":37282068700,"full_name":"Bernd Hamann","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institute of Data Analysis and Visualization, University of California, Davis, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Kaiserslautern, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282578800","id":37282578800,"full_name":"Hans Hagen","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Kaiserslautern, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Institute of Data Analysis and Visualization, University of California, Davis, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267811400","id":37267811400,"full_name":"Kenneth I.

However, these surfaces can be visually complex and exhibit difficult geometric properties, owing to strong stretching, shearing and folding of the flow from which they are derived. Many techniques for non-photorealistic rendering have been presented previously. It is, however, unclear how these techniques can be applied to integral surfaces. In this paper, we examine how transparency and texturing techniques can be used with integral surfaces to convey both shape and directional information. We present a rendering pipeline that combines these techniques aimed at faithfully and accurately representing integral surfaces while improving visualization insight.

Current techniques based on pre-integrated direct volume rendering approximate the volume rendering integral by ignoring non-linear gradient variations between front and back samples, which might result in cumulated shading errors when gradient variations are important and / or when the illumination function features high frequencies. In this paper, we explore a simple approach for pre-integrated volume rendering with non-linear gradient interpolation between front and back samples. We consider that the gradient smoothly varies along a quadratic curve instead of a segment in-between consecutive samples. This not only allows us to compute more accurate shaded pre-integrated look-up tables, but also allows us to more efficiently process shading amplifying effects, based on gradient filtering. An interesting property is that the pre-integration tables we use remain two-dimensional as for usual pre-integrated classification. We conduct experiments using a full hardware approach with the Blinn-Phong illumination model as well as with a non-photorealistic illumination model.","article_number":"5613490","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613490","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613490/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613490/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"1487","end_page":"1494","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":538,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Interpolation","Rendering (computer graphics)","Lighting","Mathematical model","Niobium","Computational modeling","Equations"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["direct volume rendering","pre-integration","gradient interpolation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.221","title":"Volumetric Modeling in Laser BPH Therapy Simulation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":6,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273740800","id":37273740800,"full_name":"Nan Zhang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Minnesota, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37599791400","id":37599791400,"full_name":"Xiangmin Zhou","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Minnesota, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592889500","id":37592889500,"full_name":"Yunhe Shen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Minnesota, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37587454000","id":37587454000,"full_name":"Robert Sweet","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Minnesota, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce a novel application of volume modeling techniques on laser Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) therapy simulation.

In this paper, we systematically review the design space of this emerging class of visualizations. Drawing on case studies from news media to visualization research, we identify distinct genres of narrative visualization. We characterize these design differences, together with interactivity and messaging, in terms of the balance between the narrative flow intended by the author (imposed by graphical elements and the interface) and story discovery on the part of the reader (often through interactive exploration).

The members of these ensembles are individual simulations with either slightly perturbed initial conditions or different model parameterizations, or occasionally both. Multi-member ensemble output is usually large, multivariate, and challenging to interpret interactively. Forecast meteorologists are interested in understanding the uncertainties associated with numerical weather prediction; specifically variability between the ensemble members. Currently, visualization of ensemble members is mostly accomplished through spaghetti plots of a single midtroposphere pressure surface height contour. In order to explore new uncertainty visualization methods, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was used to create a 48-hour, 18 member parameterization ensemble of the 13 March 1993 \"Superstorm\". A tool was designed to interactively explore the ensemble uncertainty of three important weather variables: water-vapor mixing ratio, perturbation potential temperature, and perturbation pressure. Uncertainty was quantified using individual ensemble member standard deviation, inter-quartile range, and the width of the 95% confidence interval. Bootstrapping was employed to overcome the dependence on normality in the uncertainty metrics. A coordinated view of ribbon and glyph-based uncertainty visualization, spaghetti plots, iso-pressure colormaps, and data transect plots was provided to two meteorologists for expert evaluation. They found it useful in assessing uncertainty in the data, especially in finding outliers in the ensemble run and therefore avoiding the WRF parameterizations that lead to these outliers. Additionally, the meteorologists could identify spatial regions where the uncertainty was significantly high, allowing for identification of poorly simulated storm environments and physical interpretation of these model issues.","article_number":"5613483","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613483","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613483/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613483/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"1421","end_page":"1430","citing_paper_count":177,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2822,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty","Data visualization","Weather forecasting","Numerical models","Atmospheric modeling","Predictive models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty visualization","weather ensemble","geographic/geospatial visualization","glyph-based techniques","timevarying data","qualitative evaluation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.162","title":"Graphical Perception of Multiple Time Series","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":9,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399152800","id":37399152800,"full_name":"Waqas Javed","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590945700","id":37590945700,"full_name":"Bryan McDonnel","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295438200","id":37295438200,"full_name":"Niklas Elmqvist","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Line graphs have been the visualization of choice for temporal data ever since the days of William Playfair (1759-1823), but realistic temporal analysis tasks often include multiple simultaneous time series.

On the other hand, shared-space techniques--like standard line graphs--are typically more efficient for comparisons over smaller visual spans where the impact of overlap and clutter is reduced.","article_number":"5613429","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613429","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613429/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613429/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"927","end_page":"934","citing_paper_count":160,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":3591,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Time series analysis","Visualization","Data visualization","Clutter","Pixel","Image color analysis","Training"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["line graphs","braided graphs","horizon graphs","small multiples","stacked graphs","evaluation","design guidelines"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.164","title":"How Information Visualization Novices Construct Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":10,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Victoria, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37322138200","id":37322138200,"full_name":"Lars Grammel","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Victoria, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Victoria, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275861300","id":37275861300,"full_name":"Melanie Tory","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Victoria, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Victoria, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268043300","id":37268043300,"full_name":"Margaret-Anne Storey","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Victoria, Canada"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"It remains challenging for information visualization novices to rapidly construct visualizations during exploratory data analysis. We conducted an exploratory laboratory study in which information visualization novices explored fictitious sales data by communicating visualization specifications to a human mediator, who rapidly constructed the visualizations using commercial visualization software. We found that three activities were central to the iterative visualization construction process: data attribute selection, visual template selection, and visual mapping specification. The major barriers faced by the participants were translating questions into data attributes, designing visual mappings, and interpreting the visualizations. Partial specification was common, and the participants used simple heuristics and preferred visualizations they were already familiar with, such as bar, line and pie charts. We derived abstract models from our observations that describe barriers in the data exploration process and uncovered how information visualization novices think about visualization specifications. Our findings support the need for tools that suggest potential visualizations and support iterative refinement, that provide explanations and help with learning, and that are tightly integrated into tool support for the overall visual analytics process.","article_number":"5613431","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613431","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613431/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613431/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"943","end_page":"952","citing_paper_count":141,"citing_patent_count":8,"download_count":3626,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Decision support systems","Visualization","IEEE Computer Society"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Empirical study","visualization","visualization construction","visual analytics","visual mapping","novices"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.129","title":"A Visual Backchannel for Large-Scale Events","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":11,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Calgary, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590950400","id":37590950400,"full_name":"Marian Dörk","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Calgary, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"IBM Research Division, IBM Thomas J.

Microblogging communities, such as Twitter, are increasingly used as digital backchannels for timely exchange of brief comments and impressions during political speeches, sport competitions, natural disasters, and other large events. Currently, shared updates are typically displayed in the form of a simple list, making it difficult to get an overview of the fast-paced discussions as it happens in the moment and how it evolves over time. In contrast, our Visual Backchannel design provides an evolving, interactive, and multi-faceted visual overview of large-scale ongoing conversations on Twitter. To visualize a continuously updating information stream, we include visual saliency for what is happening now and what has just happened, set in the context of the evolving conversation. As part of a fully web-based coordinated-view system we introduce Topic Streams, a temporally adjustable stacked graph visualizing topics over time, a People Spiral representing participants and their activity, and an Image Cloud encoding the popularity of event photos by size. Together with a post listing, these mutually linked views support cross-filtering along topics, participants, and time ranges. We discuss our design considerations, in particular with respect to evolving visualizations of dynamically changing data. Initial feedback indicates significant interest and suggests several unanticipated uses.","article_number":"5613451","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613451","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613451/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613451/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"1129","end_page":"1138","citing_paper_count":137,"citing_patent_count":3,"download_count":1844,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Twitter","Data visualization","Shape","Context","Real time systems","Streaming media"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["backchannel","information visualization","events","multiple views","microblogging","information retrieval","World Wide Web"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.177","title":"Mental Models, Visual Reasoning and Interaction in Information Visualization: A Top-down Perspective","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":12,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Interactive Computing and the GVU Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592993600","id":37592993600,"full_name":"Zhicheng Liu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Interactive Computing and the GVU Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Interactive Computing and the GVU Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267736900","id":37267736900,"full_name":"John Stasko","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Interactive Computing and the GVU Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Although previous research has suggested that examining the interplay between internal and external representations can benefit our understanding of the role of information visualization (InfoVis) in human cognitive activities, there has been little work detailing the nature of internal representations, the relationship between internal and external representations and how interaction is related to these representations.

However, since tag clouds do not explicitly represent trends or support comparisons, the cognitive demands placed on the person for perceiving trends in multiple tag clouds are high. In this paper, we introduce SparkClouds, which integrate sparklines into a tag cloud to convey trends between multiple tag clouds.

Venn and Euler style diagrams are a common visual representation of such set membership where the data elements are represented by labels or glyphs and sets are indicated by boundaries surrounding their members. Generating such diagrams automatically such that set regions do not intersect unless the corresponding sets have a non-empty intersection is a difficult problem. Further, it may be impossible in some cases if regions are required to be continuous and convex. Several approaches exist to draw such set regions using more complex shapes, however, the resulting diagrams can be difficult to interpret. In this paper we present two novel approaches for simplifying a complex collection of intersecting sets into a strict hierarchy that can be more easily automatically arranged and drawn (Figure 1). In the first approach, we use compact rectangular shapes for drawing each set, attempting to improve the readability of the set intersections. In the second approach, we avoid drawing intersecting set regions by duplicating elements belonging to multiple sets. We compared both of our techniques to the traditional non-convex region technique using five readability tasks. Our results show that the compact rectangular shapes technique was often preferred by experimental subjects even though the use of duplications dramatically improves the accuracy and performance time for most of our tasks. In addition to general set representation our techniques are also applicable to visualization of networks with intersecting clusters of nodes.","article_number":"5613447","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613447","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613447/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613447/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"1090","end_page":"1099","citing_paper_count":99,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":1288,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Shape","Layout","Complexity theory","Visualization","Data visualization","Social network services","Semantics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Information Visualization","Euler diagrams","Set Visualization","Graph Visualization."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.132","title":"An Information-theoretic Framework for Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":16,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Swansea University, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37280982800","id":37280982800,"full_name":"Min Chen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Swansea University, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Ruprecht-Karls-University Heidelberg","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087368182","id":37087368182,"full_name":"Heike Jäenicke","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Ruprecht-Karls-University Heidelberg"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this paper, we examine whether or not information theory can be one of the theoretic frameworks for visualization.

While currently ignored by most visualization models, this translation entails a loss of information and the introduction of a number of artifacts that can be useful, (e.g., aggregation, structures) or distracting (e.g., over-plotting, clutter) for the analysis. This phenomenon is observed in parallel coordinates, where overlapping lines between adjacent axes form distinct patterns, representing the relation between variables they connect. However, even for a small number of dimensions, the challenge is to effectively convey the relationships for all combinations of dimensions. The size of the dataset and a large number of dimensions only add to the complexity of this problem. To address these issues, we propose Pargnostics, parallel coordinates diagnostics, a model based on screen-space metrics that quantify the different visual structures. Pargnostics metrics are calculated for pairs of axes and take into account the resolution of the display as well as potential axis inversions. Metrics include the number of line crossings, crossing angles, convergence, overplotting, etc. To construct a visualization view, the user can pick from a ranked display showing pairs of coordinate axes and the structures between them, or examine all possible combinations of axes at once in a matrix display. Picking the best axes layout is an NP-complete problem in general, but we provide a way of automatically optimizing the display according to the user's preferences based on our metrics and model.","article_number":"5613439","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613439","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613439/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613439/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"1017","end_page":"1026","citing_paper_count":94,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1101,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Measurement","Data visualization","Histograms","Clutter","Optimization","Visualization","Pixel"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Parallel Coordinates","metrics","display optimization","visualization models."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.131","title":"An Information-Theoretic Framework for Flow Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":19,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Ohio State Uinversity, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37598369700","id":37598369700,"full_name":"Lijie Xu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Ohio State Uinversity, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Ohio State Uinversity, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403060100","id":37403060100,"full_name":"Teng-Yok Lee","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Ohio State Uinversity, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Ohio State Uinversity, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279493500","id":37279493500,"full_name":"Han-Wei Shen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Ohio State Uinversity, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The process of visualization can be seen as a visual communication channel where the input to the channel is the raw data, and the output is the result of a visualization algorithm. From this point of view, we can evaluate the effectiveness of visualization by measuring how much information in the original data is being communicated through the visual communication channel. In this paper, we present an information-theoretic framework for flow visualization with a special focus on streamline generation. In our framework, a vector field is modeled as a distribution of directions from which Shannon's entropy is used to measure the information content in the field. The effectiveness of the streamlines displayed in visualization can be measured by first constructing a new distribution of vectors derived from the existing streamlines, and then comparing this distribution with that of the original data set using the conditional entropy. The conditional entropy between these two distributions indicates how much information in the original data remains hidden after the selected streamlines are displayed. The quality of the visualization can be improved by progressively introducing new streamlines until the conditional entropy converges to a small value. We describe the key components of our framework with detailed analysis, and show that the framework can effectively visualize 2D and 3D flow data.","article_number":"5613461","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613461","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613461/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613461/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"1216","end_page":"1224","citing_paper_count":94,"citing_patent_count":2,"download_count":1589,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Entropy","Histograms","Data visualization","Information theory","Three dimensional displays","Visualization","Streaming media"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Flow field visualization","information theory","streamline generation."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.199","title":"Superquadric Glyphs for Symmetric Second-Order Tensors","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":20,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Computation Institute, University of Chicago, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606352800","id":37606352800,"full_name":"Thomas Schultz","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, Computation Institute, University of Chicago, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Computation Institute, University of Chicago, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282742400","id":37282742400,"full_name":"Gordon L.

The utility of displaying tensor field samples has driven the development of visualization techniques that encode the tensor shape and orientation into the geometry of a tensor glyph. With some exceptions, these methods work only for positive-definite tensors (i.e. having positive eigenvalues, such as diffusion tensors). We expand the scope of tensor glyphs to all symmetric second-order tensors in two and three dimensions, gracefully and unambiguously depicting any combination of positive and negative eigenvalues. We generalize a previous method of superquadric glyphs for positive-definite tensors by drawing upon a larger portion of the superquadric shape space, supplemented with a coloring that indicates the tensor's quadratic form. We show that encoding arbitrary eigenvalue sign combinations requires design choices that differ fundamentally from those in previous work on traceless tensors (arising in the study of liquid crystals). Our method starts with a design of 2-D tensor glyphs guided by principles of symmetry and continuity, and creates 3-D glyphs that include the 2-D glyphs in their axis-aligned cross-sections. A key ingredient of our method is a novel way of mapping from the shape space of three-dimensional symmetric second-order tensors to the unit square. We apply our new glyphs to stress tensors from mechanics, geometry tensors and Hessians from image analysis, and rate-of-deformation tensors in computational fluid dynamics.","article_number":"5613502","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613502","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613502/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613502/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"1595","end_page":"1604","citing_paper_count":89,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":826,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Tensile stress","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Shape","Visualization","Geometry","Data visualization","Image color analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Tensor Glyphs","Stress Tensors","Rate-of-Deformation Tensors","Geometry Tensors","Glyph Design"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.190","title":"Result-Driven Exploration of Simulation Parameter Spaces for Visual Effects Design","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":21,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"GrUVi Graphics, Usability, and Visualization Laboratory, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37265895700","id":37265895700,"full_name":"Stefan Bruckner","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["GrUVi Graphics, Usability, and Visualization Laboratory, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"GrUVi Graphics, Usability, and Visualization Laboratory, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275858700","id":37275858700,"full_name":"Torsten Möller","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["GrUVi Graphics, Usability, and Visualization Laboratory, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Graphics artists commonly employ physically-based simulation for the generation of effects such as smoke, explosions, and similar phenomena.

Typical sources of such data are experiments in biology, physics or engineering, which are conducted in different configurations and use replicates to ensure statistically significant results. One common way to analyze this data is to filter it using statistical methods and then run clustering algorithms to group similar values. The clustering results can be visualized using heat maps, which show differences between groups as changes in color. However, in cases where groups of dimensions have an a priori meaning, it is not desirable to cluster all dimensions combined, since a clustering algorithm can fragment continuous blocks of records. Furthermore, identifying relevant elements in heat maps becomes more difficult as the number of dimensions increases. To aid in such situations, we have developed Matchmaker, a visualization technique that allows researchers to arbitrarily arrange and compare multiple groups of dimensions at the same time. We create separate groups of dimensions which can be clustered individually, and place them in an arrangement of heat maps reminiscent of parallel coordinates. To identify relations, we render bundled curves and ribbons between related records in different groups. We then allow interactive drill-downs using enlarged detail views of the data, which enable in-depth comparisons of clusters between groups. To reduce visual clutter, we minimize crossings between the views. This paper concludes with two case studies. The first demonstrates the value of our technique for the comparison of clustering algorithms. In the second, biologists use our system to investigate why certain strains of mice develop liver disease while others remain healthy, informally showing the efficacy of our system when analyzing multidimensional data containing distinct groups of dimensions.","article_number":"5613440","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613440","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613440/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613440/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"1027","end_page":"1035","citing_paper_count":65,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1944,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Clustering algorithms","Image color analysis","Heating","Biological cells","Joining processes"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["multidimensional data","cluster comparison","bioinformatics visualization."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.205","title":"The FlowVizMenu and Parallel Scatterplot Matrix: Hybrid Multidimensional Visualizations for Network Exploration","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":28,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"École de technologie supérieure, Montreal, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590930300","id":37590930300,"full_name":"Christophe Viau","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["École de technologie supérieure, Montreal, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"École de technologie supérieure, Montreal, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38526446600","id":38526446600,"full_name":"Michael J.

First, we present the FlowVizMenu, a radial menu containing a scatterplot that can be popped up transiently and manipulated with rapid, fluid gestures to select and modify the axes of its scatterplot. Second, the FlowVizMenu can be used to steer an attribute-driven layout of the network, causing certain nodes of a node-link diagram to move toward their corresponding positions in a scatterplot while others can be positioned manually or by force-directed layout. Third, we describe a novel hybrid approach that combines a scatterplot matrix (SPLOM) and parallel coordinates called the Parallel Scatterplot Matrix (P-SPLOM), which can be used to visualize and select features within the network. We also describe a novel arrangement of scatterplots called the Scatterplot Staircase (SPLOS) that requires less space than a traditional scatterplot matrix.

Creating perceptually effective treemaps requires carefully managing a number of design parameters including the aspect ratio and luminance of rectangles. Moreover, treemaps encode values using area, which has been found to be less accurate than judgments of other visual encodings, such as length. We conduct a series of controlled experiments aimed at producing a set of design guidelines for creating effective rectangular treemaps. We find no evidence that luminance affects area judgments, but observe that aspect ratio does have an effect. Specifically, we find that the accuracy of area comparisons suffers when the compared rectangles have extreme aspect ratios or when both are squares. Contrary to common assumptions, the optimal distribution of rectangle aspect ratios within a treemap should include non-squares, but should avoid extremes. We then compare treemaps with hierarchical bar chart displays to identify the data densities at which length-encoded bar charts become less effective than area-encoded treemaps. We report the transition points at which treemaps exhibit judgment accuracy on par with bar charts for both leaf and non-leaf tree nodes. We also find that even at relatively low data densities treemaps result in faster comparisons than bar charts. Based on these results, we present a set of guidelines for the effective use of treemaps and suggest alternate approaches for treemap layout.","article_number":"5613436","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613436","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613436/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613436/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"990","end_page":"998","citing_paper_count":63,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1081,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Encoding","Accuracy","Data visualization","Visualization","Layout","Bars","Guidelines"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Graphical Perception","Visualization","Treemaps","Rectangular Area","Visual Encoding","Experiment","Mechanical Turk"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.159","title":"GeneaQuilts: A System for Exploring Large Genealogies","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":30,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"SAP BusinessObjects Chair, École Centrale Paris, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267832500","id":37267832500,"full_name":"Anastasia Bezerianos","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SAP BusinessObjects Chair, École Centrale Paris, France"]}},{"affiliation":"INRIA, Paris, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590932700","id":37590932700,"full_name":"Pierre Dragicevic","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["INRIA, Paris, France"]}},{"affiliation":"INRIA, Paris, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407972900","id":37407972900,"full_name":"Jean-Daniel Fekete","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["INRIA, Paris, France"]}},{"affiliation":"North Carolina State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37595934400","id":37595934400,"full_name":"Juhee Bae","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["North Carolina State University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"North Carolina State University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37356872100","id":37356872100,"full_name":"Ben Watson","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["North Carolina State University, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"GeneaQuilts is a new visualization technique for representing large genealogies of up to several thousand individuals.

The novel multidimensional projection technique proposed in this work, called Part-Linear Multidimensional Projection (PLMP), has been tailored to handle multivariate data represented in Cartesian high-dimensional spaces, requiring only distance information between pairs of representative samples. This characteristic renders PLMP faster than previous methods when processing large data sets while still being competitive in terms of precision.

The registration of these two scans is desirable so that the user can clarify situations or confirm polyp findings at a location in one scan with the same location in the other, thereby improving polyp detection rates and reducing false positives. However, this supine-prone registration is challenging because of the substantial distortions in the colon shape due to the patient's change in position. We present an efficient algorithm and framework for performing this registration through the use of conformal geometry to guarantee that the registration is a diffeomorphism (a one-to-one and onto mapping). The taeniae coli and colon flexures are automatically extracted for each supine and prone surface, employing the colon geometry. The two colon surfaces are then divided into several segments using the flexures, and each segment is cut along a taenia coli and conformally flattened to the rectangular domain using holomorphic differentials. The mean curvature is color encoded as texture images, from which feature points are automatically detected using graph cut segmentation, mathematic morphological operations, and principal component analysis. Corresponding feature points are found between supine and prone and are used to adjust the conformal flattening to be quasi-conformal, such that the features become aligned. We present multiple methods of visualizing our results, including 2D flattened rendering, corresponding 3D endoluminal views, and rendering of distortion measurements. We demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of our registration method by illustrating matched views on both the 2D flattened colon images and in the 3D volume rendered colon endoluminal view. We analytically evaluate the correctness of the results by measuring the distance between features on the registered colons.","article_number":"5613475","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613475","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613475/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613475/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"1348","end_page":"1357","citing_paper_count":58,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":768,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Colon","Conformal mapping","Feature extraction","Surface morphology","Visualization","Three dimensional displays","Harmonic analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data registration","geometry-based techniques","medical visualization","mathematical foundations for visualization."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.212","title":"View-Dependent Streamlines for 3D Vector Fields","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":33,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284319100","id":37284319100,"full_name":"Stephane Marchesin","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406743400","id":37406743400,"full_name":"Cheng-Kai Chen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37599717800","id":37599717800,"full_name":"Chris Ho","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275869400","id":37275869400,"full_name":"Kwan-Liu Ma","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"This paper introduces a new streamline placement and selection algorithm for 3D vector fields.

Usually, a tradeoff between fast but imprecise classification schemes and accurate but time-consuming segmentation techniques has to be made. Furthermore, the issue of uncertainty introduced with the feature detection process is completely neglected by the majority of existing approaches.In this paper we propose a guided probabilistic volume segmentation approach that focuses on the minimization of uncertainty. In an iterative process, our system continuously assesses uncertainty of a random walker-based segmentation in order to detect regions with high ambiguity, to which the user's attention is directed to support the correction of potential misclassifications. This reduces the risk of critical segmentation errors and ensures that information about the segmentation's reliability is conveyed to the user in a dependable way. In order to improve the efficiency of the segmentation process, our technique does not only take into account the volume data to be segmented, but also enables the user to incorporate classification information. An interactive workflow has been achieved by implementing the presented system on the GPU using the OpenCL API. Our results obtained for several medical data sets of different modalities, including brain MRI and abdominal CT, demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of our approach.","article_number":"5613476","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613476","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613476/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613476/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"1358","end_page":"1365","citing_paper_count":51,"citing_patent_count":2,"download_count":1264,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Uncertainty","Image segmentation","Three dimensional displays","Probabilistic logic","Visualization","Data visualization","Transfer functions"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["volume segmentation","uncertainty","classification","random walker"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.157","title":"FI3D: Direct-Touch Interaction for the Exploration of 3D Scientific Visualization Spaces","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":37,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Groningam, Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593898200","id":37593898200,"full_name":"Lingyun Yu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Groningam, Netherlands"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Groningam, Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591151000","id":37591151000,"full_name":"Pjotr Svetachov","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Groningam, Netherlands"]}},{"affiliation":"INRIA, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591317800","id":37591317800,"full_name":"Petra Isenberg","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["INRIA, France"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Groningam, Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591149600","id":37591149600,"full_name":"Maarten H.

The exploration of three-dimensional data is core to many tasks and domains involving scientific visualizations. Thus, effective data navigation techniques are essential to enable comprehension, understanding, and analysis of the information space. While evidence exists that touch can provide higher-bandwidth input, somesthetic information that is valuable when interacting with virtual worlds, and awareness when working in collaboration, scientific data exploration in 3D poses unique challenges to the development of effective data manipulations. We present a technique that provides touch interaction with 3D scientific data spaces in 7 DOF. This interaction does not require the presence of dedicated objects to constrain the mapping, a design decision important for many scientific datasets such as particle simulations in astronomy or physics. We report on an evaluation that compares the technique to conventional mouse-based interaction. Our results show that touch interaction is competitive in interaction speed for translation and integrated interaction, is easy to learn and use, and is preferred for exploration and wayfinding tasks. To further explore the applicability of our basic technique for other types of scientific visualizations we present a second case study, adjusting the interaction to the illustrative visualization of fiber tracts of the brain and the manipulation of cutting planes in this context.","article_number":"5613504","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613504","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613504/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613504/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"1613","end_page":"1622","citing_paper_count":50,"citing_patent_count":5,"download_count":1368,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three dimensional displays","Data visualization","Mice","Aerospace electronics","Space exploration","Navigation","Solid modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Direct-touch interaction","wall displays","3D navigation and exploration","evaluation","illustrative visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.197","title":"Stacking Graphic Elements to Avoid Over-Plotting","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":38,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Chicago, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606167900","id":37606167900,"full_name":"Tuan Nhon Dang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Chicago, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Statistics, Northwestern University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37560536200","id":37560536200,"full_name":"Leland Wilkinson","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Statistics, Northwestern University, USA","Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Chicago, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, US","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37548165700","id":37548165700,"full_name":"Anushka Anand","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, US"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"An ongoing challenge for information visualization is how to deal with over-plotting forced by ties or the relatively limitedvisual field of display devices.

All of these methods have at least one of three deficiencies:1) magnitude judgments are biased because area and color have convex downward perceptual functions, 2) area, hue, and brightnesshave relatively restricted ranges of perceptual intensity compared to length representations, and/or 3) it is difficult to brush or link toindividual cases when viewing aggregations. In this paper, we introduce a new technique for visualizing and interacting with datasetsthat preserves density information by stacking overlapping cases.

There are several well-established thematic map types for quantitative data on the ratio-scale associated with regions: choropleth maps, cartograms, and proportional symbol maps. However, all these maps suffer from limitations, especially if large data values are associated with small regions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel type of quantitative thematic map, the necklace map. In a necklace map, the regions of the underlying two-dimensional map are projected onto intervals on a one-dimensional curve (the necklace) that surrounds the map regions. Symbols are scaled such that their area corresponds to the data of their region and placed without overlap inside the corresponding interval on the necklace. Necklace maps appear clear and uncluttered and allow for comparatively large symbol sizes. They visualize data sets well which are not proportional to region sizes. The linear ordering of the symbols along the necklace facilitates an easy comparison of symbol sizes. One map can contain several nested or disjoint necklaces to visualize clustered data. The advantages of necklace maps come at a price: the association between a symbol and its region is weaker than with other types of maps. Interactivity can help to strengthen this association if necessary. We present an automated approach to generate necklace maps which allows the user to interactively control the final symbol placement. We validate our approach with experiments using various data sets and maps.","article_number":"5613424","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613424","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613424/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613424/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"881","end_page":"889","citing_paper_count":37,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":814,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Silicon","Shape","Data visualization","Internet","Niobium","Africa","Labeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Geographic Visualization","Automated Cartography","Proportional Symbol Maps","Necklace Maps"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.166","title":"Illustrative Stream Surfaces","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":46,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Universität Leipzig, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590924500","id":37590924500,"full_name":"Silvia Born","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universität Leipzig, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37565763400","id":37565763400,"full_name":"Alexander Wiebel","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Universität Leipzig, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37587961900","id":37587961900,"full_name":"Jan Friedrich","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universität Leipzig, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Universität Leipzig, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282574800","id":37282574800,"full_name":"Gerik Scheuermann","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universität Leipzig, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Universität Leipzig, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37448237300","id":37448237300,"full_name":"Dirk Bartz","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Universität Leipzig, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Stream surfaces are an intuitive approach to represent 3D vector fields. In many cases, however, they are challenging objects to visualize and to understand, due to a high degree of self-occlusion. Despite the need for adequate rendering methods, little work has been done so far in this important research area. In this paper, we present an illustrative rendering strategy for stream surfaces. In our approach, we apply various rendering techniques, which are inspired by the traditional flow illustrations drawn by Dallmann and Abraham \\& Shaw in the early 1980s. Among these techniques are contour lines and halftoning to show the overall surface shape. Flow direction as well as singularities on the stream surface are depicted by illustrative surface streamlines. ;To go beyond reproducing static text book images, we provide several interaction features, such as movable cuts and slabs allowing an interactive exploration of the flow and insights into subjacent structures, e.g., the inner windings of vortex breakdown bubbles. These methods take only the parameterized stream surface as input, require no further preprocessing, and can be freely combined by the user. We explain the design, GPU-implementation, and combination of the different illustrative rendering and interaction methods and demonstrate the potential of our approach by applying it to stream surfaces from various flow simulations. ;","article_number":"5613473","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613473","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613473/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613473/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"1329","end_page":"1338","citing_paper_count":34,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":898,"insert_date":"20101118","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Shape","Visualization","Streaming media","Pixel","Data visualization","Surface texture"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["flow visualization","stream surfaces","illustrative rendering","silhouettes","GPU technique","3D vector fields"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.191","title":"Rethinking Map Legends with Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":47,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Information Science, City University of London, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37605079900","id":37605079900,"full_name":"Jason Dykes","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Information Science, City University of London, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Information Science, City University of London, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399045100","id":37399045100,"full_name":"Jo Wood","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Information Science, City University of London, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Information Science, City University of London, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590960700","id":37590960700,"full_name":"Aidan Slingsby","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Information Science, City University of London, UK"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"This design paper presents new guidance for creating map legends in a dynamic environment.

Broad visualization legend themes include: The Ground Truth Legend, The Legend as Statistical Graphicand The Map is the Legend. Together, these concepts enable us to augment legends with dynamic properties that address specificneeds, rethink their nature and role and contribute to a wider re-evaluation of maps as artifacts of usage rather than statements offact.

In this paper, we propose a data structure and associated construction algorithm for fast cell location in unstructured grids, and apply it to the interpolation problem. Based on the concept of bounding interval hierarchies, the proposed approach is memory-efficient, fast and numerically robust. We examine the performance characteristics of the proposed approach and compare it to existing approaches using a number of benchmark problems related to vector field visualization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach can successfully accommodate large datasets, and discuss application to visualization on both CPUs and GPUs.","article_number":"5613496","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613496","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613496/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613496/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"1541","end_page":"1550","citing_paper_count":31,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":759,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Interpolation","Data visualization","Indexes","Arrays","Octrees"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["unstructured grids","cell location","interpolation","vector field visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.170","title":"Interactive Vector Field Feature Identification","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":49,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Computing and Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37602531100","id":37602531100,"full_name":"Joel Daniels II","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computing and Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computing and Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592852700","id":37592852700,"full_name":"Erik W.

However, there is a conceptual and visual gap between the simulation model behavior and the data set that makes data analysis more difficult. We propose a simulation model view that helps to bridge that gap by visually combining the simulation model description and the generated data. The simulation model view provides a visual outline of the simulation process and the corresponding simulation model. The view is integrated in a Coordinated Multiple Views ;(CMV) system. As the simulation model view provides a limited display space, we use three levels of details. We explored the use of the simulation model view, in close collaboration with a domain expert, to understand and tune an electronic unit injector (EUI). We also developed analysis procedures based on the view. The EUI is mostly used in heavy duty Diesel engines. We were mainly interested in understanding the model and how to tune it for three different operation modes: low emission, low consumption, and high power. Very positive feedback from the domain expert shows that the use of the simulation model view and the corresponding ;analysis procedures within a CMV system represents an effective technique for interactive visual analysis of multiple simulation runs.","article_number":"5613486","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613486","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613486/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613486/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"1449","end_page":"1457","citing_paper_count":26,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":764,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Computational modeling","Data models","Analytical models","Fuels","Visualization","Engines","Needles"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["visualization in physical sciences and engineering","time series data","coordinated multiple views"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.168","title":"Interactive Histology of Large-Scale Biomedical Image Stacks","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":54,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Harvard University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268212100","id":37268212100,"full_name":"Won-Ki Jeong","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University for Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37560044500","id":37560044500,"full_name":"Jens Schneider","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["King Abdullah University for Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Harvard University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087286975","id":37087286975,"full_name":"Stephen Turney","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Harvard University, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard Medical School, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087286616","id":37087286616,"full_name":"Beverly E Faulkner-Jones","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard Medical School, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Technische Universität München, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089270604","id":37089270604,"full_name":"Dominik Meyer","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technische Universität München, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Technische Universität München, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37444424000","id":37444424000,"full_name":"Rudiger Westermann","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Technische Universität München, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Neurobiology, Harvard Medical School, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37391007300","id":37391007300,"full_name":"R.

Unlike earlier works, our paradigm allows easy scalability across different applications, interaction modalities, displays and users. The novelty of the design lies in its distributed nature allowing well-compartmented, application independent, and application specific modules. This enables adapting to different 2D applications and interaction modalities easily by changing a few application specific modules. We demonstrate four challenging 2D applications on a nine projector display to demonstrate the application scalability of our method: map visualization, virtual graffiti, virtual bulletin board and an emergency management system. We demonstrate the scalability of our method to multiple interaction modalities by showing both gesture-based and laser-based user interfaces. Finally, we improve earlier distributed methods to register multiple projectors. Previous works need multiple patterns to identify the neighbors, the configuration of the display and the registration across multiple projectors in logarithmic time with respect to the number of projectors in the display. We propose a new approach that achieves this using a single pattern based on specially augmented QR codes in constant time. Further, previous distributed registration algorithms are prone to large misregistrations. We propose a novel radially cascading geometric registration technique that yields significantly better accuracy. Thus, our improvements allow a significantly more efficient and accurate technique for distributed self-registration of multi-projector display walls.","article_number":"5613505","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613505","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613505/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613505/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"1623","end_page":"1632","citing_paper_count":25,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":705,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Cameras","Servers","History","Arrays","Algorithm design and analysis","Tracking"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Tiled Displays","Human-Computer Interaction","Gesture-Based Interaction","Multi-user interaction","Distributed algorithms"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.146","title":"Discontinuities in Continuous Scatter Plots","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":57,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Simulation and Graphics, University of Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37601992200","id":37601992200,"full_name":"Dirk J.

The idea is to define a scalar density value based on the map between an n-dimensional spatial domain and an m-dimensional data domain, which describe the CSP space. Usually the data domain is two-dimensional to visually convey the underlying, density coded, data. In this paper we investigate kinds of map-based discontinuities, especially for the practical cases n = m = 2 and n = 3 | m = 2, and we depict relations between them and attributes of the resulting CSP itself. Additionally, we show that discontinuities build critical line structures, and we introduce algorithms to detect them. Further, we introduce a discontinuity-based visualization approach—called contribution map (CM)—which establishes a relationship between the CSP's data domain and the number of connected components in the spatial domain. We show that CMs enhance the CSP-based linking & brushing interaction.

However, to date, very little work has been done to help users achieve this kind of understanding. Visual representation is especially appealing for this task because it offers the potential to allow users to efficiently observe the objects of interest in a direct and holistic way. Thus, in this paper, we attempt to formalize the problem of visualizing the diversity of a large (more than 1000 objects), multivariate (more than 5 attributes) data set as one worth deeper investigation by the information visualization community. In doing so, we contribute a precise definition of diversity, a set of requirements for diversity visualizations based on this definition, and a formal user study design intended to evaluate the capacity of a visual representation for communicating diversity information. Our primary contribution, however, is a visual representation, called the Diversity Map, for visualizing diversity. An evaluation of the Diversity Map using our study design shows that users can judge elements of diversity consistently and as or more accurately than when using the only other representation specifically designed to visualize diversity.","article_number":"5613443","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613443","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613443/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613443/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"1053","end_page":"1062","citing_paper_count":24,"citing_patent_count":8,"download_count":1028,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Encoding","Histograms","Image color analysis","Three dimensional displays","Particle measurements"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["information visualization","diversity","categorical data","multivariate data","evaluation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.152","title":"Exploration and Visualization of Segmentation Uncertainty using Shape and Appearance Prior Information","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":61,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, CA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38349512700","id":38349512700,"full_name":"Ahmed Saad","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, CA"]}},{"affiliation":"Medical Image Analysis Laboratory MIAL, School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294023500","id":37294023500,"full_name":"Ghassan Hamarneh","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Medical Image Analysis Laboratory MIAL, School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"Graphics, Usability, and Visualization GrUVi Laboratory, School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275858700","id":37275858700,"full_name":"Torsten Möller","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Graphics, Usability, and Visualization GrUVi Laboratory, School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We develop an interactive analysis and visualization tool for probabilistic segmentation in medical imaging.

This classic camera model has important advantages such as simplicity, which enables efficient software and hardware implementations, and similarity to the human eye, which yields images familiar to the user. However, the planar pinhole camera has only a single viewpoint, which limits images to parts of the scene to which there is direct line of sight. In this paper we introduce the curved ray camera to address the single viewpoint limitation. Rays are C1-continuous curves that bend to circumvent occluders. Our camera is designed to provide a fast 3-D point projection operation, which enables interactive visualization. The camera supports both 3-D surface and volume datasets. The camera is a powerful tool that enables seamless integration of multiple perspectives for overcoming occlusions in visualization while minimizing distortions.","article_number":"5613463","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613463","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613463/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613463/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"1235","end_page":"1242","citing_paper_count":22,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":581,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Cameras","Rendering (computer graphics)","Data visualization","Visualization","Mathematical model","Computational modeling","Context"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Alleviating occlusions","camera model","curved rays","multiperspective visualization","interactive visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.163","title":"Gremlin: An Interactive Visualization Model for Analyzing Genomic Rearrangements","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":63,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087747396","id":37087747396,"full_name":"Trevor O'Brien","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591075900","id":37591075900,"full_name":"Anna Ritz","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271723100","id":37271723100,"full_name":"Benjamin Raphael","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science Department, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275712600","id":37275712600,"full_name":"David Laidlaw","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science Department, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this work we present, apply, and evaluate a novel, interactive visualization model for comparative analysis of structural variants and rearrangements in human and cancer genomes, with emphasis on data integration and uncertainty visualization.

To facilitate the creation of novel visualizations we present a new software framework, behaviorism, which provides a wide range of flexibility when working with dynamic information on visual, temporal, and ontological levels, but at the same time providing appropriate abstractions which allow developers to create prototypes quickly which can then easily be turned into robust systems. The core of the framework is a set of three interconnected graphs, each with associated operators: a scene graph for high-performance 3D rendering, a data graph for different layers of semantically-linked heterogeneous data, and a timing graph for sophisticated control of scheduling, interaction, and animation. In particular, the timing graph provides a unified system to add behaviors to both data and visual elements, as well as to the behaviors themselves. To evaluate the framework we look briefly at three different projects all of which required novel visualizations in different domains, and all of which worked with dynamic data in different ways: an interactive ecological simulation, an information art installation, and an information visualization technique.","article_number":"5613455","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613455","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613455/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613455/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"1164","end_page":"1171","citing_paper_count":21,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":925,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Rendering (computer graphics)","Timing","Data models","Animation","Programming"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization System and Toolkit Design (primary keyword)","Time-varying Data","Streaming Data","Animation","Visual Design"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.130","title":"An Extension of Wilkinson’s Algorithm for Positioning Tick Labels on Axes","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":66,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Stanford, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604514900","id":37604514900,"full_name":"Justin Talbot","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stanford, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stanford, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37594968800","id":37594968800,"full_name":"Sharon Lin","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stanford, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stanford, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349803800","id":37349803800,"full_name":"Pat Hanrahan","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stanford, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The non-data components of a visualization, such as axes and legends, can often be just as important as the data itself.

As this increasing amount of available information is used to link individuals to their ancestors, the resulting trees become deeper and more dense, which justifies the need for using organized, space-efficient layouts to display the data. Existing layouts are often only able to show a small subset of the data at a time. As a result, it is easy to become lost when navigating through the data or to lose sight of the overall tree structure. On the contrary, leaving space for unknown ancestors allows one to better understand the tree's structure, but leaving this space becomes expensive and allows fewer generations to be displayed at a time. In this work, we propose that the H-tree based layout be used in genealogical software to display ancestral trees. We will show that this layout presents an increase in the number of displayable generations, provides a nicely arranged, symmetrical, intuitive and organized fractal structure, increases the user's ability to understand and navigate through the data, and accounts for the visualization requirements necessary for displaying such trees. Finally, user-study results indicate potential for user acceptance of the new layout.","article_number":"5613444","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613444","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613444/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613444/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"1063","end_page":"1072","citing_paper_count":20,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":649,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Layout","Data visualization","Binary trees","Navigation","Software","Shape","Context"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Genealogy","Pedigree","H-Tree"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.150","title":"Evaluating the impact of task demands and block resolution on the effectiveness of pixel-based visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":68,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Science, Swansea University, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591074800","id":37591074800,"full_name":"Rita Borgo","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science, Swansea University, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Psychology, Swansea University, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591072200","id":37591072200,"full_name":"Karl Proctor","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Psychology, Swansea University, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Science, Swansea University, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37280982800","id":37280982800,"full_name":"Min Chen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Science, Swansea University, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing, Heidelberg University, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37393638200","id":37393638200,"full_name":"Heike Jänicke","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing, Heidelberg University, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Geography, Swansea University, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274098800","id":37274098800,"full_name":"Tavi Murray","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Geography, Swansea University, UK"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Psychology, Swansea University, UK","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591073500","id":37591073500,"full_name":"Ian Thornton","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Psychology, Swansea University, UK"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Pixel-based visualization is a popular method of conveying large amounts of numerical data graphically.

In the first study, we included 5 separate tasks to exert different perceptual loads. We found that performance varied considerably as a function of task, ranging from 75% correct in low-load tasks to below 40% in high-load tasks. There was a small but consistent effect of resolution, with the uniform patch improving performance by around 6% relative to higher block resolution. In the second user study, we focused on a high-load task for evaluating month-to-month changes across different regions of the temperature range. We tested both CIE L*u*v* and RGB color spaces. We found that the nature of the change-evaluation errors related directly to the distance between the compared regions in the mapped color space. We were able to reduce such errors by using multiple color bands for the same data range.

We generalize the concept of scale-invariant opacity—typical for isosurface rendering—to semi-transparent interval volumes. Scale-invariant rendering is independent of physical space dimensions and therefore directly facilitates the analysis of data characteristics. Our model represents sharp isosurfaces as limits of interval volumes and combines them with features of direct volume rendering. Our objective is accurate rendering, guaranteeing that all isosurfaces and interval volumes are visualized in a crack-free way with correct spatial ordering. We achieve simultaneous direct and interval volume rendering by extending preintegration and explicit peak finding with data-driven splitting of ray integration and hybrid computation in physical and data domains. Our algorithm is suitable for efficient parallel processing for interactive applications as demonstrated by our CUDA implementation.","article_number":"5613492","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613492","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613492/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613492/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"1505","end_page":"1514","citing_paper_count":17,"citing_patent_count":1,"download_count":623,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Isosurfaces","Rendering (computer graphics)","Mathematical model","Polynomials","Transfer functions"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["direct volume rendering","interval volume","isosurface","ray casting","preintegration","scale-invariant opacity"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.192","title":"Scalable Multi-variate Analytics of Seismic and Satellite-based Observational Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":70,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403856700","id":37403856700,"full_name":"Xiaoru Yuan","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Peking University, Beijing, Beijing, CN","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37397293900","id":37397293900,"full_name":"He Xiao","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Peking University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"]}},{"affiliation":"Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085681553","id":37085681553,"full_name":"Hanqi Guo","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37411096400","id":37411096400,"full_name":"Peihong Guo","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, University of Tennessee, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37585370900","id":37585370900,"full_name":"Wesley Kendall","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, University of Tennessee, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37281262900","id":37281262900,"full_name":"Jian Huang","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), and School of EECS, Peking University, China"]}},{"affiliation":"China Earthquake Networks Center, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37599086100","id":37599086100,"full_name":"Yongxian Zhang","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["China Earthquake Networks Center, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Over the past few years, large human populations around the world have been affected by an increase in significant seismic activities.

Seismic and satellite data are integrated temporally and spatially. Users can select temporal ;and spatial ranges to zoom in on specific seismic events, as well as to inspect changes both during and after the events. Tools for designing high dimensional transfer functions have been developed to enable efficient and intuitive comprehension of the multi-modal data. Spread-sheet style comparisons are used for data drill-down as well as presentation. Comparisons between distinct seismic events are also provided for characterizing event-wise differences.

For instance, in the medical diagnostic procedure, the patient's symptoms often lead to specification of features, tissues and organs of particular interest. One such example is pockets of gas which, if found inside the body at abnormal locations, are a crucial part of a diagnostic visualization. This paper presents an approach that enhances DVR transfer function design with spatial localization based on user specified material dependencies. Semantic expressions are used to define conditions based on relations between different materials, such as only render iodine uptake when close to liver. The underlying methods rely on estimations of material distributions which are acquired by weighing local neighborhoods of the data against approximations of material likelihood functions. This information is encoded and used to influence rendering according to the user's specifications. The result is improved focus on important features by allowing the user to suppress spatially less-important data. In line with requirements from actual clinical DVR practice, the methods do not require explicit material segmentation that would be impossible or prohibitively time-consuming to achieve in most real cases. The scheme scales well to higher dimensions which accounts for multi-dimensional transfer functions and multivariate data. Dual-Energy Computed Tomography, an important new modality in radiology, is used to demonstrate this scalability. In several examples we show significantly improved focus on clinically important aspects in the rendered images.","article_number":"5613470","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613470","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613470/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613470/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"1301","end_page":"1310","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":709,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Materials","Histograms","Rendering (computer graphics)","Blood","Semantics","Transfer functions","Probes"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Direct Volume Rendering","Transfer Function","Spatial Conditioning","Neighborhood Meta-Data."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.151","title":"Exploded View Diagrams of Mathematical Surfaces","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":72,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of California Berkeley, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37603800800","id":37603800800,"full_name":"Olga Karpenko","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California Berkeley, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Adobe Systems, Inc., USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37597594400","id":37597594400,"full_name":"Wilmot Li","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Adobe Systems, Inc., USA"]}},{"affiliation":"IIT Delhi, India","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591261000","id":37591261000,"full_name":"Niloy Mitra","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IIT Delhi, India"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California Berkeley, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282718200","id":37282718200,"full_name":"Maneesh Agrawala","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California Berkeley, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present a technique for visualizing complicated mathematical surfaces that is inspired by hand-designed topological illustrations.

Furthermore, to enable a feature driven analysis of the flow, one is mainly interested in streak surfaces that show separation profiles and thus detect unstable manifolds in the flow. The computation of such separation surfaces requires to place seeding structures at the separation locations and to let the structures move correspondingly to these locations in the unsteady flow. Since only little knowledge exists about the time evolution of separating streak surfaces, at this time, an automated exploration of 3D unsteady flows using such surfaces is not feasible. Therefore, in this paper we present an interactive approach for the visual analysis of separating streak surfaces. Our method draws upon recent work on the extraction of Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) and the real-time visualization of streak surfaces on the GPU. We propose an interactive technique for computing ridges in the finite time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) field at each time step, and we use these ridges as seeding structures to track streak surfaces in the time-varying flow. By showing separation surfaces in combination with particle trajectories, and by letting the user interactively change seeding parameters such as particle density and position, visually guided exploration of separation profiles in 3D is provided. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the reconstruction and display of semantic separable surfaces in 3D unsteady flows can be performed interactively, giving rise to new possibilities for gaining insight into complex flow phenomena.","article_number":"5613499","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613499","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613499/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613499/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"1569","end_page":"1577","citing_paper_count":14,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":466,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three dimensional displays","Pixel","Graphics processing unit","Skeleton","Feature extraction","Surface reconstruction"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Unsteady flow visualization","feature extraction","streak surface generation","GPUs"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.222","title":"Visualizations everywhere: A Multiplatform Infrastructure for Linked Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":74,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Limited, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37542391000","id":37542391000,"full_name":"Danyel Fisher","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Limited, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37585786500","id":37585786500,"full_name":"Steven Drucker","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Limited, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37603822300","id":37603822300,"full_name":"Roland Fernandez","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Corporation, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591246900","id":37591246900,"full_name":"Scott Ruble","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Corporation, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In order to use new visualizations, most toolkits require application developers to rebuild their applications and distribute new versions to users.

In this paper, we introduce a hybrid rendering technique based on polygon distortion and local ray tracing that facilitates interactive high-quality visualization of multiple objects moving at relativistic speeds in arbitrary directions.

While it enables high-quality volume rendering, it cannot support interactive rendering due to its high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a fast high-quality volume ray-casting algorithm which effectively increases the sampling rate. While a ray traverses the volume, intensity values are uniformly reconstructed using a high-order convolution filter. Additional samplings, referred to as virtual samplings, are carried out within a ray segment from a cubic spline curve interpolating those uniformly reconstructed intensities. These virtual samplings are performed by evaluating the polynomial function of the cubic spline curve via simple arithmetic operations. The min max blocks are refined accordingly for accurate empty space skipping in the proposed method.

This type of visualization display is achieved by projecting precisely controlled illumination from multiple projectors onto the real-world colored objects. For such a task, the placement of the projectors is critical in assuring that the desired visualization is possible. Using ad hoc projector placement may cause some appearances to suffer from color shifting due to insufficient projector light radiance being exposed onto the physical surface. This leads to an incorrect appearance and ultimately to a false and potentially misleading visualization. In this paper, we present a framework to discover the optimal position and orientation of the projectors for such projection-based visualization displays. An optimal projector placement should be able to achieve the desired visualization with minimal projector light radiance. When determining optimal projector placement, object visibility, surface reflectance properties, and projector-surface distance and orientation need to be considered. We first formalize a theory for appearance editing image formation and construct a constrained linear system of equations that express when a desired novel appearance or visualization is possible given a geometric and surface reflectance model of the physical surface. Then, we show how to apply this constrained system in an adaptive search to efficiently discover the optimal projector placement which achieves the desired appearance. Constraints can be imposed on the maximum radiance allowed by the projectors and the projectors' placement to support specific goals of various visualization applications. We perform several real-world and simulated appearance edits and visualizations to demonstrate the improvement obtained by our discovered projector placement over ad hoc projector placement.","article_number":"5613506","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613506","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613506/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613506/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"1633","end_page":"1641","citing_paper_count":12,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":652,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Pixel","Equations","Image color analysis","Mathematical model","Linear systems","Planning"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["large and High-resolution Displays","Interaction Design","Mobile and Ubiquitous Visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.174","title":"Laws of Attraction: From Perceptual Forces to Conceptual Similarity","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":79,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"UNC-Charlotte, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37548028800","id":37548028800,"full_name":"Caroline Ziemkiewicz","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UNC-Charlotte, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"UNC-Charlotte, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282563400","id":37282563400,"full_name":"Robert Kosara","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["UNC-Charlotte, USA"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Many of the pressing questions in information visualization deal with how exactly a user reads a collection of visual marks as information about relationships between entities. Previous research has suggested that people see parts of a visualization as objects, and may metaphorically interpret apparent physical relationships between these objects as suggestive of data relationships. We explored this hypothesis in detail in a series of user experiments. Inspired by the concept of implied dynamics in psychology, we first studied whether perceived gravity acting on a mark in a scatterplot can lead to errors in a participant's recall of the mark's position. The results of this study suggested that such position errors exist, but may be more strongly influenced by attraction between marks. We hypothesized that such apparent attraction may be influenced by elements used to suggest relationship between objects, such as connecting lines, grouping elements, and visual similarity. We further studied what visual elements are most likely to cause this attraction effect, and whether the elements that best predicted attraction errors were also those which suggested conceptual relationships most strongly. Our findings show a correlation between attraction errors and intuitions about relatedness, pointing towards a possible mechanism by which the perception of visual marks becomes an interpretation of data relationships.","article_number":"5613438","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613438","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613438/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613438/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"1009","end_page":"1016","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1034,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","Gravity","Image color analysis","Layout","Joining processes","Data visualization","Dynamics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Perceptual cognition","visualization models","laboratory studies","cognition theory"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.217","title":"Visualization of Graph Products","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":80,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Image and Signal Processing Group, Institute for Computer Science, Universität Leipzig, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38243241100","id":38243241100,"full_name":"Stefan Jänicke","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Image and Signal Processing Group, Institute for Computer Science, Universität Leipzig, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Image and Signal Processing Group, Institute for Computer Science, Universität Leipzig, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37410427900","id":37410427900,"full_name":"Christian Heine","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Image and Signal Processing Group, Institute for Computer Science, Universität Leipzig, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Bioinformatics Group, Department of Computer Science and Interdisciplinary Center for Bioinformatics, Universität Leipzig, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590949800","id":37590949800,"full_name":"Marc Hellmuth","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Bioinformatics Group, Department of Computer Science and Interdisciplinary Center for Bioinformatics, Universität Leipzig, Germany","Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271818100","id":37271818100,"full_name":"Peter F.

To gain insight into such relationships, their corresponding graph can be visualized. In the past, many classes of graphs have been defined, e.g. trees, planar graphs, directed acyclic graphs, and visualization algorithms were proposed for these classes. Although many graphs may only be classified as \"general\" graphs, they can contain substructures that belong to a certain class. Archambault proposed the TopoLayout framework: rather than draw any arbitrary graph using one method, split the graph into components that are homogeneous with respect to one graph class and then draw each component with an algorithm best suited for this class. Graph products constitute a class that arises frequently in graph theory, but for which no visualization algorithm has been proposed until now. In this paper, we present an algorithm for drawing graph products and the aesthetic criterion graph product's drawings are subject to. We show that the popular High-Dimensional Embedder approach applied to cartesian products already respects this aestetic criterion, but has disadvantages. We also present how our method is integrated as a new component into the TopoLayout framework. Our implementation is used for further research of graph products in a biological context.","article_number":"5613446","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613446","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613446/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613446/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"1082","end_page":"1089","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":696,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Layout","Visualization","Image edge detection","Springs","Complexity theory","Signal processing algorithms","Shape"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Graph drawing","graph products","TopoLayout."]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.160","title":"Gradient Estimation Revitalized","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":81,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Graphics, Usability, and Visualization GrUVi Laboratory, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085906267","id":37085906267,"full_name":"Usman Alim","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Graphics, Usability, and Visualization GrUVi Laboratory, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"Graphics, Usability, and Visualization GrUVi Laboratory, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275858700","id":37275858700,"full_name":"Torsten Möller","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Graphics, Usability, and Visualization GrUVi Laboratory, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"]}},{"affiliation":"CNRS-UCBN-ENSICAEN, GREYC, Caen, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294569700","id":37294569700,"full_name":"Laurent Condat","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["CNRS-UCBN-ENSICAEN, GREYC, Caen, France"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We investigate the use of a Fourier-domain derivative error kernel to quantify the error incurred while estimating the gradient of a function from scalar point samples on a regular lattice. We use the error kernel to show that gradient reconstruction quality is significantly enhanced merely by shifting the reconstruction kernel to the centers of the principal lattice directions. Additionally, we exploit the algebraic similarities between the scalar and derivative error kernels to design asymptotically optimal gradient estimation filters that can be factored into an infinite impulse response interpolation prefilter and a finite impulse response directional derivative filter. This leads to a significant performance gain both in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. The interpolation prefilter provides an accurate scalar approximation and can be re-used to cheaply compute directional derivatives on-the-fly without the need to store gradients. We demonstrate the impact of our filters in the context of volume rendering of scalar data sampled on the Cartesian and Body-Centered Cubic lattices.

A delicate and often-studied component is the interpolation of off-grid samples, where aliasing can lead to misleading artifacts and blurring, potentially hiding fine details of critical importance. The verifiable visualization framework we describe aims to account for these errors directly in the volume generation stage, and we specifically target volumetric data obtained via computed tomography (CT) reconstruction. In this case the raw data are the X-ray projections obtained from the scanner and the volume data generation process is the CT algorithm. Our framework informs the CT reconstruction process of the specific filter intended for interpolation in the subsequent visualization process, and this in turn ensures an accurate interpolation there at a set tolerance. Here, we focus on fast trilinear interpolation in conjunction with an octree-type mixed resolution volume representation without T-junctions. Efficient rendering is achieved by a space-efficient and locality-optimized representation, which can straightforwardly exploit fast fixed-function pipelines on GPUs.","article_number":"5613493","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613493","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613493/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613493/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"1515","end_page":"1524","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":320,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Interpolation","Computed tomography","Rendering (computer graphics)","Data visualization","Frequency domain analysis","Pipelines","Image reconstruction"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Direct volume rendering","computed tomography","filtered back-projection","verifiable visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.188","title":"Preface","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":84,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"INRIA","full_name":"Jean-Daniel Fekete","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["INRIA"]}},{"affiliation":"IBM","full_name":"Frank van Ham","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IBM"]}},{"affiliation":"The Ohio State University","full_name":"Raghu Machiraju","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["The Ohio State University"]}},{"affiliation":"Simon Fraser University","full_name":"Torsten Moller","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Simon Fraser University"]}},{"affiliation":"Harvard University","full_name":"Hanspeter Pfister","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Harvard University"]}}]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"These are the proceedings of the IEEE Visualization Conference 2010 (Vis 2010) and the IEEE Information Visualization Conference 2010 (InfoVis 2010) held during October 24 to 29, 2010 in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.","article_number":"5613419","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613419","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613419/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613419/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"xi","end_page":"xx","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":168,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Special issues and sections","Meetings","Visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.220","title":"VisWeek Keynote Address","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":85,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of California, Santa Barbara","full_name":"Mary Hegarty","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Santa Barbara"]}}]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Journals","article_number":"5613423","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613423","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613423/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613423/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"xxiv","end_page":"xxiv","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":156,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.165","title":"IEEE Computer Society Jobs Board","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":86,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[]},"access_type":"EPHEMERA","content_type":"Journals","article_number":"5613510","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613510","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613510/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613510/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":5613414,"publication_year":2010,"publication_date":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","start_page":"xxxi","end_page":"xxxi","citing_paper_count":0,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":61,"insert_date":"20101028","index_terms":{}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.219","title":"VisWeek Capstone Address","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"6","issn":"2160-9306","rank":87,"volume":"16","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Johns Hopkins University, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294404700","id":37294404700,"full_name":"Alexander S.
