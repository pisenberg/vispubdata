"Large multivariate time-oriented networks have been gaining an increasing relevance in different domains. In order to support Visual Analytics processes on this kind of data, appropriate storage and retrieval methods are needed that take into account the scale, dimensionality, and in particular the complex nature of time. We introduce TimeGraph, a data management framework consisting of a data model and two levels of abstraction. TimeGraph captures both the topology of networks and the inherent structure of time into a property graph data structure, and transparently handles them by graph-based operations. TimeGraph aims to be an expressive, easy-to-use and extensible framework, enabling data reduction by selection and aggregation over both the temporal and the topological properties of data, to foster interactive visualization and analysis.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042498/","LOCKED","7042498","Vienna University of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085361518","1","Albert Amor-Amorós","37085361518","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Vienna University of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37569322900","2","Paolo Federico","37569322900","Vienna University of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282584500","3","Silvia Miksch","37282584500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042498","218","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042498/","","","","","","","","","Data models","Data visualization","Visual analytics","Databases","Complexity theory","Calendars","Educational institutions","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042498","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","2","217","TimeGraph: A data management framework for visual analytics of large multivariate time-oriented networks"
"The VAST 2014 Mini-challenge 2 provided a set of GPS vehicle tracking and credit card transaction data with the aim of inferring behavior of those using the vehicles and credit cards. In particular it required designing or applying a visual analytics system to identify typical behaviours with which atypical, suspicious activity could be contrasted. It is an example of the more general case of inferring behavior from movement records (e.g., from mobile devices or public bikeshare schemes). In this brief paper we summarise the design taken to address the particular VAST challenge while proposing a general approach to movement-based behaviour detection.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042569/","LOCKED","7042569","giCentre, City University London","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399045100","1","Jo Wood","37399045100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042569","368","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042569/","Movement visualization","visual analytics","GPS","coordinated views","geospatial","","","","Vehicles","Geospatial analysis","Visual analytics","Global Positioning System","Credit cards","Surveillance","","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042569","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","3","367","Visual analytics of GPS tracks: From location to place to behaviour"

"We present TimeFork, an analytics technique for predicting the behavior of multivariate time-series data originating from modern disciplines such as economics (stock market) and meteorology (climate), with human-in-the-loop. We identify two types of machine-generated predictions for such datasets: temporal prediction that predicts the future of an attribute; and spatial prediction that predicts an attribute based on the other attributes in the dataset. Visual exploration of this prediction space, constituting of these predictions of different confidences, by chunking and chaining predictions over time promises accurate user-guided predictions. In order to utilize TimeFork technique, we created a visual analytics application for user-guided prediction over different time periods, thus allowing for visual exploration of time-series data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042501/","LOCKED","7042501","University of Maryland","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085388100","1","Sriram Karthik Badam","37085388100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Purdue University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085454267","2","Jieqiong Zhao","37085454267","University of Maryland","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295438200","3","Niklas Elmqvist","37295438200","Purdue University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282598900","4","David S.

"The creation of similarity functions based on visual-interactive user feedback is a promising means to capture the mental similarity notion in the heads of domain experts. In particular, concepts exist where users arrange multivariate data objects on a 2D data landscape in order to learn new similarity functions. While systems that incorporate numerical data attributes have been presented in the past, the remaining overall goal may be to develop systems also for mixed data sets. In this work, we present a feedback model for categorical data which can be used alongside of numerical feedback models in future.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042503/","LOCKED","7042503","Fraunhofer IGD, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606179600","1","Jürgen Bernard","37606179600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Fraunhofer IGD, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085393400","2","Marco Hutter","37085393400","Fraunhofer IGD, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085396972","3","David Sessler","37085396972","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282557600","4","Tobias Schreck","37282557600","University of Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38551542600","5","Michael Behrisch","38551542600","Fraunhofer IGD, Germany, TU Darmstadt, Germany","","6","Jörn Kohlhamme","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042503","228","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042503/","I.5.3 [Computing Methodologies]: Pattern Recognition — Clustering","H.5.2 [Information Systems]: Information Interfaces and Presentation — User Interfaces","","","","","","","Uncertainty","Electronic mail","Data models","Optimization","Numerical models","Correlation","Educational institutions","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042503","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","8","227","Towards a user-defined visual-interactive definition of similarity functions for mixed data"
"The 2014 VAST Grand Challenge required us to find victims, suspects, and criminal motivations based on three separate dataseis. We developed three VA tools (AnnotatedTimeTree, Dodeca-Ring Map and SMART) to facilitate the understanding of heterogeneous multivariate dataseis. These tools were integrated to gain insights into the source data and find connections among complex information (Fig. 1). AnnotedTimeTree aims to identify the cause clues and timeline of kidnapping based on analysis of text and network data. Dodeca-Rings Map allows analysts to interact with geospatial, temporal, and card transaction data to find suspicious personal behaviors and social networks. SMART is a visual analytics tool that enables text stream analysis by dynamically visualizing microblog data on the map over time.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042538/","LOCKED","7042538","Computer Graphics Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085422417","1","Chen Guo","37085422417","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","State Key Lab of CAD & CG, Zhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085405113","2","Jing Xia","37085405113","Computer Graphics Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085411828","3","Jun Yu","37085411828","Electrical and Computer Engineering","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085454267","4","Jieqiong Zhao","37085454267","Electrical and Computer Engineering","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085404512","5","Jiawei Zhang","37085404512","Interaction Design, Purdue University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085554164","6","Qiaoying Wang","37085554164","Interaction Design, Purdue University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38238364000","7","Zhenyu Cheryl Qian","38238364000","Computer Graphics Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38241087200","8","Yingjie Victor Chen","38241087200","New Media Technology & Art, Harbin Institute of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085426720","9","Chen Wang","37085426720","Electrical and Computer Engineering","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282598900","10","David Ebert","37282598900","1","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042538","304","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042538/","[Human-centered computing]: visual analytics","geographic visualization","information visualization","[Information Systems]: spatial-temporal systems","","","","","Security","Visual analytics","Social network services","Electronic mail","Geology","Geospatial analysis","Computers","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042538","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","9","303","AnnotatedTimeTree, Dodeca-Rings Map & SMART: A geo-temporal analysis of criminal events"

"The VAST Challenge 2014 MC3 featured a dataset of roughly 4000 microblog messages and 200 emergency callcenter reports produced in the fictitious city of Abila. The task was to identify relevant events and outliers in the data and highlight observations that are connected to an earlier kidnapping of employees from a company called GASTECH. In contrast to earlier challenges, the focus was on real-time data processing. The microblog messages were hosted on a web-server that simulated real-time streaming of the data during a 4.5 hour period and the challenge participants had to monitor and analyze them as they were transmitted. To tackle the challenge we developed ScatterScopes, a real-time enabled visual analytics system that fosters understanding of ongoing events by means of spatiotemporal overview and hierarchical drilldown. Trends and anomalies in space, time and content can be quickly identified with the system using interactive maps, sentiment timelines and textual search. Once interesting or suspicious subsets of elements are selected, their inherent topic structure can be further dissected based on a highly interactive treemap of message clusters. Subset selection and recombination is furthermore supported by a filter-and-flow mechanism that can also be used to formulate and test hypotheses based on Boolean logic. ScatterScopes has been used by our team to successfully identify and describe all events hidden in the MC3 data streams.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042579/","LOCKED","7042579","Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems, University of Stuttgart","","1","Dennis Thorn","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems, University of Stuttgart","","2","Michael Wörner","","Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems, University of Stuttgart","","3","Steffen Koch","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042579","388","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042579/","User Interfaces","Information Search and Retrieval","Social Media","","","","","","Real-time systems","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Market research","Sentiment analysis","Urban areas","Monitoring","Visual analytics","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042579","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","15","387","ScatterScopes: Understanding events in real-time through spatiotemporal indication and hierarchical drilldown: VAST 2014 Mini Challenge 3 Recognition: ""Honorable mention for good support for situation awareness"""
"Numerous methods have been described that allow the visualization of the data-variable matrix. But all suffer from a common problem-visualizing the data and variable points separately which is hard for people to catch the relations in data and variables together. We describe a method that allows data and variables balanced layouts. We achieve it by combining two distance matrices typically used in isolation - the distance matrix encoding the similarities of the variables and the distance matrix encoding the similarity of the data points. The remaining two submatrices are obtained by creating a fused distance matrix - one that measures the distance of data points with respect to the variables or vice versa. We then use MDS to simultaneously optimize the placement of data points and variable points, producing a display that allows users to appreciate all three types of relationships in a single display: (1) the patterns of the collection of data items, (2) the patterns of the collection of variables, and (3) the relationships of data items with the variables and vice versa.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042507/","LOCKED","7042507","Visual Analytics and Imaging Lab, Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA and SUNY Korea, Songdo, Korea","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085387617","1","Shenghui Cheng","37085387617","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Visual Analytics and Imaging Lab, Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA and SUNY Korea, Songdo, Korea","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073902300","2","Bing Wang","37073902300","Visual Analytics and Imaging Lab, Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA and SUNY Korea, Songdo, Korea","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38025124400","3","Zhiyuan Zhang","38025124400","Visual Analytics and Imaging Lab, Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA and SUNY Korea, Songdo, Korea","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085389276","4","Klaus Mueller","37085389276","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042507","236","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042507/","","","","","","","","","Layout","Vectors","Data visualization","Symmetric matrices","Visual analytics","Encoding","Linear matrix inequalities","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042507","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","16","235","Balanced layouts using the composite data-variable matrix"

However, it is challenging to reveal patterns from the sparse and irregular sampling data. We proposed an interactive multi-filter visualization approach to analyze the spatial-temporal movement pattern in people's daily life. People's trajectories are visualized on the map with multiple functional layers.

In this poster, we present the preliminary results of Linea, a tool designed to help users build timelines that summarize content from Wikipedia. We combine Natural Language Processing and the PageRank algorithm to automatically build default timelines of any Wikipedia article, giving users a starting point for tailoring them. Then, users can interact with the event matrix - a collection of histograms of events - by exploring each matrix cell in search for peaks, i.e., proxies of important periods of time. By selecting a peak, the tool shows all events in that period so users are able to add or remove events, thus customizing timelines.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042513/","LOCKED","7042513","Modelo Inc.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37829389700","1","Tiago Etiene","37829389700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","UFMS","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37703681700","2","Paulo Pagliosa","37703681700","University of São Paulo","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590974800","3","Luis Gustavo Nonato","37590974800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042513","248","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042513/","Timeline","Text Summary","Event Matrix","Histogram","","","","","Histograms","Encyclopedias","Electronic publishing","Internet","Tag clouds","Educational institutions","","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042513","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","21","247","Linea: Tailoring timelines by visual exploration of temporal text"

Additionally, we visualize extracted topics using Tableau to construct a timeline of events surrounding the questions posed by the challenge.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042552/","LOCKED","7042552","Virginia Tech","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085357671","1","Ji Wang","37085357671","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Virginia Tech","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37071531400","2","Lauren Bradel","37071531400","Virginia Tech","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37419565900","3","Chris North","37419565900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042552","334","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042552/","Sensemaking","topic modelling","semantic interaction","event extraction","","","","","Visual analytics","Data mining","Semantics","Data models","Organizations","Resource management","","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042552","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","23","333","Event-based text visual analytics"
"Our research investigates the sensitivities and complexities of visualizing multivariate data over multiple scales with the consideration of local geography. We investigate this in the context of creating geodemographic classifications, where multivariate comparison for the variable selection process is an important, yet time-consuming and intensive process. We propose a visual interactive approach which allows skewed variables and those with strong correlations to be quickly identified and investigated and the geography of multi-scale correlation to be explored. Our objective is to present comprehensive documentation of the parameter space prior to the development of the visualization tools to help explore it.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042515/","LOCKED","7042515","giCentre, City University London","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077419200","1","Sarah Goodwin","37077419200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","giCentre, City University London","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37605079900","2","Jason Dykes","37605079900","giCentre, City University London","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590960700","3","Aidan Slingsby","37590960700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042515","252","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042515/","D.2.2 [Software Engineering]: Design Tools and Techniques","I.5.2 [Pattern Recognition]: Design Methodology — Feature Evaluation and Selection","","","","","","","Correlation","Geography","Encoding","Image color analysis","Data visualization","Visualization","Input variables","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042515","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","24","251","Visualizing the effects of scale and geography in multivariate comparison"
"Investigation of critical events requires dealing with heterogeneous document collections, and is usually done case by case. We address the case of VAST Challenge 2014 Mini-Challenge 1 with the two views of our AnnotatedTimeTree system: the document view and the GAStech view. The document view is a novel AnnotatedTimeTree design for current and historical news reports in Kronos; and the GAStech view is implemented specifically for GAStech employee profiles and email activities. Together the two views facilitate rapid summarization of both crucial events in Kronos history and GAStech employees in Mini Challenge 1. The AnnotatedTimeTree design provides semantic interactions such as searching, highlighting, annotating and expanding for maintaining reasoning process and reasoning results to the documents.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042554/","LOCKED","7042554","State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085405113","1","Jing Xia","37085405113","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Purdue Univeristy in West Lafayette, IN, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085454267","2","Jieqiong Zhao","37085454267","Purdue Univeristy in West Lafayette, IN, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085547786","3","Isaac Sheeley","37085547786","Purdue Univeristy in West Lafayette, IN, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085551254","4","Joseph Christopher","37085551254","Purdue Univeristy in West Lafayette, IN, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085554164","5","Qiaoying Wang","37085554164","Purdue Univeristy in West Lafayette, IN, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085422417","6","Chen Guo","37085422417","Purdue Univeristy in West Lafayette, IN, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085404512","7","Jiawei Zhang","37085404512","Purdue Univeristy in West Lafayette, IN, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282598900","8","David S.

"Tumor tissue characterization can play an important role in the diagnosis and design of effective treatment strategies. In order to gather and combine the necessary tissue information, multi-modal imaging is used to derive a number of parameters indicative of tissue properties. The exploration and analysis of relationships between parameters and, especially, of differences among distinct intra-tumor regions is particularly interesting for clinical researchers to individualize tumor treatment. However, due to high data dimensionality and complexity, the current clinical workflow is time demanding and does not provide the necessary intra-tumor insight. We implemented a new application for the exploration of the relationships between parameters and heterogeneity within tumors. In our approach, we employ a well-known dimensionality reduction technique [5] to map the high-dimensional space of tissue properties into a 2D information space that can be interactively explored with integrated information visualization techniques. We conducted several usage scenarios with real-patient data, of which we present a case of advanced cervical cancer. First indications show that our application introduces new features and functionalities that are not available within the current clinical approach.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042521/","LOCKED","7042521","Eindhoven University of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085466510","1","Renata Georgia Raidou","37085466510","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Eindhoven University of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085472610","2","Marta Paes Moreira","37085472610","MAASTRO Clinic Eindhoven University of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085474302","3","Wouter van Elmpt","37085474302","Philips Healthcare Best Eindhoven University of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37374875300","4","Marcel Breeuwer","37374875300","Delft University of Technology Eindhoven University of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282551500","5","Anna Vilanova","37282551500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042521","264","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042521/","I.3.8 [Computer Graphics]: Applications — Applications","J.3 [Computer Applications]: Life and Medical Sciences — Life and Medical Sciences","","","","","","","Tumors","Educational institutions","Biomedical imaging","Visual analytics","Cancer","","","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042521","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","27","263","Visual analytics for the exploration of multiparametric cancer imaging"
"Repeatedly visited personal and public places were extracted from trajectories by finding spatial clusters of stop points. Temporal patterns of people's presence in the places resulted from spatio-temporal aggregation of the data by the places and hourly intervals within the weekly cycle. Based on these patterns, we identified the meanings or purposes of the places: home, work, breakfast or coffee, lunch and dinner, and dinner or shopping. Meanings of some places could be refined using the credit card transaction data. By representing the place meanings as points on a 2D plane, we built an abstract semantic space and transformed the original trajectories to trajectories in the semantic space. Spatio-temporal aggregation of the transformed trajectories into flows between the semantic places and subsequent clustering of time intervals by the similarity of the flow situations allowed us to reveal the routine movement behaviors. To detect anomalies, we (a) investigated the visits to the places with unknown meanings, and (b) looked for unusual presence times or visit durations at different semantic places. The analysis is scalable since all tools and methods can be applied to much larger data.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042556/","LOCKED","7042556","Fraunhofer Institute lAIS","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047700","1","Natalia Andrienko","37283047700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Fraunhofer Institute lAIS","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283047100","2","Gennady Andrienko","37283047100","Fraunhofer Institute lAIS","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283008400","3","Georg Fuchs","37283008400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042556","342","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042556/","","","","","","","","","Semantics","Trajectory","Data mining","Histograms","Filtering","Urban areas","Credit cards","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042556","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","28","341","Analysis of mobility behaviors in geographic and semantic spaces"
"Given vehicle tracking data, loyalty and credit card logs of employees from a fictitious company, GAStech, participants of VAST 2014 mini challenge 2 were tasked to extract the common daily routine of employees and identify any suspicious activities that may be present in the data. In this paper, we reflect on our analysis procedure focusing on each step of the process that contributed to problem solving. Accordingly, we describe the features incorporated into our software at each stage of the process and justify the design decisions that were made. Inspired by DiBiase's approach to visual analysis [1], our procedure consists of three stages (Fig. 1). With off-the-shelf software, such as R and QGIS, we conducted exploratory data analysis [2] to generate a diverse range of insights. The insights were evaluated based on their relevance to the given task. They were used to formulate hypotheses and data task abstraction [3] resulting in a set of complementary tools comprising of an origin-destination map, a timeline and a flow diagram that we developed in processing. These tools were not designed to function as an integrated software package but were treated as rapid prototypes that would afford more flexibility in the design and development cycle [4].","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042560/","LOCKED","7042560","Datavis Lab, University of Leuven, Belgium","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085372051","1","Alvin Chua","37085372051","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Datavis Lab, University of Leuven, Belgium","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085379580","2","Ryo Sakai","37085379580","Datavis Lab, University of Leuven, Belgium","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085389683","3","Jan Aerts","37085389683","Datavis Lab, University of Leuven, Belgium","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283186600","4","Andrew Vande Moere","37283186600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042560","350","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042560/","","","","","","","","","Data visualization","Credit cards","Electronic mail","Splines (mathematics)","Software","Visualization","Employment","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042560","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","29","349","A three step process to design visualisations for GeoTemporal analysis (VAST 2014 Mini Challenge 2)"
"Stance in human communication is a linguistic concept relating to expressions of subjectivity such as the speakers' attitudes and emotions. Taking stance is crucial for the social construction of meaning and can be useful for many application fields such as business intelligence, security analytics, or social media monitoring. In order to process large amounts of text data for stance analyses, linguists need interactive tools to explore the textual sources as well as the results of computational linguistics techniques. Both aspects are important for refining the analyses iteratively. In this work, we present a visual analytics tool for online social media text data and corresponding time-series that can be used to investigate stance phenomena and to refine the so-called stance markers collection.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042519/","LOCKED","7042519","Linnaeus University, Sweden","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085483907","1","Kostiantyn Kucher","37085483907","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Linnaeus University, Sweden","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282717800","2","Andreas Kerren","37282717800","Lund University, Sweden","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37887982700","3","Carita Paradis","37887982700","Gavagai AB, Sweden","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085500246","4","Magnus Sahlgren","37085500246","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042519","260","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042519/","Visualization","text visualization","interaction","time-series","stance analysis","sentiment analysis","NLP","text analytics","Media","Data visualization","Observers","Sentiment analysis","Pragmatics","Electronic mail","","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042519","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","30","259","Visual analysis of stance markers in online social media"

"The ability to discover illicit behavior in complex, heterogeneous data is a daunting problem. In the VAST 2014 competition, one of the challenges involves identifying for local law enforcement which employees are involved and where they should be concentrating their efforts. One approach to handling this problem is a graph-based approach. In this paper, we present a graph-based anomaly detection approach for discovering suspicious employees and geographic locations.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042564/","LOCKED","7042564","Tennessee Tech University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085525443","1","Lenin Mookiah","37085525443","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Tennessee Tech University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37573606300","2","William Eberle","37573606300","Washington State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37347302800","3","Lawrence Holder","37347302800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042564","358","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042564/","graph-based anomaly detection","knowledge discovery","","","","","","","Global Positioning System","Clustering algorithms","Law enforcement","Probabilistic logic","Knowledge discovery","Indexes","","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042564","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","35","357","Detecting suspicious behavior using a graph-based approach"

Email re-finding tasks can be challenging, involving scanning of many emails and modifying the query as the search progresses. We designed mailVis for such tasks in which the user would benefit from having memory clues and multiple options to direct the search. During the design process, we devised a novel interaction technique, filter swipe, that combines filtering and selection into one action for rapidly skimming individual items in a data set.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042527/","LOCKED","7042527","Helsinki Institute for Information Technology HIIT, Department of Computer Science, University of Helsinki","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085573191","1","Banş Serim","37085573191","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Helsinki Institute for Information Technology HIIT, Department of Computer Science, University of Helsinki","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085575312","2","Vuong Thanh Tung","37085575312","Helsinki Institute for Information Technology HIIT, Aalto University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37705108800","3","Tuukka Ruotsalo","37705108800","Helsinki Institute for Information Technology HIIT, Aalto University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490161300","4","Luana Micallef","38490161300","Helsinki Institute for Information Technology HIIT, Department of Computer Science, University of Helsinki","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586709000","5","Giulio Jacucci","37586709000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042527","276","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042527/","Email","Interactive Visualization","Input Techniques","Selection","Faceted Search","","","","Electronic mail","Visualization","Filtering","Presses","Data visualization","Educational institutions","Navigation","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042527","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","36","275","mailVis: Visualizing emailbox for re-finding emails"

The Care and Condition Monitor (CCM) is a tablet-based, networked visual analytics tool for collecting, structuring and analyzing informal and qualitative healthcare data and visualizing it in a circular format. It illustrates how social communication within teams of caregivers enables capturing of longitudinal informal data that can (a) result in rich and meaningful information visualizations, (b) improve comprehension of healthcare data and changes in condition over time, and (c) support medical decision making.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042529/","LOCKED","7042529","OCAD University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085567005","1","Anne Stevens","37085567005","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","OCAD University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085582005","2","Hudson Pridham","37085582005","OCAD University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085580710","3","Steve Szigeti","37085580710","OCAD University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085576252","4","Sara Diamond","37085576252","OCAD University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085584497","5","Bhuvaneswari Arunchalan","37085584497","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042529","280","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042529/","Health informatics","informal data","long term care","mobile platforms","qualitative data","visual analytics","","","Data visualization","Measurement","Medical services","Image color analysis","Context","Visual analytics","Educational institutions","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042529","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","40","279","The care and condition monitor: Designing a tablet based tool for visualizing informal qualitative healthcare data"

Tanahashi and Ma proposed some considerations on the design of the storyline visualization and automation became meaningful because of its aesthetic and clear representation style [2]. Shixia Liu and Yingcai Wu's StoryFlow had become the next step in storyline visualization [3]. With the efficient optimization approach on automation, representation of the complex stories became efficient and enabled users to track and understand the story easier. In all cases before generating the visualizations, an input file must be created manually.

We make use of various modern technologies like Apache Spark and others to provide high scalability and incorporate new technologies and show their use within visual analytics applications. Furthermore, we developed a web application, called NVisAware, to analyze and visualize data streams to help the analyst to focus on the most important time segments. We extracted so-called sliding slices, which are aggregated summaries calculated on a sliding window and represent them in a small-multiple like visualization containing various small visualizations (e.g., word clouds) to present an overview of the current time segment.

After the event happened, however, it is difficult to gather past conversations from those platforms and link them to the speech to relive the moment. To address this we developed a visualization technique that leverages the real-time conversational aspect of the Twitter platform to enrich the text of a public presentation with the discussion on Twitter during that speech; creating an annotated visual narrative of an event that can be replayed as the user scans the text of the speech.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042502/","LOCKED","7042502","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085514338","1","Nicolas Garcia Belmonte","37085514338","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042502","226","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042502/","Text mining","real-time","streamgraph","Twitter","Tweet","","","","Twitter","Speech","Real-time systems","Data visualization","Visualization","Standards","","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042502","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","49","225","Extracting and visualizing insights from real-time conversations around public presentations"

"The research field of Process Mining deals with the extraction of information from event logs. Since large amounts of event data are generated every day, analyzing these often unstructured event logs poses a research challenge. To cope with the complexity of the data and the associated mining tasks, appropriate visualizations and interactive means are needed. We present our early prototype for the visual exploration of event sequences and patterns. Our approach combines (1) a visual representation of event sequences emphasizing recurring event patterns, (2) automated pattern mining methods, as well as (3) interactive means for exploration. We provide first steps to support browsing event logs in an interactive environment and to facilitate the inspection of recurring pattern locations within the context of the surrounding events.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042504/","LOCKED","7042504","Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria","","1","Peter Bodesinsky","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria","","2","Bilal Alsallakh","","Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria","","3","Theresia Gschwandtner","","Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria","","4","Silvia Miksch","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042504","230","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042504/","","","","","","","","","Data mining","Visualization","Prototypes","Data visualization","Sorting","Business","Inspection","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042504","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","54","229","Visual process mining: Event data exploration and analysis"

"Socio-emotional communication is a critical determining factor in the cohesiveness of international work teams. In recent years, online text communication (e.g., chat, forums, email) has been widely used in cross-cultural collaborations, and emoticons are often viewed as socio-emotional cues in this type of communication. Therefore, it is important to know how emoticons work in online text communication. One way to investigate this topic is to leverage theories in sociolinguistics to find potential mappings between emoticon use and face-to-face language use. In the present work, we propose a visual analytics tool to explore emoticon use among different groups over time and show how visual analytics can elicit storytelling in studying linguistic alignment of emoticons in a chat log dataset from a four-year scientific collaboration between France and the United States.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042508/","LOCKED","7042508","University of Washington","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085341619","1","Nan-Chen Chen","37085341619","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","The University at Albany-SUNY","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085356080","2","Laurie Beth Feldman","37085356080","Pennsylvania State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085359783","3","Judith F.

"A recurrent problem in biological image analysis is to quantify the number and size of spots on a homogeneous background. Most automated approaches rely on segmenting the individual spots, which becomes unreliable when the image contains artifacts, noise, or confounding objects. Therefore, practitioners often resort to tedious and time-consuming manual counting and measurements. As an alternative, we propose a visual analytics approach to this problem. It is based on Total Variation Flow, a partial differential equation that changes the intensities of image regions at a rate inverse to their scale. From this, we derive novel quantitative per-pixel measures of scale and density, and we show how the results can be combined with tools for visualization and selection to achieve a fast summary of median size and spot density in an image. Given a set of images, our framework places them on a 2D map that makes it easy to quickly compare them with respect to spot sizes and density. Our system is applied to real-world data from Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042516/","LOCKED","7042516","University of Bonn, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38242231300","1","Max Hermann","38242231300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Bonn, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271619700","2","Reinhard Klein","37271619700","MPI for Intelligent Systems, Tübingen, Germany University of Bonn, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37606352800","3","Thomas Schultz","37606352800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042516","254","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042516/","","","","","","","","","TV","Image segmentation","Noise","Size measurement","Educational institutions","Visual analytics","Density measurement","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042516","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","69","253","Segmentation-free quantification of spots on a homogeneous background"
"The visualization of space-time trajectory data is challenging due to the fact that, in most cases, the data inherently exists in more than two dimensions. In many space-time visualizations, additional variables must be mapped into other visual attributes such as color or size. Given that substantive analyses of trajectory data will likely be concerned with variables beyond space and time, we propose a method that allows trajectory positions to be determined by an arbitrary number of variables in a multi-dimensional space-time dataset. Our method is based on Star Coordinates [5], a prior technique for interactively positioning multi-dimensional data. Our technique is catered specifically to multi-dimensional space-time trajectory data. The technique is demonstrated using a large multidimensional space-time dataset related to touring musicians.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042520/","LOCKED","7042520","University of Illinois at Chicago","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085423169","1","Paul Murray","37085423169","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Illinois at Chicago","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38180697500","2","Angus Forbes","38180697500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042520","262","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042520/","","","","","","","","","Trajectory","Data visualization","Vectors","Visualization","Image color analysis","Market research","Educational institutions","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042520","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","70","261","StretchPlot: Interactive visualization of multi-dimensional trajectory data"

"Reconstructing processes from measurements of multiple sensors over time is an important task in many application domains. For the reconstruction, these multivariate time-series can be automatically processed. However, the outcomes of automated algorithms often vary in quality and show strong parameter dependencies, making manual inspections and adjustments of the results necessary. We propose a visual analysis approach to support the user in understanding parameters' influences on these results. With our approach the user can identify and select parameter settings that meet certain quality criteria. The proposed visual and interactive design helps to identify relationships and temporal patterns, supports subsequent decision making, and promotes higher accuracy as well as confidence in the results.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042524/","LOCKED","7042524","University of Rostock","","1","Martin Röhlig","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Rostock","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37869995900","2","Martin Luboschik","37869995900","University of Rostock","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283240400","3","Heidrun Schumann","37283240400","Vienna University of Technology","","4","Markus Bögl","","Vienna University of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38242873200","5","Bilal Alsallakh","38242873200","Vienna University of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282584500","6","Silvia Miksch","37282584500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042524","270","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042524/","","","","","","","","","Labeling","Visualization","Compounds","Image color analysis","Accuracy","Time series analysis","Data visualization","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042524","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","76","269","Analyzing parameter influence on time-series segmentation and labeling"

"When analysts work in a distributed fashion, they need to understand what their collaborators have done and what avenues of analysis remain uninvestigated. Although visualization history has the potential to communicate such information, the common representations are often limited to sequential lists of past work. Such representations do not make it easy to understand the analytic coverage of the dimension space (i.e. which dimensions have been investigated and which have not). This makes it difficult for an analyst to plan their next steps, particularly when the number of dimensions is large. In this paper, we propose representing the prior analysis from a dimension coverage perspective. Dimension view provides a unique perspective that can facilitate exploratory analysis by enabling analysts to easily identify what dimensions have been examined and in what combinations. We hypothesize that addition of this view to common representations of visualization history will reduce cognitive and interaction costs by helping the analyst to discover data subsets to explore. We studied the effects of this view on a distributed collaborative visualization process. Our findings show that providing views of the dimension and data space reduces time required for identifying and investigating unexplored regions and increases the accuracy of this understanding. In addition, providing these views results in a larger coverage of entire dimension space.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042526/","LOCKED","7042526","University of Victoria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591344300","1","Ali Sarvghad","37591344300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Victoria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275861300","2","Melanie Tory","37275861300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042526","274","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042526/","Analysis History","Distributed Collaboration","Information Scent","Dimension Space Coverage","","","","","History","Data visualization","Collaboration","Prototypes","Data analysis","Visualization","Navigation","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042526","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","79","273","Exploiting history to reduce interaction costs in collaborative analysis"
"Modeling propagation dynamics on networks is an amazingly fertile and active area of research. Roughly speaking, network models aim at gaining a better understanding of how actors influence the overall network behaviour through their individual actions. However, considering the extended literature surrounding the subject, one is entitled to think that moving beyond the state-of-the-art in network modeling requires the ability to compare models, or consider slight variations of a model. This requires having a common language describing all considered models, allowing to objectively compare them and unfold their inherent properties and complexity. This also assumes users can easily run models, steer them and interactively evaluate their performance and behaviour. The approach we describe aims at providing a framework turning network propagation modeling into rule-based modeling (aka graph rewriting). That is, models are described as a set of algorithmic transformation rules acting locally. Our approach has partially been validated by providing such a description of a well-known model relying on probabilistic rules, where nodes trigger actions depending on their neighbor's influences. The results so obtained confirm rule-based modeling as a promising avenue. The use of a visual analytics framework to conduct such tasks is vital and motivated us to further develop and adapt a general purpose visual analytics system for graph rewriting to the particular case of network propagation.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042530/","LOCKED","7042530","University of Bordeaux, CNRS UMR 5800 LaBRI, Talence, France","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085566227","1","Jason Vallet","37085566227","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Bordeaux, CNRS UMR 5800 LaBRI, Talence, France","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396011000","2","Bruno Pinaud","37396011000","University of Bordeaux, CNRS UMR 5800 LaBRI, Talence, France","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283186100","3","Guy Melançon","37283186100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042530","282","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042530/","I.2.4 [Artificial Intelligence]: Knowledge Representation — Formalisms and Methods","F.1.2 [Computation by Abstract Devices]: Modes of Computation","","","","","","","Mathematical model","Computational modeling","Analytical models","Visual analytics","Data mining","Adaptation models","","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042530","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","80","281","Studying propagation dynamics in networks through rule-based modeling"

"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are becoming increasingly popular and have attracted much research attention. Analyzing clickstreams on MOOC videos poses a special analytical challenge but provides a good opportunity for understanding how students interact with course videos, which in turn can help instructors and educational analysts gain insights into online learning behavior. In this poster, we develop a visual analytical system, VisMOOC, to help instructors analyze the clickstream data. VisMOOC consists of three main views: the List View to list all course videos for analysts to select the video they are interested in; the Content-based View to show how each type of click actions change along the video timeline, which enables the most viewed sections to be observed and the most interesting patterns to be discovered; The Dashboard View shows the information of the clickstream data in different aspects, including the course information, the geographic distribution, the video temporal information, the video popularity, and the animation. Furthermore, case studies made by the instructors demonstrate the usefulness of VisMOOC and helped them gaining deep insights into learning behavior for MOOCs.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042528/","LOCKED","7042528","CSE Department, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38019494400","1","Conglei Shi","38019494400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CSE Department, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085458481","2","Siwei Fu","37085458481","CSE Department, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085471103","3","Qing Chen","37085471103","CSE Department, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","4","Huamin Qu","37272637300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","13","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042528","278","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042528/","","","","","","","","","Visualization","Data visualization","Animation","Image color analysis","Presses","Abstracts","Streaming media","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042528","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","82","277","VisMOOC: Visualizing video clickstream data from massive open online courses"
"Sequential pattern mining aims to discover valuable patterns from datasets and has a vast number of applications in various fields. Due to the combinatorial nature of the problem, the existing algorithms tend to output long lists of patterns that often suffer from a lack of focus from the user perspective. Our aim is to tackle this problem by combining interactive visualization techniques with sequential pattern mining to create a ""transparent box"" execution model for existing algorithms. This paper describes our first step in this direction and gives an overview of a system that allows the user to guide the execution of a pattern-growth algorithm at suitable points, through a powerful visual interface.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042532/","LOCKED","7042532","Linköping University, Sweden","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37939017400","1","Katerina Vrotsou","37939017400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Linköping University, Sweden","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085462332","2","Aida Nordman","37085462332","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042532","286","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042532/","H.5.2: User Interfaces","H.2.8: Data mining","","","","","","","Data mining","Visualization","Educational institutions","Databases","Heuristic algorithms","User interfaces","","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042532","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","83","285","Interactive visual sequence mining based on pattern-growth"

"Soccer is one the most popular sports today and also very interesting from an scientific point of view. We present a system for analyzing high-frequency position-based soccer data at various levels of detail, allowing to interactively explore and analyze for movement features and game events. Our Visual Analytics method covers single-player, multi-player and event-based analytical views. Depending on the task the most promising features are semi-automatically selected, processed, and visualized. Our aim is to help soccer analysts in finding the most important and interesting events in a match. We present a flexible, modular, and expandable layer-based system allowing in-depth analysis. The integration of Visual Analytics techniques into the analysis process enables the analyst to find interesting events based on classification and allows, by a set of custom views, to communicate the found results. The feedback loop in the Visual Analytics pipeline helps to further improve the classification results. We evaluate our approach by investigating real-world soccer matches and collecting additional expert feedback. Several use cases and findings illustrate the capabilities of our approach.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042477/","LOCKED","7042477","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37594026300","1","Halld'or Janetzko","37594026300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085566394","2","Dominik Sacha","37085566394","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085573450","3","Manuel Stein","37085573450","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282557600","4","Tobias Schreck","37282557600","University of Konstanz","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085433386","5","Daniel A.

"For cancers such as glioblastoma multiforme, there is an increasing interest in defining ""biological target volumes"" (BTV), high tumour-burden regions which may be targeted with dose boosts in radiotherapy. The definition of a BTV requires insight into tumour characteristics going beyond conventionally defined radiological abnormalities and anatomical features. Molecular and biochemical imaging techniques, like positron emission tomography, the use of Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging contrast agents or MR Spectroscopy deliver this information and support BTV delineation. MR Spectroscopy Imaging (MRSI) is the only non-invasive technique in this list. Studies with MRSI have shown that voxels with certain metabolic signatures are more susceptible to predict the site of relapse. Nevertheless, the discovery of complex relationships between a high number of different metabolites, anatomical, molecular and functional features is an ongoing topic of research - still lacking appropriate tools supporting a smooth workflow by providing data integration and fusion of MRSI data with other imaging modalities. We present a solution bridging this gap which gives fast and flexible access to all data at once. By integrating a customized visualization of the multi-modal and multi-variate image data with a highly flexible visual analytics (VA) framework, it is for the first time possible to interactively fuse, visualize and explore user defined metabolite relations derived from MRSI in combination with markers delivered by other imaging modalities. Real-world medical cases demonstrate the utility of our solution. By making MRSI data available both in a VA tool and in a multi-modal visualization renderer we can combine insights from each side to arrive at a superior BTV delineation. We also report feedback from domain experts indicating significant positive impact in how this work can improve the understanding of MRSI data and its integration into radiotherapy planning.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042481/","LOCKED","7042481","VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085586373","1","Miguel Nunes","37085586373","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institut Claudius Regaud, Toulouse, France","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37075302800","2","Benjamin Rowland","37075302800","VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37976622700","3","Matthias Schlachter","37976622700","Institut Claudius Regaud, Toulouse, France","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37075211700","4","Soléakhéna Ken","37075211700","VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37947312900","5","Kresimir Matkovic","37947312900","Institut Claudius Regaud, Toulouse, France","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37075400700","6","Anne Laprie","37075400700","VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267821300","7","Katja Bühler","37267821300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042481","62","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042481/","MR spectroscopy","cancer","brain","visualization","multi-modality data","radiotherapy planning","medical decision support systems","","Data visualization","Biomedical imaging","Tumors","Brushes","Planning","Spectroscopy","","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042481","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","88","53","An integrated visual analysis system for fusing MR spectroscopy and multi-modal radiology imaging"
"Analysis of radio transmissions is vital for military defense as it provides valuable information about enemy communication and infrastructure. One challenge to the data analysis task is that there are far too many signals for analysts to go through by hand. Even typical signal meta data (such as frequency band, duration, and geographic location) can be overwhelming. In this paper, we present a system for exploring and analyzing such radio signal meta-data. Our system incorporates several visual representations for signal data, designed for readability and ease of comparison, as well as novel algorithms for extracting and classifying consistent signal patterns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system using data collected from real missions with an airborne sensor platform.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042479/","LOCKED","7042479","VIDi @ U.

"We created a pixel map for multivariate data based on an analysis of the needs of network security engineers. Parameters of a log record are shown as pixels and these pixels are stacked to represent a record. This allows a broad view of a data set on one screen while staying very close to the raw data and to expose common and rare patterns of user behavior through the visualization itself (the ""Carpet""). Visualizations that immediately point to areas of suspicious activity without requiring extensive filtering, help network engineers investigating unknown computer security incidents. Most of them, however, have limited knowledge of advanced visualization techniques, while many designers and data scientists are unfamiliar with computer security topics. To bridge this gap, we developed visualizations together with engineers, following a co-creative process. We will show how we explored the scope of the engineers' tasks and how we jointly developed ideas and designs. Our expert evaluation indicates that this visualization helps to scan large parts of log files quickly and to define areas of interest for closer inspection.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042483/","LOCKED","7042483","Department of Design at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37706669700","1","Johannes Landstorfer","37706669700","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Department of Design at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085494402","2","Ivo Herrmann","37085494402","Department of Design at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085494381","3","Jan-Erik Stange","37085494381","Department of Design at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590950400","4","Marian Dörk","37590950400","Department of Design at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37671134300","5","Reto Wettach","37671134300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","9","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042483","82","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042483/","Pixel-oriented techniques","task and requirements analysis","multidimensional data","network security and intrusion","","","","","Visual analytics","","","","","","","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042483","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","90","73","Weaving a carpet from log entries: A network security visualization built with co-creation"
"Proteins are essential parts in all living organisms. They consist of sequences of amino acids. An interaction with reactive agent can stimulate a mutation at a specific position in the sequence. This mutation may set off a chain reaction, which effects other amino acids in the protein. Chain reactions need to be analyzed, as they may invoke unwanted side effects in drug treatment. A mutation chain is represented by a directed acyclic graph, where amino acids are connected by their mutation dependencies. As each amino acid may mutate individually, many mutation graphs exist. To determine important impacts of mutations, experts need to analyze and compare common patterns in these mutations graphs. Experts, however, lack suitable tools for this purpose. We present a new system for the search and the exploration of frequent patterns (i.e., motifs) in mutation graphs. We present a fast pattern search algorithm specifically developed for finding biologically relevant patterns in many mutation graphs (i.e., many labeled acyclic directed graphs). Our visualization system allows an interactive exploration and comparison of the found patterns. It enables locating the found patterns in the mutation graphs and in the 3D protein structures. In this way, potentially interesting patterns can be discovered. These patterns serve as starting point for a further biological analysis. In cooperation with biologists, we use our approach for analyzing a real world data set based on multiple HIV protease sequences.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042485/","LOCKED","7042485","GRIS, TU Darmstadt","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085594991","1","Olav Lenz","37085594991","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Computational Biology, TU Darmstadt","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085588817","2","Frank Keul","37085588817","GRIS, TU Darmstadt","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586274500","3","Sebastian Bremm","37586274500","Computational Biology, TU Darmstadt","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085594999","4","Kay Hamacher","37085594999","GRIS, TU Darmstadt","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586276100","5","Tatiana von Landesberger","37586276100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042485","102","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042485/","Biologic Visualization","Graph Visualization","Motif Search","Motif Visualization","Biology","Mutations","Pattern Visualization","","Amino acids","Visualization","Proteins","Drugs","Three-dimensional displays","Algorithm design and analysis","","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042485","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","91","93","Visual analysis of patterns in multiple amino acid mutation graphs"
"Logging user activities is essential to data analysis for internet products and services. Twitter has built a unified logging infrastructure that captures user activities across all clients it owns, making it one of the largest datasets in the organization. This paper describes challenges and opportunities in applying information visualization to log analysis at this massive scale, and shows how various visualization techniques can be adapted to help data scientists extract insights. In particular, we focus on two scenarios: (1) monitoring and exploring a large collection of log events, and (2) performing visual funnel analysis on log data with tens of thousands of event types. Two interactive visualizations were developed for these purposes: we discuss design choices and the implementation of these systems, along with case studies of how they are being used in day-to-day operations at Twitter.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042487/","LOCKED","7042487","Twitter, Inc.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37670523200","1","Krist Wongsuphasawat","37670523200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Twitter, Inc.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085579678","2","Jimmy Lin","37085579678","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","13","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042487","122","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042487/","Information Visualization","Visual Analytics","Log Analysis","Log Visualization","Session Analysis","Funnel Analysis","","","Data visualization","Twitter","Radar","Monitoring","Visualization","Vegetation","Data analysis","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042487","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","92","113","Using visualizations to monitor changes and harvest insights from a global-scale logging infrastructure at Twitter"
"Polygonal meshes can be created in several different ways. In this paper we focus on the reconstruction of meshes from point clouds, which are sets of points in 3D. Several algorithms that tackle this task already exist, but they have different benefits and drawbacks, which leads to a large number of possible reconstruction results (i.e., meshes). The evaluation of those techniques requires extensive comparisons between different meshes which is up to now done by either placing images of rendered meshes side-by-side, or by encoding differences by heat maps. A major drawback of both approaches is that they do not scale well with the number of meshes. This paper introduces a new comparative visual analysis technique for 3D meshes which enables the simultaneous comparison of several meshes and allows for the interactive exploration of their differences. Our approach gives an overview of the differences of the input meshes in a 2D view. By selecting certain areas of interest, the user can switch to a 3D representation and explore the spatial differences in detail. To inspect local variations, we provide a magic lens tool in 3D. The location and size of the lens provide further information on the variations of the reconstructions in the selected area. With our comparative visualization approach, differences between several mesh reconstruction algorithms can be easily localized and inspected.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042491/","LOCKED","7042491","Vienna University of Technology, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077239600","1","Johanna Schmidt","37077239600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Vienna University of Technology, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085534574","2","Reinhold Preiner","37085534574","Vienna University of Technology, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233357100","3","Thomas Auzinger","38233357100","Vienna University of Technology, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38191309900","4","Michael Wimmer","38191309900","Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282552200","5","M.

"We present a new approach to visualizing the climate data of multi-dimensional, time-series, and geo-related characteristics. Our approach integrates three new highly interrelated visualization techniques, and uses the same input data types as in the traditional model-based analysis methods. As the main visualization view, Global Radial Map is used to identify the overall state of climate changes and provide users with a compact and intuitive view for analyzing spatial and temporal patterns at the same time. Other two visualization techniques, providing complementary views, are specialized in analysing time trend and detecting abnormal cases, which are two important analysis tasks in any climate change study. Case studies and expert reviews have been conducted, through which the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed approach has been confirmed.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042489/","LOCKED","7042489","School of Computer Science and Technology, Tianjin University, and National Ocean Technology Center, Tianjin, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085431300","1","Jie Li","37085431300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Department of Computer Science, The University of Texas at Dallas, USA","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37277192000","2","Kang Zhang","37277192000","School of Computer Software, Tianjin University, China","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085382201","3","Zhao-Peng Meng","37085382201","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042489","142","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042489/","Climate changes","spatiotemporal visualization","station-based observation data","radial layout","visual analytics","","","","Data visualization","Meteorology","Time series analysis","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Image color analysis","Visualization","Layout","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042489","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","94","133","Vismate: Interactive visual analysis of station-based observation data on climate changes"
"Exploration and discovery in a large text corpus requires investigation at multiple levels of abstraction, from a zoomed-out view of the entire corpus down to close-ups of individual passages and words. At each of these levels, there is a wealth of information that can inform inquiry - from statistical models, to metadata, to the researcher's own knowledge and expertise. Joining all this information together can be a challenge, and there are issues of scale to be combatted along the way. In this paper, we describe an approach to text analysis that addresses these challenges of scale and multiple information sources, using probabilistic topic models to structure exploration through multiple levels of inquiry in a way that fosters serendipitous discovery. In implementing this approach into a tool called Serendip, we incorporate topic model data and metadata into a highly reorderable matrix to expose corpus level trends; extend encodings of tagged text to illustrate probabilistic information at a passage level; and introduce a technique for visualizing individual word rankings, along with interaction techniques and new statistical methods to create links between different levels and information types. We describe example uses from both the humanities and visualization research that illustrate the benefits of our approach.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042493/","LOCKED","7042493","Department of Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085354962","1","Eric Alexander","37085354962","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Department of Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38232562600","2","Joe Kohlmann","38232562600","Department of English at the University of Wisconsin-Madison","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085342629","3","Robin Valenza","37085342629","Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.

"A key analytical task across many domains is model building and exploration for predictive analysis. Data is collected, parsed and analyzed for relationships, and features are selected and mapped to estimate the response of a system under exploration. As social media data has grown more abundant, data can be captured that may potentially represent behavioral patterns in society. In turn, this unstructured social media data can be parsed and integrated as a key factor for predictive intelligence. In this paper, we present a framework for the development of predictive models utilizing social media data. We combine feature selection mechanisms, similarity comparisons and model cross-validation through a variety of interactive visualizations to support analysts in model building and prediction. In order to explore how predictions might be performed in such a framework, we present results from a user study focusing on social media data as a predictor for movie box-office success.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042495/","LOCKED","7042495","Arizona State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085342409","1","Yafeng Lu","37085342409","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Stuttgart, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077786200","2","Robert Krüger","37077786200","University of Stuttgart, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233559700","3","Dennis Thom","38233559700","Arizona State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085369135","4","Feng Wang","37085369135","University of Stuttgart, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37593029700","5","Steffen Koch","37593029700","University of Stuttgart, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085368197","6","Thomas Ertl","37085368197","Arizona State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37396008400","7","Ross Maciejewski","37396008400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","24","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042495","202","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042495/","Social Media","Predictive Analytics","Feature Selection","","","","","","Motion pictures","Media","Analytical models","Predictive models","Twitter","YouTube","Correlation","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042495","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","96","193","Integrating predictive analytics and social media"
"The size and importance of visual multimedia collections grew rapidly over the last years, creating a need for sophisticated multimedia analytics systems enabling large-scale, interactive, and insightful analysis. These systems need to integrate the human's natural expertise in analyzing multimedia with the machine's ability to process large-scale data. The paper starts off with a comprehensive overview of representation, learning, and interaction techniques from both the human's and the machine's point of view. To this end, hundreds of references from the related disciplines (visual analytics, information visualization, computer vision, multimedia information retrieval) have been surveyed. Based on the survey, a novel general multimedia analytics model is synthesized. In the model, the need for semantic navigation of the collection is emphasized and multimedia analytics tasks are placed on the exploration-search axis. The axis is composed of both exploration and search in a certain proportion which changes as the analyst progresses towards insight. Categorization is proposed as a suitable umbrella task realizing the exploration-search axis in the model. Finally, the pragmatic gap, defined as the difference between the tight machine categorization model and the flexible human categorization model is identified as a crucial multimedia analytics topic.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042476/","LOCKED","7042476","University of Amsterdam","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085525587","1","Jan Zahálka","37085525587","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Amsterdam","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267865600","2","Marcel Worring","37267865600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042476","12","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042476/","Multimedia (image/video/music) visualization","machine learning","","","","","","","Multimedia communication","Semantics","Visualization","Browsers","Streaming media","Data visualization","Feature extraction","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042476","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","97","3","Towards interactive, intelligent, and integrated multimedia analytics"
"The extraction of relevant and meaningful information from multivariate or high-dimensional data is a challenging problem. One reason for this is that the number of possible representations, which might contain relevant information, grows exponentially with the amount of data dimensions. Also, not all views from a possibly large view space, are potentially relevant to a given analysis task or user. Focus+Context or Semantic Zoom Interfaces can help to some extent to efficiently search for interesting views or data segments, yet they show scalability problems for very large data sets. Accordingly, users are confronted with the problem of identifying interesting views, yet the manual exploration of the entire view space becomes ineffective or even infeasible. While certain quality metrics have been proposed recently to identify potentially interesting views, these often are defined in a heuristic way and do not take into account the application or user context. We introduce a framework for a feedback-driven view exploration, inspired by relevance feedback approaches used in Information Retrieval. Our basic idea is that users iteratively express their notion of interestingness when presented with candidate views. From that expression, a model representing the user's preferences, is trained and used to recommend further interesting view candidates. A decision support system monitors the exploration process and assesses the relevance-driven search process for convergence and stability. We present an instantiation of our framework for exploration of Scatter Plot Spaces based on visual features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this implementation by a case study on two real-world datasets. We also discuss our framework in light of design alternatives and point out its usefulness for development of user- and context-dependent visual exploration systems.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042480/","LOCKED","7042480","Universität Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38551542600","1","Michael Behrisch","38551542600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Universität Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077498900","2","Fatih Korkmaz","37077498900","Universität Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085541736","3","Lin Shao","37085541736","Universität Konstanz, Germany","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282557600","4","Tobias Schreck","37282557600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","26","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042480","52","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042480/","View Space Exploration Framework","Interesting View Problem","Relevance Feedback","User Preference Model","","","","","Data visualization","Space exploration","Decision trees","Visualization","Vectors","Decision support systems","Data models","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042480","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","98","43","Feedback-driven interactive exploration of large multidimensional data supported by visual classifier"
"While many sports use statistics and video to analyze and improve game play, baseball has led the charge throughout its history. With the advent of new technologies that allow all players and the ball to be tracked across the entire field, it is now possible to bring this understanding to another level. From discrete positions across time, we present techniques to reconstruct entire baseball games and visually explore each play. This provides opportunities to not only derive new metrics for the game, but also allow us to investigate existing measures with targeted visualizations. In addition, our techniques allow users to filter on demand so specific situations can be analyzed both in general and according to those situations. We show that gameplay can be accurately reconstructed from the raw position data and discuss how visualization and statistical methods can combine to better inform baseball analyses.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042478/","LOCKED","7042478","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37867422200","1","Carlos Dietrich","37867422200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","NYU","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37647314800","2","David Koop","37647314800","NYU","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37549893300","3","Huy T.

"We present a method for evaluating visualizations using both tasks and exploration, and demonstrate this method in a study of spatiotemporal network designs for a visual analytics system. The method is well suited for studying visual analytics applications in which users perform both targeted data searches and analyses of broader patterns. In such applications, an effective visualization design is one that helps users complete tasks accurately and efficiently, and supports hypothesis generation during open-ended exploration. To evaluate both of these aims in a single study, we developed an approach called layered insight- and task-based evaluation (LITE) that interposes several prompts for observations about the data model between sequences of predefined search tasks. We demonstrate the evaluation method in a user study of four network visualizations for spatiotemporal data in a visual analytics application. Results include findings that might have been difficult to obtain in a single experiment using a different methodology. For example, with one dataset we studied, we found that on average participants were faster on search tasks using a force-directed layout than using our other designs; at the same time, participants found this design least helpful in understanding the data. Our contributions include a novel evaluation method that combines well-defined tasks with exploration and observation, an evaluation of network visualization designs for spatiotemporal visual analytics, and guidelines for using this evaluation method.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042482/","LOCKED","7042482","Brown University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38489539100","1","Steven R.

Such data types are commonly encountered in transportation, shipping, and logistics industries. Due to the scale and complexity of the data, it is essential to integrate techniques for data analysis, visualization, and exploration. We present new visual representations, Petal and Thread, to effectively present many-to-many network data including multi-attribute vectors. In addition, we deploy an information-theoretic model for anomaly detection across varying dimensions, displaying highlighted anomalies in a visually consistent manner, as well as supporting a managed process of exploration.

"Transport assessment plays a vital role in urban planning and traffic control, which are influenced by multi-faceted traffic factors involving road infrastructure and traffic flow. Conventional solutions can hardly meet the requirements and expectations of domain experts. In this paper we present a data-driven solution by leveraging a visual analysis system to evaluate the real traffic situations based on taxi trajectory data. A sketch-based visual interface is designed to support dynamic query and visual reasoning of traffic situations within multiple coordinated views. In particular, we propose a novel road-based query model for analysts to interactively conduct evaluation tasks. This model is supported by a bi-directional hash structure, TripHash, which enables real-time responses to the data queries over a huge amount of trajectory data. Case studies with a real taxi GPS trajectory dataset (> 30GB) show that our system performs well for on-demand transport assessment and reasoning.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042486/","LOCKED","7042486","State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085517058","1","Fei Wang","37085517058","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37291847800","2","Wei Chen","37291847800","State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085516214","3","Feiran Wu","37085516214","Kent State University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37277701200","4","Ye Zhao","37277701200","State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085505633","5","Han Hong","37085505633","State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085516108","6","Tianyu Gu","37085516108","State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085506836","7","Long Wang","37085506836","Zhejiang University of Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37429998500","8","Ronghua Liang","37429998500","State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085504609","9","Hujun Bao","37085504609","","","","","","23","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042486","112","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042486/","Road-based Query","Taxi Trajectory","Hash Index","Visual Analysis","","","","","Roads","Trajectory","Global Positioning System","Topology","Visualization","Indexes","","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042486","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","102","103","A visual reasoning approach for data-driven transport assessment on urban roads"
"Boundary changes exist ubiquitously in our daily life. From the Antarctic ozone hole to the land desertification, and from the territory of a country to the area within one-hour reach from a downtown location, boundaries change over time. With a large number of time-varying boundaries recorded, people often need to analyze the changes, detect their similarities or differences, and find out spatial and temporal patterns of the evolution for various applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive visual analytics system, BoundarySeer, to help users gain insight into the changes of boundaries. Our system consists of four major viewers: 1) a global viewer to show boundary groups based on their similarity and the distribution of boundary attributes such as smoothness and perimeter; 2) a region viewer to display the regions encircled by the boundaries and how they are affected by boundary changes; 3) a trend viewer to reveal the temporal patterns in the boundary evolution and potential spatio-temporal correlations; 4) a directional change viewer to encode movements of boundary segments in different directions. Quantitative analyses of boundaries (e.g., similarity measurement and adaptive clustering) and intuitive visualizations (e.g., density map and ThemeRiver) are integrated into these viewers, which enable users to explore boundary changes from different aspects and at different scales. Case studies with two real-world datasets have been carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042490/","LOCKED","7042490","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085419783","1","Wenchao Wu","37085419783","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085403277","2","Yixian Zheng","37085403277","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","3","Huamin Qu","37272637300","State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085418543","4","Wei Chen","37085418543","Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms, Vienna University of Technology and VRVis Research Center, Austria","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284271200","5","Eduard Gröller","37284271200","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085415274","6","Lionel M.

"Economic development based on industrialization, intensive agriculture expansion and population growth places greater pressure on water resources through increased water abstraction and water quality degradation [40], River pollution is now a visible issue, with emblematic ecological disasters following industrial accidents such as the pollution of the Rhine river in 1986 [31]. River water quality is a pivotal public health and environmental issue that has prompted governments to plan initiatives for preserving or restoring aquatic ecosystems and water resources [56], Water managers require operational tools to help interpret the complex range of information available on river water quality functioning. Tools based on statistical approaches often fail to resolve some tasks due to the sparse nature of the data. Here we describe HydroQual, a tool to facilitate visual analysis of river water quality. This tool combines spatiotemporal data mining and visualization techniques to perform tasks defined by water experts. We illustrate the approach with a case study that illustrates how the tool helps experts analyze water quality.

"Semantic interaction offers an intuitive communication mechanism between human users and complex statistical models. By shielding the users from manipulating model parameters, they focus instead on directly manipulating the spatialization, thus remaining in their cognitive zone. However, this technique is not inherently scalable past hundreds of text documents. To remedy this, we present the concept of multi-model semantic interaction, where semantic interactions can be used to steer multiple models at multiple levels of data scale, enabling users to tackle larger data problems. We also present an updated visualization pipeline model for generalized multi-model semantic interaction. To demonstrate multi-model semantic interaction, we introduce StarSPIRE, a visual text analytics prototype that transforms user interactions on documents into both small-scale display layout updates as well as large-scale relevancy-based document selection.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042492/","LOCKED","7042492","Virginia Tech.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37071531400","1","Lauren Bradel","37071531400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Virginia Tech.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37419565900","2","Chris North","37419565900","Virginia Tech.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38241765600","3","Leanna House","38241765600","Virginia Tech.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38236156800","4","Scotland Leman","38236156800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","25","0","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042492","172","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042492/","Visual analytics","Semantic Interaction","Sensemaking","Text Analytics","","","","","Semantics","Data models","Layout","Data visualization","Pipelines","Analytical models","Visualization","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042492","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","105","163","Multi-model semantic interaction for text analytics"
"We present a visual analytics approach to developing a full picture of relevant topics discussed in multiple sources such as news, blogs, or micro-blogs. The full picture consists of a number of common topics among multiple sources as well as distinctive topics. The key idea behind our approach is to jointly match the topics extracted from each source together in order to interactively and effectively analyze common and distinctive topics. We start by modeling each textual corpus as a topic graph. These graphs are then matched together with a consistent graph matching method. Next, we develop an LOD-based visualization for better understanding and analysis of the matched graph. The major feature of this visualization is that it combines a radially stacked tree visualization with a density-based graph visualization to facilitate the examination of the matched topic graph from multiple perspectives. To compensate for the deficiency of the graph matching algorithm and meet different users' needs, we allow users to interactively modify the graph matching result. We have applied our approach to various data including news, tweets, and blog data. Qualitative evaluation and a real-world case study with domain experts demonstrate the promise of our approach, especially in support of analyzing a topic-graph-based full picture at different levels of detail.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042494/","LOCKED","7042494","Microsoft Research Asia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406039100","1","Shixia Liu","37406039100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Tsinghua University and Microsoft Research Asia","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085460249","2","Xiting Wang","37085460249","Dept. of Comp.

"Hundreds of millions of people leave digital footprints on social media (e.g., Twitter and Facebook). Such data not only disclose a person's demographics and opinions, but also reveal one's emotional style. Emotional style captures a person's patterns of emotions over time, including his overall emotional volatility and resilience. Understanding one's emotional style can provide great benefits for both individuals and businesses alike, including the support of self-reflection and delivery of individualized customer care. We present PEARL, a timeline-based visual analytic tool that allows users to interactively discover and examine a person's emotional style derived from this person's social media text. Compared to other visual text analytic systems, our work offers three unique contributions. First, it supports multi-dimensional emotion analysis from social media text to automatically detect a person's expressed emotions at different time points and summarize those emotions to reveal the person's emotional style. Second, it effectively visualizes complex, multi-dimensional emotion analysis results to create a visual emotional profile of an individual, which helps users browse and interpret one's emotional style. Third, it supports rich visual interactions that allow users to interactively explore and validate emotion analysis results. We have evaluated our work extensively through a series of studies. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool both in emotion analysis from social media and in support of interactive visualization of the emotion analysis results.","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042496/","LOCKED","7042496","University of Toronto","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38024987300","1","Jian Zhao","38024987300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IBM Research Almadén","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37075500200","2","Liang Gou","37075500200","IBM Research Almadén","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38276538300","3","Fei Wang","38276538300","IBM Research Almadén","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399569300","4","Michelle Zhou","37399569300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","24","4","25-31 Oct. 2014","Paris, France","Conferences","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042496","212","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7042496/","Personal emotion analytics","affective and mood modeling","social media text","Twitter","information visualization","","","","Mood","Visualization","Media","Engines","Analytical models","Resilience","Computational modeling","7042473","978-1-4799-6227-3","Electronic ISBN","New-2005","978-1-4799-6227-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7042496","25-31 Oct. 2014","7027279","2014 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","2014","IEEE","107","203","PEARL: An interactive visual analytic tool for understanding personal emotion style derived from social media"
