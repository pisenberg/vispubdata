conference_external,2014,VisMOOC: Visualizing video clickstream data from massive open online courses,10.1109/VAST.2014.7042528,https://doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2014.7042528,277,278,Conferences,"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are becoming increasingly popular and have attracted much research attention. Analyzing clickstreams on MOOC videos poses a special analytical challenge but provides a good opportunity for understanding how students interact with course videos, which in turn can help instructors and educational analysts gain insights into online learning behavior. In this poster, we develop a visual analytical system, VisMOOC, to help instructors analyze the clickstream data. VisMOOC consists of three main views: the List View to list all course videos for analysts to select the video they are interested in; the Content-based View to show how each type of click actions change along the video timeline, which enables the most viewed sections to be observed and the most interesting patterns to be discovered; The Dashboard View shows the information of the clickstream data in different aspects, including the course information, the geographic distribution, the video temporal information, the video popularity, and the animation. Furthermore, case studies made by the instructors demonstrate the usefulness of VisMOOC and helped them gaining deep insights into learning behavior for MOOCs.",,Conglei Shi;Siwei Fu;Qing Chen;Huamin Qu,"CSE Department, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology;CSE Department, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology;CSE Department, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology;CSE Department, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology",,",,,,,,,",,24,,

They are data that were intended to be recorded, but for some reason were not. Missing values are common in data analysis and occur in almost any domain, causing problems such as biased results and reduced statistical rigour. Visual analytics has great potential to provide invaluable support for the investigation of missing data. This poster aims to highlight the importance of analysing missing data and the challenges involved, as well as to emphasize the lack of visualization support in the area and through this encourage visualization scientists to discuss and address this highly relevant issue.",,Sara Johansson Fernstad;Robert C Glen,University of Cambridge;University of Cambridge,,"Missing data,visualization,exploratory analysis,,,,,",,10,,

In many space-time visualizations, additional variables must be mapped into other visual attributes such as color or size. Given that substantive analyses of trajectory data will likely be concerned with variables beyond space and time, we propose a method that allows trajectory positions to be determined by an arbitrary number of variables in a multi-dimensional space-time dataset. Our method is based on Star Coordinates [5], a prior technique for interactively positioning multi-dimensional data. Our technique is catered specifically to multi-dimensional space-time trajectory data. The technique is demonstrated using a large multidimensional space-time dataset related to touring musicians.",,Paul Murray;Angus Forbes,University of Illinois at Chicago;University of Illinois at Chicago,,",,,,,,,",,7,,

In order to gather and combine the necessary tissue information, multi-modal imaging is used to derive a number of parameters indicative of tissue properties. The exploration and analysis of relationships between parameters and, especially, of differences among distinct intra-tumor regions is particularly interesting for clinical researchers to individualize tumor treatment. However, due to high data dimensionality and complexity, the current clinical workflow is time demanding and does not provide the necessary intra-tumor insight. We implemented a new application for the exploration of the relationships between parameters and heterogeneity within tumors. In our approach, we employ a well-known dimensionality reduction technique [5] to map the high-dimensional space of tissue properties into a 2D information space that can be interactively explored with integrated information visualization techniques. We conducted several usage scenarios with real-patient data, of which we present a case of advanced cervical cancer.

In recent years, online text communication (e.g., chat, forums, email) has been widely used in cross-cultural collaborations, and emoticons are often viewed as socio-emotional cues in this type of communication. Therefore, it is important to know how emoticons work in online text communication. One way to investigate this topic is to leverage theories in sociolinguistics to find potential mappings between emoticon use and face-to-face language use. In the present work, we propose a visual analytics tool to explore emoticon use among different groups over time and show how visual analytics can elicit storytelling in studying linguistic alignment of emoticons in a chat log dataset from a four-year scientific collaboration between France and the United States.",,Nan-Chen Chen;Laurie Beth Feldman;Judith F.

Meanings of some places could be refined using the credit card transaction data. By representing the place meanings as points on a 2D plane, we built an abstract semantic space and transformed the original trajectories to trajectories in the semantic space. Spatio-temporal aggregation of the transformed trajectories into flows between the semantic places and subsequent clustering of time intervals by the similarity of the flow situations allowed us to reveal the routine movement behaviors. To detect anomalies, we (a) investigated the visits to the places with unknown meanings, and (b) looked for unusual presence times or visit durations at different semantic places.

Although visualization history has the potential to communicate such information, the common representations are often limited to sequential lists of past work. Such representations do not make it easy to understand the analytic coverage of the dimension space (i.e. which dimensions have been investigated and which have not). This makes it difficult for an analyst to plan their next steps, particularly when the number of dimensions is large. In this paper, we propose representing the prior analysis from a dimension coverage perspective. Dimension view provides a unique perspective that can facilitate exploratory analysis by enabling analysts to easily identify what dimensions have been examined and in what combinations. We hypothesize that addition of this view to common representations of visualization history will reduce cognitive and interaction costs by helping the analyst to discover data subsets to explore. We studied the effects of this view on a distributed collaborative visualization process.

Roughly speaking, network models aim at gaining a better understanding of how actors influence the overall network behaviour through their individual actions. However, considering the extended literature surrounding the subject, one is entitled to think that moving beyond the state-of-the-art in network modeling requires the ability to compare models, or consider slight variations of a model. This requires having a common language describing all considered models, allowing to objectively compare them and unfold their inherent properties and complexity. This also assumes users can easily run models, steer them and interactively evaluate their performance and behaviour. The approach we describe aims at providing a framework turning network propagation modeling into rule-based modeling (aka graph rewriting). That is, models are described as a set of algorithmic transformation rules acting locally. Our approach has partially been validated by providing such a description of a well-known model relying on probabilistic rules, where nodes trigger actions depending on their neighbor's influences. The results so obtained confirm rule-based modeling as a promising avenue. The use of a visual analytics framework to conduct such tasks is vital and motivated us to further develop and adapt a general purpose visual analytics system for graph rewriting to the particular case of network propagation.",,Jason Vallet;Bruno Pinaud;Guy Melançon,"University of Bordeaux, France;University of Bordeaux, France;University of Bordeaux, France",,"I.2.4 [Artificial Intelligence]: Knowledge Representation — Formalisms and Methods,F.1.2 [Computation by Abstract Devices]: Modes of Computation,,,,,,",,2,,

But all suffer from a common problem-visualizing the data and variable points separately which is hard for people to catch the relations in data and variables together. We describe a method that allows data and variables balanced layouts. We achieve it by combining two distance matrices typically used in isolation - the distance matrix encoding the similarities of the variables and the distance matrix encoding the similarity of the data points. The remaining two submatrices are obtained by creating a fused distance matrix - one that measures the distance of data points with respect to the variables or vice versa. We then use MDS to simultaneously optimize the placement of data points and variable points, producing a display that allows users to appreciate all three types of relationships in a single display: (1) the patterns of the collection of data items, (2) the patterns of the collection of variables, and (3) the relationships of data items with the variables and vice versa.",,Shenghui Cheng;Bing Wang;Zhiyuan Zhang;Klaus Mueller,"Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, Songdo, NY, Korea;Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, Songdo, NY, Korea;Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, Songdo, NY, Korea;Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, Songdo, NY, Korea",,",,,,,,,",,0,,

Most automated approaches rely on segmenting the individual spots, which becomes unreliable when the image contains artifacts, noise, or confounding objects. Therefore, practitioners often resort to tedious and time-consuming manual counting and measurements. As an alternative, we propose a visual analytics approach to this problem. It is based on Total Variation Flow, a partial differential equation that changes the intensities of image regions at a rate inverse to their scale. From this, we derive novel quantitative per-pixel measures of scale and density, and we show how the results can be combined with tools for visualization and selection to achieve a fast summary of median size and spot density in an image. Given a set of images, our framework places them on a 2D map that makes it easy to quickly compare them with respect to spot sizes and density.

At each of these levels, there is a wealth of information that can inform inquiry - from statistical models, to metadata, to the researcher's own knowledge and expertise. Joining all this information together can be a challenge, and there are issues of scale to be combatted along the way. In this paper, we describe an approach to text analysis that addresses these challenges of scale and multiple information sources, using probabilistic topic models to structure exploration through multiple levels of inquiry in a way that fosters serendipitous discovery. In implementing this approach into a tool called Serendip, we incorporate topic model data and metadata into a highly reorderable matrix to expose corpus level trends; extend encodings of tagged text to illustrate probabilistic information at a passage level; and introduce a technique for visualizing individual word rankings, along with interaction techniques and new statistical methods to create links between different levels and information types.

Such data not only disclose a person's demographics and opinions, but also reveal one's emotional style. Emotional style captures a person's patterns of emotions over time, including his overall emotional volatility and resilience. Understanding one's emotional style can provide great benefits for both individuals and businesses alike, including the support of self-reflection and delivery of individualized customer care. We present PEARL, a timeline-based visual analytic tool that allows users to interactively discover and examine a person's emotional style derived from this person's social media text. Compared to other visual text analytic systems, our work offers three unique contributions. First, it supports multi-dimensional emotion analysis from social media text to automatically detect a person's expressed emotions at different time points and summarize those emotions to reveal the person's emotional style. Second, it effectively visualizes complex, multi-dimensional emotion analysis results to create a visual emotional profile of an individual, which helps users browse and interpret one's emotional style. Third, it supports rich visual interactions that allow users to interactively explore and validate emotion analysis results. We have evaluated our work extensively through a series of studies.

The full picture consists of a number of common topics among multiple sources as well as distinctive topics. The key idea behind our approach is to jointly match the topics extracted from each source together in order to interactively and effectively analyze common and distinctive topics. We start by modeling each textual corpus as a topic graph. These graphs are then matched together with a consistent graph matching method. Next, we develop an LOD-based visualization for better understanding and analysis of the matched graph. The major feature of this visualization is that it combines a radially stacked tree visualization with a density-based graph visualization to facilitate the examination of the matched topic graph from multiple perspectives. To compensate for the deficiency of the graph matching algorithm and meet different users' needs, we allow users to interactively modify the graph matching result.

One reason for this is that the number of possible representations, which might contain relevant information, grows exponentially with the amount of data dimensions. Also, not all views from a possibly large view space, are potentially relevant to a given analysis task or user. Focus+Context or Semantic Zoom Interfaces can help to some extent to efficiently search for interesting views or data segments, yet they show scalability problems for very large data sets. Accordingly, users are confronted with the problem of identifying interesting views, yet the manual exploration of the entire view space becomes ineffective or even infeasible. While certain quality metrics have been proposed recently to identify potentially interesting views, these often are defined in a heuristic way and do not take into account the application or user context. We introduce a framework for a feedback-driven view exploration, inspired by relevance feedback approaches used in Information Retrieval. Our basic idea is that users iteratively express their notion of interestingness when presented with candidate views. From that expression, a model representing the user's preferences, is trained and used to recommend further interesting view candidates. A decision support system monitors the exploration process and assesses the relevance-driven search process for convergence and stability. We present an instantiation of our framework for exploration of Scatter Plot Spaces based on visual features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this implementation by a case study on two real-world datasets.

In this paper we focus on the reconstruction of meshes from point clouds, which are sets of points in 3D. Several algorithms that tackle this task already exist, but they have different benefits and drawbacks, which leads to a large number of possible reconstruction results (i.e., meshes). The evaluation of those techniques requires extensive comparisons between different meshes which is up to now done by either placing images of rendered meshes side-by-side, or by encoding differences by heat maps. A major drawback of both approaches is that they do not scale well with the number of meshes. This paper introduces a new comparative visual analysis technique for 3D meshes which enables the simultaneous comparison of several meshes and allows for the interactive exploration of their differences. Our approach gives an overview of the differences of the input meshes in a 2D view.

A mutation chain is represented by a directed acyclic graph, where amino acids are connected by their mutation dependencies. As each amino acid may mutate individually, many mutation graphs exist. To determine important impacts of mutations, experts need to analyze and compare common patterns in these mutations graphs. Experts, however, lack suitable tools for this purpose.

The definition of a BTV requires insight into tumour characteristics going beyond conventionally defined radiological abnormalities and anatomical features. Molecular and biochemical imaging techniques, like positron emission tomography, the use of Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging contrast agents or MR Spectroscopy deliver this information and support BTV delineation. MR Spectroscopy Imaging (MRSI) is the only non-invasive technique in this list. Studies with MRSI have shown that voxels with certain metabolic signatures are more susceptible to predict the site of relapse. Nevertheless, the discovery of complex relationships between a high number of different metabolites, anatomical, molecular and functional features is an ongoing topic of research - still lacking appropriate tools supporting a smooth workflow by providing data integration and fusion of MRSI data with other imaging modalities. We present a solution bridging this gap which gives fast and flexible access to all data at once. By integrating a customized visualization of the multi-modal and multi-variate image data with a highly flexible visual analytics (VA) framework, it is for the first time possible to interactively fuse, visualize and explore user defined metabolite relations derived from MRSI in combination with markers delivered by other imaging modalities. Real-world medical cases demonstrate the utility of our solution. By making MRSI data available both in a VA tool and in a multi-modal visualization renderer we can combine insights from each side to arrive at a superior BTV delineation. We also report feedback from domain experts indicating significant positive impact in how this work can improve the understanding of MRSI data and its integration into radiotherapy planning.",,Miguel Nunes;Benjamin Rowland;Matthias Schlachter;Soléakhéna Ken;Kresimir Matkovic;Anne Laprie;Katja Bühler,"VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria;Institut Claudius Regaud, Toulouse, France;VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria;Institut Claudius Regaud, Toulouse, France;VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria;Institut Claudius Regaud, Toulouse, France;VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria",,"MR spectroscopy,cancer,brain,visualization,multi-modality data,radiotherapy planning,medical decision support systems,",,5,,

A group named the Protectors of Kronos (POK) was the prime suspect in the disappearance. Three mini-challenges and a grand challenge were offered. Mini-challenge 1 included multiple types of text data for participants to provide a timeline of key events and characterize the POK, mini-challenge 2 focused on individuals' movement and financial data for participants to provide patterns of daily life, and mini-challenge 3 featured real-time streaming social media and emergency service data for participants to provide hostage and kidnapper information. The grand challenge asked the participants to integrate results and generate a synopsis of events. The VAST Challenge received 73 submissions from 13 countries.",,Mark Whiting;Kristin Cook;Georges Grinstein;Kristen Liggett;Michael Cooper;John Fallon;Marc Morin,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory;Pacific Northwest National Laboratory;University of Massachusetts Lowell;Air Force Research Laboratory;Pacific Northwest National Laboratory;University of Massachusetts Lowell;Battelle,,"Visual analytics,human information interaction,sense making,evaluation,metrics,contest,,",,3,,
VAST-conf,2014,A system for visual analysis of radio signal data,10.1109/VAST.2014.7042479,https://doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2014.7042479,33,42,Conferences,"Analysis of radio transmissions is vital for military defense as it provides valuable information about enemy communication and infrastructure. One challenge to the data analysis task is that there are far too many signals for analysts to go through by hand. Even typical signal meta data (such as frequency band, duration, and geographic location) can be overwhelming. In this paper, we present a system for exploring and analyzing such radio signal meta-data. Our system incorporates several visual representations for signal data, designed for readability and ease of comparison, as well as novel algorithms for extracting and classifying consistent signal patterns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system using data collected from real missions with an airborne sensor platform.",,Tarik Crnovrsanin;Chris Muelder;Kwan-Liu Ma,"VIDi, U. C., Davis;VIDi, U.
