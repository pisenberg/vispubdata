The major challenge in this context is the combinatorial explosion of the number of set intersections if the number of sets exceeds a trivial threshold. In this paper we introduce UpSet, a novel visualization technique for the quantitative analysis of sets, their intersections, and aggregates of intersections. UpSet is focused on creating task-driven aggregates, communicating the size and properties of aggregates and intersections, and a duality between the visualization of the elements in a dataset and their set membership. UpSet visualizes set intersections in a matrix layout and introduces aggregates based on groupings and queries. The matrix layout enables the effective representation of associated data, such as the number of elements in the aggregates and intersections, as well as additional summary statistics derived from subset or element attributes. Sorting according to various measures enables a task-driven analysis of relevant intersections and aggregates. The elements represented in the sets and their associated attributes are visualized in a separate view. Queries based on containment in specific intersections, aggregates or driven by attribute filters are propagated between both views. We also introduce several advanced visual encodings and interaction methods to overcome the problems of varying scales and to address scalability. UpSet is web-based and open source. We demonstrate its general utility in multiple use cases from various domains.","article_number":"6876017","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6876017","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876017/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876017/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"1983","end_page":"1992","citing_paper_count":1165,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":17902,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Visualization","Power generation","Sorting","Information analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Sets","set visualization","sets intersections","set attributes","set relationships","multidimensional data"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346458","title":"Fixed-Rate Compressed Floating-Point Arrays","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":2,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Center for Applied Scientific Computing, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37269320000","id":37269320000,"full_name":"Peter Lindstrom","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Center for Applied Scientific Computing, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Current compression schemes for floating-point data commonly take fixed-precision values and compress them to a variable-length bit stream, complicating memory management and random access. We present a fixed-rate, near-lossless compression scheme that maps small blocks of 4d values in d dimensions to a fixed, user-specified number of bits per block, thereby allowing read and write random access to compressed floating-point data at block granularity. Our approach is inspired by fixed-rate texture compression methods widely adopted in graphics hardware, but has been tailored to the high dynamic range and precision demands of scientific applications. Our compressor is based on a new, lifted, orthogonal block transform and embedded coding, allowing each per-block bit stream to be truncated at any point if desired, thus facilitating bit rate selection using a single compression scheme. To avoid compression or decompression upon every data access, we employ a software write-back cache of uncompressed blocks. Our compressor has been designed with computational simplicity and speed in mind to allow for the possibility of a hardware implementation, and uses only a small number of fixed-point arithmetic operations per compressed value. We demonstrate the viability and benefits of lossy compression in several applications, including visualization, quantitative data analysis, and numerical simulation.","article_number":"6876024","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6876024","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876024/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876024/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2674","end_page":"2683","citing_paper_count":317,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2932,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Floating-point arithmetic","Image coding","Encoding","Bandwidth allocation","Data visualization","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data compression","floating-point arrays","orthogonal block transform","embedded coding"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346481","title":"Knowledge Generation Model for Visual Analytics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":3,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085566394","id":37085566394,"full_name":"Dominik Sacha","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz"]}},{"affiliation":"Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37592880100","id":37592880100,"full_name":"Andreas Stoffel","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz"]}},{"affiliation":"Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233603600","id":38233603600,"full_name":"Florian Stoffel","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz"]}},{"affiliation":"Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085677185","id":37085677185,"full_name":"Bum Chul Kwon","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz"]}},{"affiliation":"Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283380700","id":37283380700,"full_name":"Geoffrey Ellis","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz"]}},{"affiliation":"Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283138700","id":37283138700,"full_name":"Daniel A.

Humans play a central role in generating knowledge from the snippets of evidence emerging from visual data analysis. Although prior research provides frameworks that generalize this process, their scope is often narrowly focused so they do not encompass different perspectives at different levels. This paper proposes a knowledge generation model for visual analytics that ties together these diverse frameworks, yet retains previously developed models (e.g., KDD process) to describe individual segments of the overall visual analytic processes. To test its utility, a real world visual analytics system is compared against the model, demonstrating that the knowledge generation process model provides a useful guideline when developing and evaluating such systems. The model is used to effectively compare different data analysis systems. Furthermore, the model provides a common language and description of visual analytic processes, which can be used for communication between researchers.

However, the effects of interactive latency on the process and outcomes of exploratory visual analysis have not been systematically studied. We present an experiment measuring user behavior and knowledge discovery with interactive visualizations under varying latency conditions. We observe that an additional delay of 500ms incurs significant costs, decreasing user activity and data set coverage. Analyzing verbal data from think-aloud protocols, we find that increased latency reduces the rate at which users make observations, draw generalizations and generate hypotheses. Moreover, we note interaction effects in which initial exposure to higher latencies leads to subsequently reduced performance in a low-latency setting. Overall, increased latency causes users to shift exploration strategy, in turn affecting performance. We discuss how these results can inform the design of interactive analysis tools.","article_number":"6876022","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6876022","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876022/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876022/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2122","end_page":"2131","citing_paper_count":164,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1740,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Visual analytics","Data visualization","Visualization","Interactive services","Image color analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Interaction","latency","exploratory analysis","interactive visualization","scalability","user performance","verbal analysis"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346922","title":"#FluxFlow: Visual Analysis of Anomalous Information Spreading on Social Media","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":5,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Toronto","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38024987300","id":38024987300,"full_name":"Jian Zhao","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Toronto"]}},{"affiliation":"MIT","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37604309600","id":37604309600,"full_name":"Nan Cao","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["MIT"]}},{"affiliation":"MIT","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37548307800","id":37548307800,"full_name":"Zhen Wen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["MIT"]}},{"affiliation":"IBM J.

Everyday, millions of messages are created, commented, and shared by people on social media websites, such as Twitter and Facebook. This provides valuable data for researchers and practitioners in many application domains, such as marketing, to inform decision-making. Distilling valuable social signals from the huge crowd's messages, however, is challenging, due to the heterogeneous and dynamic crowd behaviors. The challenge is rooted in data analysts' capability of discerning the anomalous information behaviors, such as the spreading of rumors or misinformation, from the rest that are more conventional patterns, such as popular topics and newsworthy events, in a timely fashion. FluxFlow incorporates advanced machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies, and offers a set of novel visualization designs for presenting the detected threads for deeper analysis. We evaluated FluxFlow with real datasets containing the Twitter feeds captured during significant events such as Hurricane Sandy. Through quantitative measurements of the algorithmic performance and qualitative interviews with domain experts, the results show that the back-end anomaly detection model is effective in identifying anomalous retweeting threads, and its front-end interactive visualizations are intuitive and useful for analysts to discover insights in data and comprehend the underlying analytical model.","article_number":"6876013","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6876013","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876013/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876013/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"1773","end_page":"1782","citing_paper_count":133,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":3881,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Message systems","Media","Twitter","Feature extraction","Data visualization","Social network services","Instruction sets","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Retweeting threads","anomaly detection","social media","visual analytics","machine learning","information visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346574","title":"Progressive Visual Analytics: User-Driven Visual Exploration of In-Progress Analytics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":6,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Interactive Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490190000","id":38490190000,"full_name":"Charles D.

This paper presents an alternative workflow, progressive visual analytics, which enables an analyst to inspect partial results of an algorithm as they become available and interact with the algorithm to prioritize subspaces of interest. Progressive visual analytics depends on adapting analytical algorithms to produce meaningful partial results and enable analyst intervention without sacrificing computational speed. The paradigm also depends on adapting information visualization techniques to incorporate the constantly refining results without overwhelming analysts and provide interactions to support an analyst directing the analytic.

However, for data that is high-dimensional, a critical step in predictive modeling is determining which features should be included in the models. Feature selection algorithms are often used to remove non-informative features from models. However, there are many different classes of feature selection algorithms. Deciding which one to use is problematic as the algorithmic output is often not amenable to user interpretation. This limits the ability for users to utilize their domain expertise during the modeling process. To improve on this limitation, we developed INFUSE, a novel visual analytics system designed to help analysts understand how predictive features are being ranked across feature selection algorithms, cross-validation folds, and classifiers.

The results of this experiment contribute to our understanding of information visualization by establishing that: (1) for all tested visualizations, the precision of correlation judgment could be modeled by Weber's law, (2) correlation judgment precision showed striking variation between negatively and positively correlated data, and (3) Weber models provide a concise means to quantify, compare, and rank the perceptual precision afforded by a visualization.","article_number":"6875978","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875978","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875978/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875978/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"1943","end_page":"1952","citing_paper_count":112,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1862,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Design methodology","Data visualization","Crowdsourcing","Image color analysis","Data models","Testing"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Perception","Visualization","Evaluation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346984","title":"A Principled Way of Assessing Visualization Literacy","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":13,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Inria, Telecom ParisTech, EnsadLab","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085379303","id":37085379303,"full_name":"Jeremy Boy","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Inria, Telecom ParisTech, EnsadLab"]}},{"affiliation":"University of British Columbia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37871313100","id":37871313100,"full_name":"Ronald A.

In response to a growing interest in simulation ensembles, the visualization community has developed a suite of methods for allowing users to observe and understand the properties of these ensembles in an efficient and effective manner. An important aspect of visualizing simulations is the analysis of derived features, often represented as points, surfaces, or curves. In this paper, we present a novel, nonparametric method for summarizing ensembles of 2D and 3D curves. We propose an extension of a method from descriptive statistics, data depth, to curves. We also demonstrate a set of rendering and visualization strategies for showing rank statistics of an ensemble of curves, which is a generalization of traditional whisker plots or boxplots to multidimensional curves.

This approach involves a new method for origin-destination flow density estimation and a new method for flow map generalization, which together can remove spurious data variance, normalize flows with control population, and detect high-level patterns that are not discernable with existing approaches. The approach achieves three main objectives in addressing the challenges for analyzing and mapping massive flow data. First, it removes the effect of size differences among spatial units via kernel-based density estimation, which produces a measurement of flow volume between each pair of origin and destination. Second, it extracts major flow patterns in massive flow data through a new flow sampling method, which filters out duplicate information in the smoothed flows. Third, it enables effective flow mapping and allows intuitive perception of flow patterns among origins and destinations without bundling or altering flow paths. The approach can work with both point-based flow data (such as taxi trips with GPS locations) and area-based flow data (such as county-to-county migration). Moreover, the approach can be used to detect and compare flow patterns at different scales or in relatively sparse flow datasets, such as migration for each age group. We evaluate and demonstrate the new approach with case studies of U.S. migration data and experiments with synthetic data.","article_number":"6875983","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875983","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875983/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875983/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2043","end_page":"2052","citing_paper_count":94,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2550,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Flow graphs","Statistics","Smoothing methods","Bandwidth allocation","Feature extraction","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["flow mapping","kernel smoothing","generalization","multi-resolution mapping","graph drawing","spatial data mining"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346419","title":"The Persuasive Power of Data Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":16,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085415876","id":37085415876,"full_name":"Anshul Vikram Pandey","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University"]}},{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085402668","id":37085402668,"full_name":"Anjali Manivannan","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University"]}},{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37829353000","id":37829353000,"full_name":"Oded Nov","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University"]}},{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085411015","id":37085411015,"full_name":"Margaret Satterthwaite","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University"]}},{"affiliation":"New York University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38267713800","id":38267713800,"full_name":"Enrico Bertini","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["New York University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Data visualization has been used extensively to inform users.

However, following evolving topics in the context of topic trees remains difficult for users. To address this issue, we present an interactive visual text analysis approach to allow users to progressively explore and analyze the complex evolutionary patterns of hierarchical topics. The key idea behind our approach is to exploit a tree cut to approximate each tree and allow users to interactively modify the tree cuts based on their interests. In particular, we propose an incremental evolutionary tree cut algorithm with the goal of balancing 1) the fitness of each tree cut and the smoothness between adjacent tree cuts; 2) the historical and new information related to user interests. A time-based visualization is designed to illustrate the evolving topics over time. To preserve the mental map, we develop a stable layout algorithm. As a result, our approach can quickly guide users to progressively gain profound insights into evolving hierarchical topics. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method on Amazon's Mechanical Turk and real-world news data.

Given a set of street-level images and (location, city-attribute-value) pairs of measurements, we first identify visual elements in the images that are discriminative of the attribute. We then train a predictor by learning a set of weights over these elements using non-linear Support Vector Regression. To perform these operations efficiently, we implement a scalable distributed processing framework that speeds up the main computational bottleneck (extracting visual elements) by an order of magnitude. This speedup allows us to investigate a variety of city attributes across 6 different American cities. We find that indeed there is a predictive relationship between visual elements and a number of city attributes including violent crime rates, theft rates, housing prices, population density, tree presence, graffiti presence, and the perception of danger. We also test human performance for predicting theft based on street-level images and show that our predictor outperforms this baseline with 33% higher accuracy on average. Finally, we present three prototype applications that use our system to (1) define the visual boundary of city neighborhoods, (2) generate walking directions that avoid or seek out exposure to city attributes, and (3) validate user-specified visual elements for prediction.","article_number":"6875954","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875954","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875954/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875954/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2624","end_page":"2633","citing_paper_count":85,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1930,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Urban areas","Forensics","Support vector machines","Feature extraction","Predictive models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Data mining","big data","computational geography","visual processing"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346441","title":"Multivariate Network Exploration and Presentation: From Detail to Overview via Selections and Aggregations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":20,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"SynerScope BV, Eindhoven, The Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38233594700","id":38233594700,"full_name":"Stef van den Elzen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SynerScope BV, Eindhoven, The Netherlands","Department of Mathematic and Computer Science, Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Mathematic and Computer Science, Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267249200","id":37267249200,"full_name":"Jarke J. van Wijk","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Mathematic and Computer Science, Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Network data is ubiquitous; e-mail traffic between persons, telecommunication, transport and financial networks are some examples.

However, due to their increasing complexity, designing effective methods to visualize and explore PTS is highly challenging. Most existing techniques employ network visualization methods and focus on showing the network topology across stops while ignoring various mobility-related factors such as riding time, transfer time, waiting time, and round-the-clock patterns. This work aims to visualize and explore passenger mobility in a PTS with a family of analytical tasks based on inputs from transportation researchers. After exploring different design alternatives, we come up with an integrated solution with three visualization modules: isochrone map view for geographical information, isotime flow map view for effective temporal information comparison and manipulation, and OD-pair journey view for detailed visual analysis of mobility factors along routes between specific origin-destination pairs. The isotime flow map linearizes a flow map into a parallel isoline representation, maximizing the visualization of mobility information along the horizontal time axis while presenting clear and smooth pathways from origin to destinations. Moreover, we devise several interactive visual query methods for users to easily explore the dynamics of PTS mobility over space and time. Lastly, we also construct a PTS mobility model from millions of real passenger trajectories, and evaluate our visualization techniques with assorted case studies with the transportation researchers.","article_number":"6876029","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6876029","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876029/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876029/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"1833","end_page":"1842","citing_paper_count":83,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":3236,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Transportation","Data visualization","Urban areas","Visual analytics","Schedules","Radiofrequency identification","Urban areas"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Mobility","public transportation","visual analytics"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346919","title":"EvoRiver: Visual Analysis of Topic Coopetition on Social Media","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":22,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085399384","id":37085399384,"full_name":"Guodao Sun","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhejiang University of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","id":37407308300,"full_name":"Yingcai Wu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406039100","id":37406039100,"full_name":"Shixia Liu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research"]}},{"affiliation":"Nanyang Technological University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077240400","id":37077240400,"full_name":"Tai-Quan Peng","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Nanyang Technological University"]}},{"affiliation":"City University of Hong Kong","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37405779600","id":37405779600,"full_name":"Jonathan J.

We answer these intricate questions by proposing a visual analytics system that facilitates the in-depth analysis of topic coopetition on social media. We model the complex interactions among topics as a combination of carry-over, coopetition recruitment, and coopetition distraction effects.

To deal with such uncertainties, we first design a local animation, showing the vehicle movements only in the vicinity of cells. Besides, we ignore the micro-behaviors of individual vehicles, and focus on the macro-traffic patterns. We apply existing trajectory aggregation techniques to the dataset, studying cell status pattern and inter-cell flow pattern. Beyond that, we propose to study the correlation between these two patterns with dynamic graph visualization techniques.

However, in current visual analytics systems, the computer has limited means of knowing about its users and their analysis processes. While existing research has shown that a user's interactions with a system reflect a large amount of the user's reasoning process, there has been limited advancement in developing automated, real-time techniques that mine interactions to learn about the user. In this paper, we demonstrate that we can accurately predict a user's task performance and infer some user personality traits by using machine learning techniques to analyze interaction data. Specifically, we conduct an experiment in which participants perform a visual search task, and apply well-known machine learning algorithms to three encodings of the users' interaction data. We achieve, depending on algorithm and encoding, between 62% and 83% accuracy at predicting whether each user will be fast or slow at completing the task. Beyond predicting performance, we demonstrate that using the same techniques, we can infer aspects of the user's personality factors, including locus of control, extraversion, and neuroticism. Further analyses show that strong results can be attained with limited observation time: in one case 95% of the final accuracy is gained after a quarter of the average task completion time. Overall, our findings show that interactions can provide information to the computer about its human collaborator, and establish a foundation for realizing mixed-initiative visual analytics systems.","article_number":"6875913","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875913","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875913/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875913/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"1663","end_page":"1672","citing_paper_count":79,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1985,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Mice","Visual analytics","Accuracy","Data visualization","Computers","Encoding"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["User Interactions","Analytic Provenance","Visualization","Applied Machine Learning"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346291","title":"iVisDesigner: Expressive Interactive Design of Information Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":25,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of EECS, Peking University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077502100","id":37077502100,"full_name":"Donghao Ren","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of EECS, Peking University","Department of Computer Science, University of California, Santa Barbara"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, University of California, Santa Barbara","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37265602700","id":37265602700,"full_name":"Tobias Höllerer","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Santa Barbara"]}},{"affiliation":"Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), Peking University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403856700","id":37403856700,"full_name":"Xiaoru Yuan","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), Peking University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present the design, implementation and evaluation of iVisDesigner, a web-based system that enables users to design information visualizations for complex datasets interactively, without the need for textual programming.

We derive recommendations for collecting perceptual similarities, and then demonstrate how the resulting kernels can be applied to automate visualization design decisions.","article_number":"6875950","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875950","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875950/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875950/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"1933","end_page":"1942","citing_paper_count":71,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1088,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Kernel","Visualization","Shape analysis","Data visualization","Encoding","Image color analysis","Color analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visualization","design","encoding","perception","model","crowdsourcing","automated visualization","visual embedding"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346594","title":"Visual Abstraction and Exploration of Multi-class Scatterplots","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":27,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085541569","id":37085541569,"full_name":"Haidong Chen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"Cyber Innovation Joint Research Center, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37291847800","id":37291847800,"full_name":"Wei Chen","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Cyber Innovation Joint Research Center, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085541429","id":37085541429,"full_name":"Honghui Mei","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085531152","id":37085531152,"full_name":"Zhiqi Liu","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37287677400","id":37287677400,"full_name":"Kun Zhou","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University"]}},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38024756400","id":38024756400,"full_name":"Weifeng Chen","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics"]}},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang GongShang University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085536562","id":37085536562,"full_name":"Wentao Gu","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhejiang GongShang University"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California at Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275869400","id":37275869400,"full_name":"Kwan-Liu Ma","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California at Davis"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Scatterplots are widely used to visualize scatter dataset for exploring outliers, clusters, local trends, and correlations.

In order to improve the performance of such classifiers, machine learning experts need to analyze classification results for a large number of labeled samples to find possible reasons for incorrect classification. Confusion matrices are widely used for this purpose. However, they provide no information about classification scores and features computed for the samples. We propose a set of integrated visual methods for analyzing the performance of probabilistic classifiers. Our methods provide insight into different aspects of the classification results for a large number of samples. One visualization emphasizes at which probabilities these samples were classified and how these probabilities correlate with classification error in terms of false positives and false negatives. Another view emphasizes the features of these samples and ranks them by their separation power between selected true and false classifications. We demonstrate the insight gained using our technique in a benchmarking classification dataset, and show how it enables improving classification performance by interactively defining and evaluating post-classification rules.","article_number":"6875957","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875957","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875957/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875957/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"1703","end_page":"1712","citing_paper_count":69,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2097,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Histograms","Probability","Probabilistic logic","Data visualization","Image color analysis","Electric breakdown"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Probabilistic classification","confusion analysis","feature evaluation and selection","visual inspection"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346325","title":"An Algebraic Process for Visualization Design","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":29,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Chicago","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282742400","id":37282742400,"full_name":"Gordon Kindlmann","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Chicago"]}},{"affiliation":"AT&T Labs","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550809300","id":37550809300,"full_name":"Carlos Scheidegger","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["AT&T Labs","University of Arizona"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present a model of visualization design based on algebraic considerations of the visualization process.

We explore how linked common work (LCW) can be employed within a `collaborative thinking space', to facilitate synchronous collaborative sensemaking activities in Visual Analytics (VA). Collaborative thinking spaces provide an environment for analysts to record, organize, share and connect externalizations. Our tool, CLIP, extends earlier thinking spaces by integrating LCW features that reveal relationships between collaborators' findings. We conducted a user study comparing CLIP to a baseline version without LCW. Results demonstrated that LCW significantly improved analytic outcomes at a collaborative intelligence task. Groups using CLIP were also able to more effectively coordinate their work, and held more discussion of their findings and hypotheses. LCW enabled them to maintain awareness of each other's activities and findings and link those findings to their own work, preventing disruptive oral awareness notifications.","article_number":"6875986","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875986","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875986/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875986/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"1633","end_page":"1642","citing_paper_count":68,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2342,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Measurement","Image resolution","Quality assessment","Data visualization","Video recording","Optimization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Sensemaking","Collaboration","Externalization","Linked common work","Collaborative thinking space"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2352953","title":"Activity Sculptures: Exploring the Impact of Physical Visualizations on Running Activity","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":31,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Munich (LMU)","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085522161","id":37085522161,"full_name":"Simon Stusak","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Munich (LMU)"]}},{"affiliation":"Université de Lyon & CNRS, Université Lyon 1, LIRIS, UMR5205, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38190079100","id":38190079100,"full_name":"Aurélien Tabard","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Université de Lyon & CNRS, Université Lyon 1, LIRIS, UMR5205, France"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Munich (LMU)","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085510125","id":37085510125,"full_name":"Franziska Sauka","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Munich (LMU)"]}},{"affiliation":"Exertion Games Lab, RMIT University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37888039900","id":37888039900,"full_name":"Rohit Ashok Khot","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Exertion Games Lab, RMIT University"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Munich (LMU)","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37299644000","id":37299644000,"full_name":"Andreas Butz","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Munich (LMU)"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Data sculptures are a promising type of visualizations in which data is given a physical form.

In this paper, we present the results of a study designed to shed light on how people transform data into visual representations. We asked people to create, update and explain their own information visualizations using only tangible building blocks. We learned that all participants, most of whom had little experience in visualization authoring, were readily able to create and talk about their own visualizations. Based on our observations, we discuss participants' actions during the development of their visual representations and during their analytic activities. We conclude by suggesting implications for tool design to enable broader support for infovis authoring.","article_number":"6875946","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875946","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875946/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875946/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2102","end_page":"2111","citing_paper_count":56,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1291,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Authoring tools","Image color analysis","Encoding","Publishing","Context awareness"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Constructive visualization","Physical visualization","Dynamic visualization","Empirical study","Token","Visualization authoring","Information visualization","Visual mapping","Novices","Visualization construction","Visual analytics"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346445","title":"TenniVis: Visualization for Tennis Match Analysis","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":37,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina at Charlotte","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085390137","id":37085390137,"full_name":"Tom Polk","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of North Carolina at Charlotte"]}},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina at Charlotte","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37292632600","id":37292632600,"full_name":"Jing Yang","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of North Carolina at Charlotte"]}},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina at Charlotte","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085373502","id":37085373502,"full_name":"Yueqi Hu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of North Carolina at Charlotte"]}},{"affiliation":"Kent State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37277701200","id":37277701200,"full_name":"Ye Zhao","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Kent State University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Existing research efforts into tennis visualization have primarily focused on using ball and player tracking data to enhance professional tennis broadcasts and to aid coaches in helping their students. Gathering and analyzing this data typically requires the use of an array of synchronized cameras, which are expensive for non-professional tennis matches. In this paper, we propose TenniVis, a novel tennis match visualization system that relies entirely on data that can be easily collected, such as score, point outcomes, point lengths, service information, and match videos that can be captured by one consumer-level camera. It provides two new visualizations to allow tennis coaches and players to quickly gain insights into match performance. It also provides rich interactions to support ad hoc hypothesis development and testing. We first demonstrate the usefulness of the system by analyzing the 2007 Australian Open men's singles final. We then validate its usability by two pilot user studies where two college tennis coaches analyzed the matches of their own players. The results indicate that useful insights can quickly be discovered and ad hoc hypotheses based on these insights can conveniently be tested through linked match videos.","article_number":"6876044","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6876044","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876044/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876044/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2339","end_page":"2348","citing_paper_count":56,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":2082,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Games","Entertainment","Data visualization","Image color analysis","Cameras","Information analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual knowledge discovery","sports analytics","tennis visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346403","title":"Characterizing Molecular Interactions in Chemical Systems","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":38,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Institut-Mines-Télécom, Télécom Paris’Iech, CNRS LTCI, Paris, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37993472500","id":37993472500,"full_name":"David Günther","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institut-Mines-Télécom, Télécom Paris’Iech, CNRS LTCI, Paris, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Sorbonne Universités, UMR 7616, Laboratoire de Chimie Théorique, Paris, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085587074","id":37085587074,"full_name":"Roberto A.

While covalent interactions impose the structural integrity of molecules, noncovalent interactions govern more subtle phenomena such as protein folding, bonding or self assembly. The understanding of these types of interactions is necessary for the interpretation of many biological processes and chemical design tasks. While traditionally the electron density is analyzed to interpret the quantum chemistry of a molecular system, noncovalent interactions are characterized by low electron densities and only slight variations of them - challenging their extraction and characterization. Recently, the signed electron density and the reduced gradient, two scalar fields derived from the electron density, have drawn much attention in quantum chemistry since they enable a qualitative visualization of these interactions even in complex molecular systems and experimental measurements. In this work, we present the first combinatorial algorithm for the automated extraction and characterization of covalent and noncovalent interactions in molecular systems. The proposed algorithm is based on a joint topological analysis of the signed electron density and the reduced gradient. Combining the connectivity information of the critical points of these two scalar fields enables to visualize, enumerate, classify and investigate molecular interactions in a robust manner. Experiments on a variety of molecular systems, from simple dimers to proteins or DNA, demonstrate the ability of our technique to robustly extract these interactions and to reveal their structural relations to the atoms and bonds forming the molecules. For simple systems, our analysis corroborates the observations made by the chemists while it provides new visual and quantitative insights on chemical interactions for larger molecular systems.","article_number":"6875922","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875922","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875922/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875922/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2476","end_page":"2485","citing_paper_count":54,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":669,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Chemicals","Bonding","Feature extraction","Isosurfaces","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Molecular Chemistry","Topological Data Analysis","Morse-Smale Complex","Join Tree"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346448","title":"Multi-Charts for Comparative 3D Ensemble Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":39,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics and Visualization Group, Technische Universität München Informatik 15, Garching, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085574383","id":37085574383,"full_name":"Ismail Demir","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics and Visualization Group, Technische Universität München Informatik 15, Garching, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics and Visualization Group, Technische Universität München Informatik 15, Garching, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38013954900","id":38013954900,"full_name":"Christian Dick","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics and Visualization Group, Technische Universität München Informatik 15, Garching, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics and Visualization Group, Technische Universität München Informatik 15, Garching, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37444424000","id":37444424000,"full_name":"Rüdiger Westermann","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics and Visualization Group, Technische Universität München Informatik 15, Garching, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"A comparative visualization of multiple volume data sets is challenging due to the inherent occlusion effects, yet it is important to effectively reveal uncertainties, correlations and reliable trends in 3D ensemble fields. In this paper we present bidirectional linking of multi-charts and volume visualization as a means to analyze visually 3D scalar ensemble fields at the data level. Multi-charts are an extension of conventional bar and line charts: They linearize the 3D data points along a space-filling curve and draw them as multiple charts in the same plot area. The bar charts encode statistical information on ensemble members, such as histograms and probability densities, and line charts are overlayed to allow comparing members against the ensemble. Alternative linearizations based on histogram similarities or ensemble variation allow clustering of spatial locations depending on data distribution. Multi-charts organize the data at multiple scales to quickly provide overviews and enable users to select regions exhibiting interesting behavior interactively. They are further put into a spatial context by allowing the user to brush or query value intervals and specific distributions, and to simultaneously visualize the corresponding spatial points via volume rendering. By providing a picking mechanism in 3D and instantly highlighting the corresponding data points in the chart, the user can go back and forth between the abstract and the 3D view to focus the analysis.","article_number":"6875990","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875990","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875990/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875990/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2694","end_page":"2703","citing_paper_count":52,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1290,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Three-dimensional displays","Data visualization","Histograms","Visualization","Image color analysis","Uncertainty"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Ensemble visualization","brushing and linking","statistical analysis"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346431","title":"Overview: The Design, Adoption, and Analysis of a Visual Document Mining Tool for Investigative Journalists","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":40,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of British Columbia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37719161300","id":37719161300,"full_name":"Matthew Brehmer","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of British Columbia"]}},{"affiliation":"University of British Columbia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37587716200","id":37587716200,"full_name":"Stephen Ingram","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of British Columbia"]}},{"affiliation":"Columbia Journalism School and the Associated Press","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085406459","id":37085406459,"full_name":"Jonathan Stray","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Columbia Journalism School and the Associated Press"]}},{"affiliation":"University of British Columbia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349490300","id":37349490300,"full_name":"Tamara Munzner","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of British Columbia"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"For an investigative journalist, a large collection of documents obtained from a Freedom of Information Act request or a leak is both a blessing and a curse: such material may contain multiple newsworthy stories, but it can be difficult and time consuming to find relevant documents.

The interaction between the various components in a city creates complex dynamics where interesting facts occur at multiple scales, requiring users to inspect a large number of data slices over time and space. Manual exploration of these slices is ineffective, time consuming, and in many cases impractical. In this paper, we propose a technique that supports event-guided exploration of large, spatio-temporal urban data. We model the data as time-varying scalar functions and use computational topology to automatically identify events in different data slices. To handle a potentially large number of events, we develop an algorithm to group and index them, thus allowing users to interactively explore and query event patterns on the fly. A visual exploration interface helps guide users towards data slices that display interesting events and trends.

One major factor is whether the animation relies on staggering-an incremental delay in start times across the moving elements. It has been suggested that staggering may reduce occlusion, while also reducing display complexity and producing less overwhelming animations, though no empirical evidence has demonstrated these advantages. Work in perceptual psychology does show that reducing occlusion, and reducing inter-object proximity (crowding) more generally, improves performance in multiple object tracking. We ran simulations confirming that staggering can in some cases reduce crowding in animated transitions involving dot clouds (as found in, e.g., animated 2D scatterplots). We empirically evaluated the effect of two staggering techniques on tracking tasks, focusing on cases that should most favour staggering. We found that introducing staggering has a negligible, or even negative, impact on multiple object tracking performance. The potential benefits of staggering may be outweighed by strong costs: a loss of common-motion grouping information about which objects travel in similar paths, and less predictability about when any specific object would begin to move. Staggering may be beneficial in some conditions, but they have yet to be demonstrated. The present results are a significant step toward a better understanding of animation pacing, and provide direction for further research.","article_number":"6876010","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6876010","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876010/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876010/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2241","end_page":"2250","citing_paper_count":45,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":752,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Animation","Data visualization","Complexity theory","Target tracking","Psychology","Tracking"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Animated transitions","staggered animation","visual tracking"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346312","title":"NeuroLines: A Subway Map Metaphor for Visualizing Nanoscale Neuronal Connectivity","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":45,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37071605900","id":37071605900,"full_name":"Ali K.

With a set of analyst-determined training samples, VAET automatically estimates the saliency of each transaction in a large time-series using a probabilistic decision tree learner. It provides an effective time-of-saliency (TOS) map where the analysts can explore a large number of transactions at different time granularities. Interesting transactions are further encoded with KnotLines, a compact visual representation that captures both the temporal variations and the contextual connection of transactions.

Here, we develop attribute signatures-interactively crafted graphics that show the geographic variability of statistics of attributes through which the extent of dependency between the attributes and geography can be visually explored. We compute a number of statistical measures, which can also account for variations in time and scale, and use them as a basis for our visualizations.

Certain tasks, however, require that insights derived from visual abstractions are verified by a human expert perusing the source text. So far, this problem is typically solved by offering overview-detail techniques, which present different views with different levels of abstractions. This often leads to problems with visual continuity. Focus-context techniques, on the other hand, succeed in accentuating interesting subsections of large text documents but are normally not suited for integrating visual abstractions. With VarifocalReader we present a technique that helps to solve some of these approaches' problems by combining characteristics from both. In particular, our method simplifies working with large and potentially complex text documents by simultaneously offering abstract representations of varying detail, based on the inherent structure of the document, and access to the text itself. In addition, VarifocalReader supports intra-document exploration through advanced navigation concepts and facilitates visual analysis tasks. The approach enables users to apply machine learning techniques and search mechanisms as well as to assess and adapt these techniques. This helps to extract entities, concepts and other artifacts from texts. In combination with the automatic generation of intermediate text levels through topic segmentation for thematic orientation, users can test hypotheses or develop interesting new research questions. To illustrate the advantages of our approach, we provide usage examples from literature studies.","article_number":"6875959","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875959","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875959/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875959/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"1723","end_page":"1732","citing_paper_count":37,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1711,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Interactive systems","Navigation","Tag clouds","Natural language processing","Text mining","Document handling","Data mining"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["visual analytics","document analysis","literary analysis","natural language processing","text mining","machine learning","distant reading"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346371","title":"Design and Evaluation of Interactive Proofreading Tools for Connectomics","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":49,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085514618","id":37085514618,"full_name":"Daniel Haehn","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University"]}},{"affiliation":"Center for Brain Science at Harvard University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085510844","id":37085510844,"full_name":"Seymour Knowles-Barley","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Center for Brain Science at Harvard University"]}},{"affiliation":"Computer Graphics Laboratory at Stanford University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085509506","id":37085509506,"full_name":"Mike Roberts","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Computer Graphics Laboratory at Stanford University"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37409575800","id":37409575800,"full_name":"Johanna Beyer","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University"]}},{"affiliation":"Center for Brain Science at Harvard University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37546755400","id":37546755400,"full_name":"Narayanan Kasthuri","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Center for Brain Science at Harvard University"]}},{"affiliation":"Center for Brain Science at Harvard University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294231800","id":37294231800,"full_name":"Jeff W.

A star glyph is a small, compact, data graphic that represents a multi-dimensional data point. Star glyphs are often used in small-multiple settings, to represent data points in tables, on maps, or as overlays on other types of data graphics. In these settings, an important task is the visual comparison of the data points encoded in the star glyph, for example to find other similar data points or outliers. We hypothesized that for data comparisons, the overall shape of a star glyph-enhanced through contour lines-would aid the viewer in making accurate similarity judgments. To test this hypothesis, we conducted three experiments. In our first experiment, we explored how the use of contours influenced how visualization experts and trained novices chose glyphs with similar data values. Our results showed that glyphs without contours make the detection of data similarity easier. Given these results, we conducted a second study to understand intuitive notions of similarity. Star glyphs without contours most intuitively supported the detection of data similarity. In a third experiment, we tested the effect of star glyph reference structures (i.e., tickmarks and gridlines) on the detection of similarity. Surprisingly, our results show that adding reference structures does improve the correctness of similarity judgments for star glyphs with contours, but not for the standard star glyph. As a result of these experiments, we conclude that the simple star glyph without contours performs best under several criteria, reinforcing its practice and popularity in the literature. Contours seem to enhance the detection of other types of similarity, e. g., shape similarity and are distracting when data similarity has to be judged. Based on these findings we provide design considerations regarding the use of contours and reference structures on star glyphs.","article_number":"6875973","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875973","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875973/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875973/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2251","end_page":"2260","citing_paper_count":35,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":863,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Shape analysis","Data visualization","Data analysis","Active contours"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Glyphs","star glyphs","contours","perception","quantitative evaluation","similarity detection","visual comparison"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346454","title":"LiveGantt: Interactively Visualizing a Large Manufacturing Schedule","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":52,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Seoul National University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085589835","id":37085589835,"full_name":"Jaemin Jo","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Seoul National University"]}},{"affiliation":"Seoul National University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085594251","id":37085594251,"full_name":"Jaeseok Huh","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Seoul National University"]}},{"affiliation":"Seoul National University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407061300","id":37407061300,"full_name":"Jonghun Park","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Seoul National University"]}},{"affiliation":"Seoul National University Bundang Hospital","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37594632900","id":37594632900,"full_name":"Bohyoung Kim","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Seoul National University Bundang Hospital"]}},{"affiliation":"Seoul National University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37422552700","id":37422552700,"full_name":"Jinwook Seo","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Seoul National University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce LiveGantt as a novel interactive schedule visualization tool that helps users explore highly-concurrent large schedules from various perspectives.

LiveGantt is built with newly designed algorithms and interactions to improve conventional charts with better scalability, explorability, and reschedulability. It employs resource reordering and task aggregation to display the schedules in a scalable way. LiveGantt provides four coordinated views and filtering techniques to help users explore and interact with the schedules in more flexible ways. In addition, LiveGantt is equipped with an efficient rescheduler to allow users to instantaneously modify their schedules based on their scheduling experience in the fields. To assess the usefulness of the application of LiveGantt, we conducted a case study on manufacturing schedule data with four industrial engineering researchers. Participants not only grasped an overview of a schedule but also explored the schedule from multiple perspectives to make enhancements.","article_number":"6875942","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875942","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875942/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875942/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2329","end_page":"2338","citing_paper_count":35,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1401,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Scheduling","Interactive systems","Filtering","Job shop scheduling","Production facilities"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Schedule visualization","event sequence visualization","simplification","exploratory interactions","simulation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346456","title":"Combing the Communication Hairball: Visualizing Parallel Execution Traces using Logical Time","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":53,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490580100","id":38490580100,"full_name":"Katherine E.

Simultaneously, the growth in scale magnifies the impact of even minor inefficiencies - potentially millions of compute hours and megawatts in power consumption can be wasted on avoidable mistakes or sub-optimal algorithms. This makes performance analysis and optimization critical elements in the software development process. One of the most common forms of performance analysis is to study execution traces, which record a history of per-process events and interprocess messages in a parallel application. Trace visualizations allow users to browse this event history and search for insights into the observed performance behavior. However, current visualizations are difficult to understand even for small process counts and do not scale gracefully beyond a few hundred processes. Organizing events in time leads to a virtually unintelligible conglomerate of interleaved events and moderately high process counts overtax even the largest display. As an alternative, we present a new trace visualization approach based on transforming the event history into logical time inferred directly from happened-before relationships. This emphasizes the code's structural behavior, which is much more familiar to the application developer. The original timing data, or other information, is then encoded through color, leading to a more intuitive visualization. Furthermore, we use the discrete nature of logical timelines to cluster processes according to their local behavior leading to a scalable visualization of even long traces on large process counts. We demonstrate our system using two case studies on large-scale parallel codes.","article_number":"6876005","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6876005","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876005/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876005/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2349","end_page":"2358","citing_paper_count":35,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":736,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Large-scale systems","Data visualization","Supercomputers","Performance analysis","Image color analysis"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Information visualization","software visualization","timelines","traces","performance analysis"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346250","title":"DimpVis: Exploring Time-varying Information Visualizations by Direct Manipulation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":54,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Ontario Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085366602","id":37085366602,"full_name":"Brittany Kondo","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Ontario Institute of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Ontario Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37669874100","id":37669874100,"full_name":"Christopher Collins","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Ontario Institute of Technology"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We introduce a new direct manipulation technique, DimpVis, for interacting with visual items in information visualizations to enable exploration of the time dimension.

The concurrent investigation of image-based and non-image data is realized in a web-based multiple coordinated view system, comprising standard views from information visualization and epidemiological data representations such as pivot tables. The views are equipped with brushing facilities and augmented by 3D shape renderings of the segmented objects, e.g., each bar in a histogram is overlaid with a mean shape of the associated subgroup of the cohort. We integrate an overview visualization, clustering of variables and object shape for data-driven subgroup definition and statistical key figures for measuring the association between variables. We demonstrate the IVA approach by validating and generating hypotheses related to lower back pain as part of a qualitative evaluation.","article_number":"6876009","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6876009","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876009/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876009/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"1673","end_page":"1682","citing_paper_count":33,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":866,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Shape analysis","Visual analytics","Image segmentation","Diseases","Medical diagnostic imaging","Risk management"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Interactive Visual Analysis","Epidemiology","Spine"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346276","title":"Nmap: A Novel Neighborhood Preservation Space-filling Algorithm","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":56,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of São Paulo, São Carlos, Sp, Brazil","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085516218","id":37085516218,"full_name":"Felipe S.

Amongst those techniques, Treemaps have received wide attention due to its simplicity, reduced visual complexity, and compact use of the available space. Several different Treemap algorithms have been proposed, however the core idea is the same, to divide the visual space into rectangles with areas proportional to some data attribute or weight. Although pleasant layouts can be effectively produced by the existing techniques, most of them do not take into account relationships that might exist between different data elements when partitioning the visual space. This violates the distance-similarity metaphor, that is, close rectangles do not necessarily represent similar data elements. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called Neighborhood Treemap (Nmap), that seeks to solve this limitation by employing a slice and scale strategy where the visual space is successively bisected on the horizontal or vertical directions and the bisections are scaled until one rectangle is defined per data element. Compared to the current techniques with the same similarity preservation goal, our approach presents the best results while being two to three orders of magnitude faster. The usefulness of Nmap is shown by two applications involving the organization of document collections and the construction of cartograms illustrating its effectiveness on different scenarios.","article_number":"6876012","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6876012","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876012/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876012/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2063","end_page":"2071","citing_paper_count":32,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1726,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Terrain mapping","Shape analysis","Image color analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Cartography"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Space-filling techniques","treemaps","distance-similarity preservation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346422","title":"Node, Node-Link, and Node-Link-Group Diagrams: An Evaluation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":57,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Arizona","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085593133","id":37085593133,"full_name":"Bahador Saket","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Arizona"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Arizona","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37680680500","id":37680680500,"full_name":"Paolo Simonetto","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Arizona"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Arizona","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37398749700","id":37398749700,"full_name":"Stephen Kobourov","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Arizona"]}},{"affiliation":"Indiana University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37283464100","id":37283464100,"full_name":"Katy Börner","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Indiana University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Effectively showing the relationships between objects in a dataset is one of the main tasks in information visualization. Typically there is a well-defined notion of distance between pairs of objects, and traditional approaches such as principal component analysis or multi-dimensional scaling are used to place the objects as points in 2D space, so that similar objects are close to each other. In another typical setting, the dataset is visualized as a network graph, where related nodes are connected by links. More recently, datasets are also visualized as maps, where in addition to nodes and links, there is an explicit representation of groups and clusters. We consider these three Techniques, characterized by a progressive increase of the amount of encoded information: node diagrams, node-link diagrams and node-link-group diagrams. We assess these three types of diagrams with a controlled experiment that covers nine different tasks falling broadly in three categories: node-based tasks, network-based tasks and group-based tasks. Our findings indicate that adding links, or links and group representations, does not negatively impact performance (time and accuracy) of node-based tasks. Similarly, adding group representations does not negatively impact the performance of network-based tasks. Node-link-group diagrams outperform the others on group-based tasks. These conclusions contradict results in other studies, in similar but subtly different settings. Taken together, however, such results can have significant implications for the design of standard and domain snecific visualizations tools.","article_number":"6876036","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6876036","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876036/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876036/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2231","end_page":"2240","citing_paper_count":32,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1111,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image color analysis","Data visualization","Visualization","Diagrams","Layout","Datasets"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["graphs","networks","maps","scatter plots"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346293","title":"PanoramicData: Data Analysis through Pen & Touch","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":58,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Brown University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085435671","id":37085435671,"full_name":"Emanuel Zgraggen","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Brown University"]}},{"affiliation":"Brown University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37612089000","id":37612089000,"full_name":"Robert Zeleznik","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Brown University"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37585786500","id":37585786500,"full_name":"Steven M.

PanoramicData (PD) addresses these problems by unifying a comprehensive set of tools for visual data exploration into a hybrid pen and touch system designed to exploit the visualization advantages of large interactive displays. PD goes beyond just familiar visualizations by including direct UI support for data transformation and aggregation, filtering and brushing. Leveraging an unbounded whiteboard metaphor, users can combine these tools like building blocks to create detailed interactive visual display networks in which each visualization can act as a filter for others. Further, by operating directly on relational-databases, PD provides an approachable visual language that exposes a broad set of the expressive power of SQL including functionally complete logic filtering, computation of aggregates and natural table joins. To understand the implications of this novel approach, we conducted a formative user study with both data and visualization experts.

Word-scale visualizations are a more general version of sparklines-small, word-sized data graphics that allow meta-information to be visually presented in-line with document text. In accordance with Edward Tufte's definition, sparklines are traditionally placed directly before or after words in the text. We describe alternative placements that permit a wider range of word-scale graphics and more flexible integration with text layouts. These alternative placements include positioning visualizations between lines, within additional vertical and horizontal space in the document, and as interactive overlays on top of the text. Each strategy changes the dimensions of the space available to display the visualizations, as well as the degree to which the text must be adjusted or reflowed to accommodate them.

Isocontour extraction is a popular method for exploring scalar fields because of its simplicity in presenting features in the data. In this paper, we present a novel representation of contours with the aim of studying the similarity relationship between the contours. The representation maps contours to points in a high-dimensional transformation-invariant descriptor space. We leverage the power of this representation to design a clustering based algorithm for detecting symmetric regions in a scalar field. Symmetry detection is a challenging problem because it demands both segmentation of the data and identification of transformation invariant segments. While the former task can be addressed using topological analysis of scalar fields, the latter requires geometry based solutions. Our approach combines the two by utilizing the contour tree for segmenting the data and the descriptor space for determining transformation invariance. We discuss two applications, query driven exploration and asymmetry visualization, that demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.","article_number":"6875976","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875976","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875976/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875976/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2427","end_page":"2436","citing_paper_count":30,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":524,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Shape analysis","Noise measurement","Isosurfaces","Level set","Feature extraction","Clustering algorithms","Multi-scale systems","Volume measurement"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Scalar field visualization","symmetry detection","contour tree","data exploration"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346626","title":"Cupid: Cluster-Based Exploration of Geometry Generators with Parallel Coordinates and Radial Trees","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":61,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Vienna University of Technology, Austrian Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073197900","id":37073197900,"full_name":"Michael Beham","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Vienna University of Technology, Austrian Institute of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Austrian Institute of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37550396200","id":37550396200,"full_name":"Wolfgang Herzner","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Austrian Institute of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Vienna University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282552200","id":37282552200,"full_name":"M.

The parameters of the generator are often sampled automatically which can lead to many similar or unwanted geometric shapes. In this paper, we propose a novel visual exploration approach that combines the abstract parameter space of the geometry generator with the resulting 3D shapes in a composite visualization. Similar geometric shapes are first grouped using hierarchical clustering and then nested within an illustrative parallel coordinates visualization. This helps the user to study the sensitivity of the generator with respect to its parameter space and to identify invalid parameter settings. Starting from a compact overview representation, the user can iteratively drill-down into local shape differences by clicking on the respective clusters. Additionally, a linked radial tree gives an overview of the cluster hierarchy and enables the user to manually split or merge clusters. We evaluate our approach by exploring the parameter space of a cup generator and provide feedback from domain experts.","article_number":"6875958","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875958","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875958/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875958/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"1693","end_page":"1702","citing_paper_count":29,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":808,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Shape analysis","Three-dimensional displays","Video games","Games","Computer vision","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Composite visualization","hierarchical clustering","illustrative parallel coordinates","radial trees","3D shape analysis"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346434","title":"Conforming Morse-Smale Complexes","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":62,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"SCI Institute, University of Utah","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37870001700","id":37870001700,"full_name":"Attila Gyulassy","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["SCI Institute, University of Utah"]}},{"affiliation":"Institut Mines-Télécom, Télécom ParisTech, CNRS LTCI, Paris, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37993472500","id":37993472500,"full_name":"David Günther","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institut Mines-Télécom, Télécom ParisTech, CNRS LTCI, Paris, France"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computing, Visual Computing Division, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37853884500","id":37853884500,"full_name":"Joshua A.

However, the quality of their geometric embedding and the sole dependence on the input scalar field data can limit their applicability when expressing application-dependent features. In this paper we introduce a new combinatorial technique to compute an MS complex that conforms to both an input scalar field and an additional, prior segmentation of the domain. The segmentation constrains the MS complex computation guaranteeing that boundaries in the segmentation are captured as separatrices of the MS complex. We demonstrate the utility and versatility of our approach with two applications. First, we use streamline integration to determine numerically computed basins/mountains and use the resulting segmentation as an input to our algorithm. This strategy enables the incorporation of prior flow path knowledge, effectively resulting in an MS complex that is as geometrically accurate as the employed numerical integration. Our second use case is motivated by the observation that often the data itself does not explicitly contain features known to be present by a domain expert. We introduce edit operations for MS complexes so that a user can directly modify their features while maintaining all the advantages of a robust topology-based representation.","article_number":"6875918","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875918","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875918/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875918/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2595","end_page":"2603","citing_paper_count":26,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":472,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Information analysis","Manifolds","Geometry","Face recognition","Feature extraction"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Computational Topology","Morse-Smale Complex","Data Analysis"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346323","title":"Moving beyond sequential design: Reflections on a rich multi-channel approach to data visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":63,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"giCentre, City University London","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399045100","id":37399045100,"full_name":"Jo Wood","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["giCentre, City University London"]}},{"affiliation":"giCentre, City University London","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085483305","id":37085483305,"full_name":"Roger Beecham","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["giCentre, City University London"]}},{"affiliation":"giCentre, City University London","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37605079900","id":37605079900,"full_name":"Jason Dykes","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["giCentre, City University London"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We reflect on a four-year engagement with transport authorities and others involving a large dataset describing the use of a public bicycle-sharing scheme.

We identify each of these as `channels'-evolving relationships between producers and consumers of visualization-where traditional roles of the visualization expert and domain expert are blurred. In each case, we identify the different design decisions that were required to support each of these channels and the role played by the visualization process. Using chauffeured interaction with a flexible visual analytics system we demonstrate how insight was gained by policy makers into gendered spatio-temporal cycle behaviors, how this led to further insight into workplace commuting activity, group cycling behavior and explanations for street navigation choice. We demonstrate how this supported, and was supported by, the seemingly unrelated development of narrative-driven visualization via TEDx, of the creation and the setting of an art installation and the curating of digital and physical artefacts. We assert that existing models of visualization design, of tool/technique development and of insight generation do not adequately capture the richness of parallel engagement via these multiple channels of communication. We argue that developing multiple channels in parallel opens up opportunities for visualization design and analysis by building trust and authority and supporting creativity. This rich, non-sequential approach to visualization design is likely to foster serendipity, deepen insight and increase impact.","article_number":"6875966","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875966","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875966/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875966/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2171","end_page":"2180","citing_paper_count":26,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1116,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Sequential analysis","Datasets","Computer interfaces","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Movement visualization","visual analytics","bikeshare","impact","visualization models","design study"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346665","title":"A Five-Level Design Framework for Bicluster Visualizations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":64,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Discovery Analytics Center, Virginia Tech","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073375900","id":37073375900,"full_name":"Maoyuan Sun","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Discovery Analytics Center, Virginia Tech"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Discovery Analytics Center, Virginia Tech","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37419565900","id":37419565900,"full_name":"Chris North","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Discovery Analytics Center, Virginia Tech"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Discovery Analytics Center, Virginia Tech","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273204200","id":37273204200,"full_name":"Naren Ramakrishnan","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Discovery Analytics Center, Virginia Tech"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Analysts often need to explore and identify coordinated relationships (e.g., four people who visited the same five cities on the same set of days) within some large datasets for sensemaking. Biclusters provide a potential solution to ease this process, because each computed bicluster bundles individual relationships into coordinated sets. By understanding such computed, structural, relations within biclusters, analysts can leverage their domain knowledge and intuition to determine the importance and relevance of the extracted relationships for making hypotheses. However, due to the lack of systematic design guidelines, it is still a challenge to design effective and usable visualizations of biclusters to enhance their perceptibility and interactivity for exploring coordinated relationships.

We summarize pros and cons of these design options to support user tasks at each of the five-level relationships.

We illustrate the extent of this sensitivity and show how it is possible to pair statistical transformations with scagnostics to enable discovery of hidden structures in data that are not discernible in untransformed visualizations.","article_number":"6875999","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875999","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875999/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875999/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"1624","end_page":"1632","citing_paper_count":24,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":714,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Shape analysis","Data visualization","Feature extraction","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Scagnostics","Scatterplot matrix","Transformation","High-Dimensional Visual Analytics"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346912","title":"LoyalTracker: Visualizing Loyalty Dynamics in Search Engines","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":68,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38019494400","id":38019494400,"full_name":"Conglei Shi","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407308300","id":37407308300,"full_name":"Yingcai Wu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia"]}},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research Asia","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406039100","id":37406039100,"full_name":"Shixia Liu","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia"]}},{"affiliation":"Shenzhen University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37405368200","id":37405368200,"full_name":"Hong Zhou","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Shenzhen University"]}},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272637300","id":37272637300,"full_name":"Huamin Qu","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"The huge amount of user log data collected by search engine providers creates new opportunities to understand user loyalty and defection behavior at an unprecedented scale.

A simulation ensemble is a collection of simulation runs of the same simulation model using different sets of control parameters. Complex engineering systems have very large parameter spaces so a naïve sampling can result in prohibitively large simulation ensembles. Interactive steering of simulation ensembles provides the means to select relevant points in a multi-dimensional parameter space (design of experiment). Interactive steering efficiently reduces the number of simulation runs needed by coupling simulation and visualization and allowing a user to request new simulations on the fly. As system complexity grows, a pure interactive solution is not always sufficient. The new approach of hybrid steering combines interactive visual steering with automatic optimization. Hybrid steering allows a domain expert to interactively (in a visualization) select data points in an iterative manner, approximate the values in a continuous region of the simulation space (by regression) and automatically find the “best” points in this continuous region based on the specified constraints and objectives (by optimization). We argue that with the full spectrum of optimization options, the steering process can be improved substantially. We describe an integrated system consisting of a simulation, a visualization, and an optimization component. We also describe typical tasks and propose an interactive analysis workflow for complex engineering systems. We demonstrate our approach on a case study from automotive industry, the optimization of a hydraulic circuit in a high pressure common rail Diesel injection system.","article_number":"6876045","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6876045","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876045/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876045/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"1803","end_page":"1812","citing_paper_count":22,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":822,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Computational modeling","Optimization","Data models","Visualization","Simulation","Analytical models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Interactive Visual Analysis","Integrated Design Environment","Simulation","Visual Steering","Automatic Optimization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346420","title":"Comparative Eye Tracking Study on Node-Link Visualizations of Trajectories","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":70,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"VISUS, University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085504694","id":37085504694,"full_name":"Rudolf Netzel","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VISUS, University of Stuttgart"]}},{"affiliation":"VISUS, University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37586953400","id":37586953400,"full_name":"Michel Burch","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VISUS, University of Stuttgart"]}},{"affiliation":"VISUS, University of Stuttgart","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268045000","id":37268045000,"full_name":"Daniel Weiskopf","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VISUS, University of Stuttgart"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present the results of an eye tracking study that compares different visualization methods for long, dense, complex, and piecewise linear spatial trajectories.

Hemodynamic information is usually extracted via computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation on a previously extracted 3D aneurysm surface mesh or directly measured with 4D phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging. In contrast, a noninvasive imaging technique that depicts the aneurysm wall in vivo is still not available. Our approach comprises an experiment, where intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is employed to probe a dissected saccular aneurysm phantom, which we modeled from a porcine kidney artery. Then, we extracted a 3D surface mesh to gain the vessel wall thickness and hemodynamic information from a CFD simulation. Building on this, we developed a framework that depicts the inner and outer aneurysm wall with dedicated information about local thickness via distance ribbons. For both walls, a shading is adapted such that the inner wall as well as its distance to the outer wall is always perceivable. The exploration of the wall is further improved by combining it with hemodynamic information from the CFD simulation. Hence, the visual analysis comprises a brushing and linking concept for individual highlighting of pathologic areas. Also, a surface clustering is integrated to provide an automatic division of different aneurysm parts combined with a risk score depending on wall thickness and hemodynamic information. In general, our approach can be employed for vessel visualization purposes where an inner and outer wall has to be adequately represented.","article_number":"6877722","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6877722","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6877722/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6877722/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2506","end_page":"2515","citing_paper_count":22,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":643,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Aneurysms","Biomedical image processing","Three-dimensional displays","Hemodynamics","Risk management","Arteries","Solid modeling","Brain modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Aneurysm","IVUS","Wall Thickness","Wall Shear Stress","Brushing and Linking","Focus + Context"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346324","title":"Sparse PDF Volumes for Consistent Multi-Resolution Volume Rendering","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":72,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085349078","id":37085349078,"full_name":"Ronell Sicat","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Duisburg-Essen","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37548560500","id":37548560500,"full_name":"Jens Krüger","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Duisburg-Essen"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Vienna","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275858700","id":37275858700,"full_name":"Torsten Möller","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Vienna"]}},{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37394809600","id":37394809600,"full_name":"Markus Hadwiger","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"This paper presents a new multi-resolution volume representation called sparse pdf volumes, which enables consistent multi-resolution volume rendering based on probability density functions (pdfs) of voxel neighborhoods.

The benefits are (1) greatly increasing the scale of local-range analysis (e.g. source-destination queries, streak surface generation) that can fit within any given limit of hardware resources; (2) improving memory and I/O bandwidth-efficiencies as well as the scalability of naive task-parallel particle advection.

We base these decisions on the correlation of the errors due to insufficient sampling and response delay, which we estimate separately using fast yet expressive heuristics. To automate the configuration of the steering behavior, we employ offline video quality analysis.

We describe the design and implementation of ViSlang, an interpreted language specifically tailored for scientific visualization. A major contribution of our design is the extensibility of the ViSlang language. Novel DSLs that are tailored to the problems of the domain can be created and integrated into ViSlang. We show that our approach can be added to existing user interfaces to increase the flexibility for expert users on demand, but at the same time does not interfere with the user experience of novice users. To demonstrate the flexibility of our approach we present new DSLs for volume processing, querying and visualization. We report the implementation effort for new DSLs and compare our approach with Matlab and Python implementations in terms of run-time performance.","article_number":"6876040","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6876040","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876040/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876040/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2388","end_page":"2396","citing_paper_count":21,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":720,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["DSL","Data visualization","Science - general","Graphics processing units","Programming","Domain specific languages"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Domain-specific languages","Volume visualization","Volume visualization framework"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346432","title":"Fast and Memory-Efficienty Topological Denoising of 2D and 3D Scalar Fields","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":76,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Institut Mines-Télécom, CNRS LTCI, Paris, France","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37993472500","id":37993472500,"full_name":"David Günther","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Institut Mines-Télécom, CNRS LTCI, Paris, France"]}},{"affiliation":"Columbia University, New York, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085463158","id":37085463158,"full_name":"Alec Jacobson","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Columbia University, New York, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"IST Austria, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590998600","id":37590998600,"full_name":"Jan Reininghaus","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["IST Austria, Vienna, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Saarbrücken, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271851300","id":37271851300,"full_name":"Hans-Peter Seidel","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Saarbrücken, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"ETH Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085473700","id":37085473700,"full_name":"Olga Sorkine-Hornung","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["ETH Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland"]}},{"affiliation":"Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Saarbrücken, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282635100","id":37282635100,"full_name":"Tino Weinkauf","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Saarbrücken, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Data acquisition, numerical inaccuracies, and sampling often introduce noise in measurements and simulations. Removing this noise is often necessary for efficient analysis and visualization of this data, yet many denoising techniques change the minima and maxima of a scalar field. For example, the extrema can appear or disappear, spatially move, and change their value. This can lead to wrong interpretations of the data, e.g., when the maximum temperature over an area is falsely reported being a few degrees cooler because the denoising method is unaware of these features. Recently, a topological denoising technique based on a global energy optimization was proposed, which allows the topology-controlled denoising of 2D scalar fields. While this method preserves the minima and maxima, it is constrained by the size of the data. We extend this work to large 2D data and medium-sized 3D data by introducing a novel domain decomposition approach. It allows processing small patches of the domain independently while still avoiding the introduction of new critical points. Furthermore, we propose an iterative refinement of the solution, which decreases the optimization energy compared to the previous approach and therefore gives smoother results that are closer to the input. We illustrate our technique on synthetic and real-world 2D and 3D data sets that highlight potential applications.","article_number":"6875939","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875939","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875939/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875939/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2585","end_page":"2594","citing_paper_count":20,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":464,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Two-dimensional displays","Three-dimensional displays","Data acquisitions","Numerical models","Noise reduction","Scalar fields","Noise measurement"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Numerical optimization","topology","scalar fields"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346423","title":"Trajectory-Based Flow Feature Tracking in Joint Particle/Volume Datasets","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":77,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085492886","id":37085492886,"full_name":"Franz Sauer","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Nebraska, Lincoln","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37401024100","id":37401024100,"full_name":"Hongfeng Yu","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Nebraska, Lincoln"]}},{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275869400","id":37275869400,"full_name":"Kwan-Liu Ma","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of California, Davis"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Studying the dynamic evolution of time-varying volumetric data is essential in countless scientific endeavors. The ability to isolate and track features of interest allows domain scientists to better manage large complex datasets both in terms of visual understanding and computational efficiency. This work presents a new trajectory-based feature tracking technique for use in joint particle/volume datasets. While traditional feature tracking approaches generally require a high temporal resolution, this method utilizes the indexed trajectories of corresponding Lagrangian particle data to efficiently track features over large jumps in time. Such a technique is especially useful for situations where the volume dataset is either temporally sparse or too large to efficiently track a feature through all intermediate timesteps. In addition, this paper presents a few other applications of this approach, such as the ability to efficiently track the internal properties of volumetric features using variables from the particle data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique using real world combustion and atmospheric datasets and compare it to existing tracking methods to justify its advantages and accuracy.","article_number":"6875975","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875975","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875975/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875975/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2565","end_page":"2574","citing_paper_count":20,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":605,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Feature extraction","Data mining","Trajectory","Atmospheric modeling","Volume measurement","Three-dimensional displays","Time-varying systems"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Feature extraction and tracking","particle data","volume data","particle trajectories","flow visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346333","title":"Low-Pass Filtered Volumetric Shadows","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":78,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37393968500","id":37393968500,"full_name":"Marco Ament","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282541900","id":37282541900,"full_name":"Filip Sadlo","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37395703400","id":37395703400,"full_name":"Carsten Dachsbacher","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37268045000","id":37268045000,"full_name":"Daniel Weiskopf","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"We present a novel and efficient method to compute volumetric soft shadows for interactive direct volume visualization to improve the perception of spatial depth. By direct control of the softness of volumetric shadows, disturbing visual patterns due to hard shadows can be avoided and users can adapt the illumination to their personal and application-specific requirements. We compute the shadowing of a point in the data set by employing spatial filtering of the optical depth over a finite area patch pointing toward each light source. Conceptually, the area patch spans a volumetric region that is sampled with shadow rays; afterward, the resulting optical depth values are convolved with a low-pass filter on the patch. In the numerical computation, however, to avoid expensive shadow ray marching, we show how to align and set up summed area tables for both directional and point light sources. Once computed, the summed area tables enable efficient evaluation of soft shadows for each point in constant time without shadow ray marching and the softness of the shadows can be controlled interactively. We integrated our method in a GPU-based volume renderer with ray casting from the camera, which offers interactive control of the transfer function, light source positions, and viewpoint, for both static and time-dependent data sets. Our results demonstrate the benefit of soft shadows for visualization to achieve user-controlled illumination with many-point lighting setups for improved perception combined with high rendering speed.","article_number":"6875905","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875905","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875905/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875905/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2437","end_page":"2446","citing_paper_count":20,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":635,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Light sources","Filtering","Scattering","Optical filters","Transfer functions","Data visualization","Volume measurement","Low-pass filters"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Direct volume rendering","volume illumination","soft shadows","filtered shadows","summed area table"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346751","title":"Visual Analytics for Comparison of Ocean Model Output with Reference Data: Detecting and Analyzing Geophysical Processes Using Clustering Ensembles","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":79,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, Potsdam, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490165500","id":38490165500,"full_name":"Patrick Köthur","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, Potsdam, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, Potsdam, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37827860500","id":37827860500,"full_name":"Mike Sips","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, Potsdam, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, Potsdam, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085557167","id":37085557167,"full_name":"Henryk Dobslaw","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, Potsdam, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, Potsdam, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38490186800","id":38490186800,"full_name":"Doris Dransch","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, Potsdam, Germany","Geography Department, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Researchers assess the quality of an ocean model by comparing its output to that of a previous model version or to observations.

However, finding a visual feature to enhance for the focus to pop out from its context in a large dynamic scene, while leading to minimal visual deformation and subjective disturbance, is challenging. This paper proposes Attractive Flicker, a novel technique for visual guidance in dynamic narrative visualizations. We first show that flicker is a strong visual attractor in the entire visual field, without distorting, suppressing, or adding any scene elements. The novel aspect of our Attractive Flicker technique is that it consists of two signal stages: The first “orientation stage” is a short but intensive flicker stimulus to attract the attention to elements of interest. Subsequently, the intensive flicker is reduced to a minimally disturbing luminance oscillation (“engagement stage”) as visual support to keep track of the focus elements. To find a good trade-off between attraction effectiveness and subjective annoyance caused by flicker, we conducted two perceptual studies to find suitable signal parameters. We showcase Attractive Flicker with the parameters obtained from the perceptual statistics in a study of molecular interactions. With Attractive Flicker, users were able to easily follow the narrative of the visualization on a large display, while the flickering of focus elements was not disturbing when observing the context.","article_number":"6876019","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6876019","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876019/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876019/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2456","end_page":"2465","citing_paper_count":19,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":881,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Context awareness","Social network services","Image color analysis","Observers","Data visualization","Data models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual attention","flicker","narrative visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346983","title":"The relation between visualization size, grouping, and user performance","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":81,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Brown University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38488457200","id":38488457200,"full_name":"Connor C.

In Experiment 1, the target square was embedded in a grid of squares and in Experiment 2 the target was a point in a scatterplot. Search performance was faster when colors were spatially grouped than when they were randomly arranged. The quantity of marks had little effect on search time for grouped displays (“pop-out”), but increasing the quantity of marks slowed reaction time for random displays. Regardless of color layout (grouped vs. random), response times were slowest for the smallest mark size and decreased as mark size increased to a point, after which response times plateaued.

While extracting these groups using a single similarity criteria is relatively straightforward, comparing alternative criteria poses additional challenges. In this paper we define visual reconciliation as the problem of reconciling multiple alternative similarity spaces through visualization and interaction. We derive this problem from our work on model comparison in climate science where climate modelers are faced with the challenge of making sense of alternative ways to describe their models: one through the output they generate, another through the large set of properties that describe them. Ideally, they want to understand whether groups of models with similar spatio-temporal behaviors share similar sets of criteria or, conversely, whether similar criteria lead to similar behaviors. We propose a visual analytics solution based on linked views, that addresses this problem by allowing the user to dynamically create, modify and observe the interaction among groupings, thereby making the potential explanations apparent.

At its core ConTour lists all items of each dataset in a column. Relationships between the columns are revealed through interaction: selecting one or multiple items in one column highlights and re-sorts the items in other columns. Filters based on relationships enable drilling down into the large data space. To identify interesting items in the first place, ConTour employs advanced sorting strategies, including strategies based on connectivity strength and uniqueness, as well as sorting based on item attributes. ConTour also introduces interactive nesting of columns, a powerful method to show the related items of a child column for each item in the parent column. Within the columns, ConTour shows rich attribute data about the items as well as information about the connection strengths to other datasets. Finally, ConTour provides a number of detail views, which can show items from multiple datasets and their associated data at the same time. We demonstrate the utility of our system in case studies conducted with a team of chemical biologists, who investigate the effects of chemical compounds on cells and need to understand the underlying mechanisms.","article_number":"6875994","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875994","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875994/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875994/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"1883","end_page":"1892","citing_paper_count":17,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":1209,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Biomedical informatics","Drugs","Data visualization","Proteins","Large-scale systems","Visual analytics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Multi-relational data","visual data analysis","drug discovery"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346258","title":"Axis Calibration for Improving Data Attribute Estimation in Star Coordinates Plots","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":84,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"URJC","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085558323","id":37085558323,"full_name":"Manuel Rubio-Sánchez","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["URJC"]}},{"affiliation":"URJC","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37270045700","id":37270045700,"full_name":"Alberto Sanchez","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["URJC"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Star coordinates is a well-known multivariate visualization method that produces linear dimensionality reduction mappings through a set of radial axes defined by vectors in an observable space. One of its main drawbacks concerns the difficulty to recover attributes of data samples accurately, which typically lie in the [0], [1] interval, given the locations of the low-dimensional embeddings and the vectors. In this paper we show that centering the data can considerably increase attribute estimation accuracy, where data values can be read off approximately by projecting embedded points onto calibrated (i.e., labeled) axes, similarly to classical statistical biplots. In addition, this idea can be coupled with a recently developed orthonormalization process on the axis vectors that prevents unnecessary distortions. We demonstrate that the combination of both approaches not only enhances the estimates, but also provides more faithful representations of the data.","article_number":"6875998","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875998","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875998/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875998/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2013","end_page":"2022","citing_paper_count":17,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":485,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Calibration","Estimation error","Linear systems","Data visualization","Multivariate regression"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Star Coordinates","RadViz","Biplots","Axis calibration","Attribute value estimation","Data centering","Orthographic projection"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346416","title":"FLDA: Latent Dirichlet Allocation Based Unsteady Flow Analysis","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":85,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), Peking University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085503743","id":37085503743,"full_name":"Fan Hong","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), Peking University"]}},{"affiliation":"Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), Peking University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085501991","id":37085501991,"full_name":"Chufan Lai","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), Peking University"]}},{"affiliation":"Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), Peking University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085681553","id":37085681553,"full_name":"Hanqi Guo","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), Peking University"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38236731500","id":38236731500,"full_name":"Enya Shen","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"]}},{"affiliation":"Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), Peking University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403856700","id":37403856700,"full_name":"Xiaoru Yuan","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), Peking University"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279611800","id":37279611800,"full_name":"Sikun Li","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel feature extraction approach called FLDA for unsteady flow fields based on Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model.

Instead, engineers seek to understand the behavior of inertial particles moving therein, for instance in sediment transport, helicopter brownout and pulverized coal combustion. In this paper, we present two strategies for the extraction of the corelines that inertial particles swirl around, which depend on particle density, particle diameter, fluid viscosity and gravity. The first is to deduce the local swirling behavior from the autonomous inertial motion ODE, which eventually reduces to a parallel vectors operation. For the second strategy, we use a particle density estimation to locate inertial attractors. With this, we are able to extract the cores of swirling inertial particle motion for both steady and unsteady 3D vector fields. We demonstrate our techniques in a number of benchmark data sets, and elaborate on the relation to traditional massless corelines.","article_number":"6875993","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875993","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875993/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875993/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2535","end_page":"2544","citing_paper_count":15,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":527,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Vectors","Gravity","Three-dimensional displays","Jacobian matrices","Time factors","Particle measurements","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Inertial particles","flow visualization","vortex cores"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346311","title":"MovExp: A Versatile Visualization Tool for Human-Computer Interaction Studies with 3D Performance and Biomechanical Data","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":88,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Max Planck Institute for Informatics","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085421134","id":37085421134,"full_name":"Gregorio Palmas","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Max Planck Institute for Informatics"]}},{"affiliation":"Max Planck Institute for Informatics","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085409365","id":37085409365,"full_name":"Myroslav Bachynskyi","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Max Planck Institute for Informatics"]}},{"affiliation":"Max Planck Institute for Informatics","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37680943800","id":37680943800,"full_name":"Antti Oulasvirta","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Max Planck Institute for Informatics"]}},{"affiliation":"Max Planck Institute for Informatics","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271851300","id":37271851300,"full_name":"Hans-Peter Seidel","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Max Planck Institute for Informatics"]}},{"affiliation":"Max Planck Institute for Informatics","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282635100","id":37282635100,"full_name":"Tina Weinkauf","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Max Planck Institute for Informatics"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), experts seek to evaluate and compare the performance and ergonomics of user interfaces.

We identified two shortcomings. First, appropriate visual encodings are missing particularly for the biomechanical aspects of the data. Second, the physical setup of the user interface cannot be incorporated explicitly into existing tools. We present MovExp, a versatile visualization tool that supports the evaluation of user interfaces. In particular, it can be easily adapted by the HCI experts to include the physical setup that is being evaluated, and visualize the data on top of it. Furthermore, it provides a variety of visual encodings to communicate muscular loads, movement directions, and other specifics of HCI studies that employ motion capture and biomechanical simulation. In this design study, we follow a problem-driven research approach. Based on a formalization of the visualization needs and the data structure, we formulate technical requirements for the visualization tool and present novel solutions to the analysis needs of the HCI experts.

It provides information about the accessibility of a biomolecule for a solvent molecule that is geometrically approximated by a sphere. During a period of almost four decades, the SES has served for many purposes - including visualization, analysis of molecular interactions and the study of cavities in molecular structures. However, if one is interested in the surface that is accessible to a molecule whose shape differs significantly from a sphere, a different concept is necessary. To address this problem, we generalize the definition of the SES by replacing the probe sphere with the full geometry of the ligand defined by the arrangement of its van der Waals spheres.

Furthermore, we show that this algorithm can also be used to compute molecular cavities that could host the ligand molecule. We provide a detailed description of its implementation on CPU and GPU. Furthermore, we present a performance and convergence analysis and compare the LES for several molecules, using as ligands either water or small organic molecules.","article_number":"6876051","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6876051","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876051/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876051/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2486","end_page":"2495","citing_paper_count":11,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":463,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Cavity resonators","Atomic measurements","Solvents","Approximation algorithms","Data visualization","Molecular imaging"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Molecular visualization","solvent excluded surface","ligand excluded surface","cavity analysis"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346447","title":"Decomposition and Simplification of Multivariate Data using Pareto Sets","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":92,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"TU Kaiserslautern","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085438249","id":37085438249,"full_name":"Lars Huettenberger","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Kaiserslautern"]}},{"affiliation":"ETH Zurich","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37410427900","id":37410427900,"full_name":"Christian Heine","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["ETH Zurich"]}},{"affiliation":"TU Kaiserslautern","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282573700","id":37282573700,"full_name":"Christoph Garth","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["TU Kaiserslautern"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Topological and structural analysis of multivariate data is aimed at improving the understanding and usage of such data through identification of intrinsic features and structural relationships among multiple variables.

The motivation for this work is that many data sets require the depiction and comparison of numbers that have varying orders of magnitude. Existing techniques for representation use bar charts, plots and colour on linear or logarithmic scales. These all suffer from related problems. There is a limit to the dynamic range available for plotting numbers, and so the required dynamic range of the plot can exceed that of the depiction method. When that occurs, resolving, comparing and relating values across the display becomes problematical or even impossible for the user. With this in mind, we present an empirical study in which we compare logarithmic, linear, scale-stack bars and our new markers for 11 different stimuli grouped into 4 different tasks across all 8 marker types.","article_number":"6875940","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875940","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875940/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875940/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2261","end_page":"2270","citing_paper_count":11,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":473,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Order of magnitude markers ","Datasets","Numerical models"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Orders of magnitude","bar charts","logarithmic scale"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346754","title":"The Spinel Explorer—Interactive Visual Analysis of Spinel Group Minerals","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":95,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"VyGLab Research Laboratory at the Universidad Nacional del Sur, Bahía Blanca, Argentina","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085462425","id":37085462425,"full_name":"María Luján Ganuza","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VyGLab Research Laboratory at the Universidad Nacional del Sur, Bahía Blanca, Argentina"]}},{"affiliation":"Departamento de Geología, Universidad Nacional del Sur, Bahía Blanca, Argentina","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085462057","id":37085462057,"full_name":"Gabriela Ferracutti","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Departamento de Geología, Universidad Nacional del Sur, Bahía Blanca, Argentina"]}},{"affiliation":"Departamento de Geología, Universidad Nacional del Sur, Bahía Blanca, Argentina","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085473991","id":37085473991,"full_name":"María Florencia Gargiulo","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Departamento de Geología, Universidad Nacional del Sur, Bahía Blanca, Argentina"]}},{"affiliation":"VyGLab Research Laboratory at the Universidad Nacional del Sur, Bahía Blanca, Argentina","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085463520","id":37085463520,"full_name":"Silvia Mabel Castro","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VyGLab Research Laboratory at the Universidad Nacional del Sur, Bahía Blanca, Argentina"]}},{"affiliation":"Departamento de Geología, Universidad Nacional del Sur, Bahía Blanca, Argentina","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085469073","id":37085469073,"full_name":"Ernesto Bjerg","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Departamento de Geología, Universidad Nacional del Sur, Bahía Blanca, Argentina"]}},{"affiliation":"Vienna University of Technology, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37284271200","id":37284271200,"full_name":"Eduard Gröller","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Vienna University of Technology, Austria"]}},{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37947312900","id":37947312900,"full_name":"Krešimir Matković","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["VRVis Research Center, Vienna, Austria"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Geologists usually deal with rocks that are up to several thousand million years old. They try to reconstruct the tectonic settings where these rocks were formed and the history of events that affected them through the geological time. The spinel group minerals provide useful information regarding the geological environment in which the host rocks were formed. They constitute excellent indicators of geological environments (tectonic settings) and are of invaluable help in the search for mineral deposits of economic interest. The current workflow requires the scientists to work with different applications to analyze spine data. They do use specific diagrams, but these are usually not interactive. The current workflow hinders domain experts to fully exploit the potentials of tediously and expensively collected data. In this paper, we introduce the Spinel Explorer-an interactive visual analysis application for spinel group minerals. The design of the Spinel Explorer and of the newly introduced interactions is a result of a careful study of geologists' tasks. The Spinel Explorer includes most of the diagrams commonly used for analyzing spinel group minerals, including 2D binary plots, ternary plots, and 3D Spinel prism plots. Besides specific plots, conventional information visualization views are also integrated in the Spinel Explorer. All views are interactive and linked. The Spinel Explorer supports conventional statistics commonly used in spinel minerals exploration. The statistics views and different data derivation techniques are fully integrated in the system. Besides the Spinel Explorer as newly proposed interactive exploration system, we also describe the identified analysis tasks, and propose a new workflow. We evaluate the Spinel Explorer using real-life data from two locations in Argentina: the Frontal Cordillera in Central Andes and Patagonia. We describe the new findings of the geologists which would have been much more difficult to achieve using the current workflow only. Very positive feedback from geologists confirms the usefulness of the Spinel Explorer.","article_number":"6875977","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875977","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875977/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875977/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"1913","end_page":"1922","citing_paper_count":11,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":585,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Minerals","Rocks","Geology","Data visualization","Three-dimensional displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Interactive visual analysis","visualization in earth","space","and environmental sciences","coordinated and multiple views","design studies"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346753","title":"Genotet: An Interactive Web-based Visual Exploration Framework to Support Validation of Gene Regulatory Networks","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":96,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085505340","id":37085505340,"full_name":"Bowen Yu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering"]}},{"affiliation":"NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38228713200","id":38228713200,"full_name":"Harish Doraiswamy","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering"]}},{"affiliation":"NYU Center for Genomics and Systems Biology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085506238","id":37085506238,"full_name":"Xi Chen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["NYU Center for Genomics and Systems Biology"]}},{"affiliation":"NYU Center for Genomics and Systems Biology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085520303","id":37085520303,"full_name":"Emily Miraldi","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["NYU Center for Genomics and Systems Biology"]}},{"affiliation":"NYU Center for Genomics and Systems Biology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085515231","id":37085515231,"full_name":"Mario Luis Arrieta-Ortiz","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["NYU Center for Genomics and Systems Biology"]}},{"affiliation":"NYU Center for Genomics and Systems Biology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37860222700","id":37860222700,"full_name":"Christoph Hafemeister","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["NYU Center for Genomics and Systems Biology"]}},{"affiliation":"Cornell University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38277605400","id":38277605400,"full_name":"Aviv Madar","author_order":7,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Cornell University"]}},{"affiliation":"NYU Center for Genomics and Systems Biology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37679158500","id":37679158500,"full_name":"Richard Bonneau","author_order":8,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["NYU Center for Genomics and Systems Biology"]}},{"affiliation":"NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275249200","id":37275249200,"full_name":"Cláudio T.

Advances in genomic technologies as well as advances in computational biology have led to multiple large regulatory network models (directed networks) each with a large corpus of supporting data and gene-annotation. There are multiple possible biological motivations for exploring large regulatory network models, including: validating TF-target gene relationships, figuring out co-regulation patterns, and exploring the coordination of cell processes in response to changes in cell state or environment. Here we focus on queries aimed at validating regulatory network models, and on coordinating visualization of primary data and directed weighted gene regulatory networks. The large size of both the network models and the primary data can make such coordinated queries cumbersome with existing tools and, in particular, inhibits the sharing of results between collaborators. In this work, we develop and demonstrate a web-based framework for coordinating visualization and exploration of expression data (RNA-seq, microarray), network models and gene-binding data (ChIP-seq). Using specialized data structures and multiple coordinated views, we design an efficient querying model to support interactive analysis of the data. Finally, we show the effectiveness of our framework through case studies for the mouse immune system (a dataset focused on a subset of key cellular functions) and a model bacteria (a small genome with high data-completeness).","article_number":"6876028","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6876028","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876028/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876028/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"1903","end_page":"1912","citing_paper_count":11,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":611,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Data visualization","Genomics","Bioinformatics","Browsers","Gene expression","Data models","Biological system modeling","Computational modeling"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Web-based visualization","gene regulatory network"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346411","title":"Visualization of Brain Microstructure Through Spherical Harmonics Illumination of High Fidelity Spatio-Angular Fields","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":97,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Maryland, College Park","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37589555100","id":37589555100,"full_name":"Sujal Bista","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland School of Medicine at Baltimore","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38015050600","id":38015050600,"full_name":"Jiachen Zhuo","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Maryland School of Medicine at Baltimore"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland School of Medicine at Baltimore","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37542850000","id":37542850000,"full_name":"Rao P.

It has shown promising results in studies on changes in gray matter and mild traumatic brain injury where DTI is often found to be inadequate. The DKI dataset, which has high-fidelity spatio-angular fields, is difficult to visualize. Glyph-based visualization techniques are commonly used for visualization of DTI datasets; however, due to the rapid changes in orientation, lighting, and occlusion, visually analyzing the much more higher fidelity DKI data is a challenge.

At the heart of VASA is the Workbench, a visual analytics application providing three distinct features: (1) low-fidelity approximations of the distributed simulation components using local simulation proxies to enable analysts to interactively configure a simulation run; (2) computational steering mechanisms to manage the execution of individual simulation components; and (3) spatiotemporal and interactive methods to explore the combined results of a simulation run. We showcase the utility of the platform using examples involving supply chains during a hurricane as well as food contamination in a fast food restaurant chain.","article_number":"6875926","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875926","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875926/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875926/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"1853","end_page":"1862","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":895,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Computational modeling","Analytical models","Data models","Meteorology","Visual analytics","Supply chains","Emergency serivces"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Computational steering","visual analytics","critical infrastructure","homeland security"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346451","title":"Trend-Centric Motion Visualization: Designing and Applying a New Strategy for Analyzing Scientific Motion Collections","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":99,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38514618500","id":38514618500,"full_name":"David Schroeder","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Minnesota"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38284404600","id":38284404600,"full_name":"Fedor Korsakov","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Minnesota"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085401395","id":37085401395,"full_name":"Carissa Mai-Ping Knipe","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Minnesota"]}},{"affiliation":"Minneapolis College of Art and Design","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38280360700","id":38280360700,"full_name":"Lauren Thorson","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Minneapolis College of Art and Design"]}},{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085409665","id":37085409665,"full_name":"Arin M.

Analyzing similarities and differences across all of the trials in these collections is a major challenge. Visualizing a single trial at a time does not work, and the typical alternative of juxtaposing multiple trials in a single visual display leads to complex, difficult-to-interpret visualizations. We address this problem via a new strategy that organizes the analysis around motion trends rather than trials. This new strategy matches the cognitive approach that scientists would like to take when analyzing motion collections. We introduce several technical innovations making trend-centric motion visualization possible. First, an algorithm detects a motion collection's trends via time-dependent clustering. Second, a 2D graphical technique visualizes how trials leave and join trends. Third, a 3D graphical technique, using a median 3D motion plus a visual variance indicator, visualizes the biomechanics of the set of trials within each trend. These innovations are combined to create an interactive exploratory visualization tool, which we designed through an iterative process in collaboration with both domain scientists and a traditionally-trained graphic designer. We report on insights generated during this design process and demonstrate the tool's effectiveness via a validation study with synthetic data and feedback from expert musculoskeletal biomechanics researchers who used the tool to analyze the effects of disc degeneration on human spinal kinematics.","article_number":"6875981","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875981","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875981/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875981/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2644","end_page":"2653","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":534,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Market research","Data visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Motion control","Biomechanics"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Design studies","focus + context techniques","integrating spatial and non-spatial data visualization","visual design","biomedical and medical visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346998","title":"Reinforcing Visual Grouping Cues to Communicate Complex Informational Structure","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":100,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"North Carolina State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37595934400","id":37595934400,"full_name":"Juhee Bae","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["North Carolina State University"]}},{"affiliation":"North Carolina State University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37356872100","id":37356872100,"full_name":"Benjamin Watson","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["North Carolina State University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In his book Multimedia Learning [7], Richard Mayer asserts that viewers learn best from imagery that provides them with cues to help them organize new information into the correct knowledge structures. Designers have long been exploiting the Gestalt laws of visual grouping to deliver viewers those cues using visual hierarchy, often communicating structures much more complex than the simple organizations studied in psychological research. Unfortunately, designers are largely practical in their work, and have not paused to build a complex theory of structural communication. If we are to build a tool to help novices create effective and well structured visuals, we need a better understanding of how to create them. Our work takes a first step toward addressing this lack, studying how five of the many grouping cues (proximity, color similarity, common region, connectivity, and alignment) can be effectively combined to communicate structured text and imagery from real world examples. To measure the effectiveness of this structural communication, we applied a digital version of card sorting, a method widely used in anthropology and cognitive science to extract cognitive structures. We then used tree edit distance to measure the difference between perceived and communicated structures. Our most significant findings are: 1) with careful design, complex structure can be communicated clearly; 2) communicating complex structure is best done with multiple reinforcing grouping cues; 3) common region (use of containers such as boxes) is particularly effective at communicating structure; and 4) alignment is a weak structural communicator.","article_number":"6875960","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875960","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875960/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875960/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"1973","end_page":"1982","citing_paper_count":10,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":768,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Information analysis","Psychology","Multimedia communication","Color analysis","Image color analysis","Visual communication"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Visual grouping","visual hierarchy","gestalt principles","perception","visual communication"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346459","title":"Stent Maps — Comparative Visualization for the Prediction of Adverse Events of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantations","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":101,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Zurich, Hybrid Laboratory for Cardiovascular Technologies, Switzerland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37590924500","id":37590924500,"full_name":"Silvia Born","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["University of Zurich, Hybrid Laboratory for Cardiovascular Technologies, Switzerland"]}},{"affiliation":"Division of Cardiovascular Surgery, University Hospital of Zurich, Switzerland","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37075072800","id":37075072800,"full_name":"Simon H.

Despite the success of TAVI, side effects such as paravalvular leakages can occur postoperatively. The goal of this project is to quantitatively analyze the co-occurrence of this complication and several potential risk factors such as stent shape after implantation, implantation height, amount and distribution of calcifications, and contact forces between stent and surrounding structure. In this paper, we present a two-dimensional visualization (stent maps), which allows (1) to comprehensively display all these aspects from CT data and mechanical simulation results and (2) to compare different datasets to identify patterns that are typical for adverse effects. The area of a stent map represents the surface area of the implanted stent - virtually straightened and uncoiled. Several properties of interest, like radial forces or stent compression, are displayed in this stent map in a heatmap-like fashion. Important anatomical landmarks and calcifications are plotted to show their spatial relation to the stent and possible correlations with the color-coded parameters. To provide comparability, the maps of different patient datasets are spatially adjusted according to a corresponding anatomical landmark. Also, stent maps summarizing the characteristics of different populations (e.g. with or without side effects) can be generated. Up to this point several interesting patterns have been observed with our technique, which remained hidden when examining the raw CT data or 3D visualizations of the same data. One example are obvious radial force maxima between the right and non-coronary valve leaflet occurring mainly in cases without leakages. These observations confirm the usefulness of our approach and give starting points for new hypotheses and further analyses. Because of its reduced dimensionality, the stent map data is an appropriate input for statistical group evaluation and machine learning methods.","article_number":"6875945","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875945","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875945/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875945/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2704","end_page":"2713","citing_paper_count":9,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":619,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Predictive models","Three-dimensional displays","Biomedical measurements","Shape analysis","Heart","Arteries","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Comparative visualization","medical visualization","vessel flattening","transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346405","title":"ADR - Anatomy-Driven Reformation","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":102,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Graphics, FAU Erlangen, and Siemens Healthcare Computed Tomography, Forchheim, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077443200","id":37077443200,"full_name":"Jan Kretschmer","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Graphics, FAU Erlangen, and Siemens Healthcare Computed Tomography, Forchheim, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Siemens Healthcare Computed Tomography, Forchheim, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38188143000","id":38188143000,"full_name":"Grzegorz Soza","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Siemens Healthcare Computed Tomography, Forchheim, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Siemens Healthcare Computed Tomography, Forchheim, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37645846600","id":37645846600,"full_name":"Christian Tietjen","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Siemens Healthcare Computed Tomography, Forchheim, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Siemens Healthcare Computed Tomography, Forchheim, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38094442600","id":38094442600,"full_name":"Michael Suehling","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Siemens Healthcare Computed Tomography, Forchheim, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Simulation and Graphics, Otto-von-Guericke University of Magdeburg, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37424645300","id":37424645300,"full_name":"Bernhard Preim","author_order":5,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Simulation and Graphics, Otto-von-Guericke University of Magdeburg, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Graphics, FAU Erlangen, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37373910900","id":37373910900,"full_name":"Marc Stamminger","author_order":6,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Graphics, FAU Erlangen, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Dedicated visualization methods are among the most important tools of modern computer-aided medical applications.

The main concept is to generate reformatted medical volumes driven by the individual anatomical geometry of a specific patient. This process generates flat views of anatomical structures that facilitate many tasks such as diagnosis, navigation and annotation. Our reformation framework is based on a non-linear as-rigid-as-possible volumetric deformation scheme that uses generic triangular surface meshes as input. To manage inevitable distortions during reformation, we introduce importance maps which allow controlling the error distribution and improving the overall visual quality in areas of elevated interest. Our method seamlessly integrates with well-established concepts such as the slice-based inspection of medical datasets and we believe it can improve the overall efficiency of many medical workflows.

In this paper we propose a novel approach that improves classification of different materials and their boundaries by combining information from the classifiers at the reconstruction stage. Our approach estimates the targeted materials' local support before performing multiple material-specific reconstructions that prevent much of the misclassification traditionally associated with transitional regions and transfer function (TF) design. With respect to previously published methods our approach offers a number of improvements and advantages. For one, it does not rely on TFs acting on derivative expressions, therefore it is less sensitive to noisy data and the classification of a single material does not depend on specialized TF widgets or specifying regions in a multidimensional TF. Additionally, improved classification is attained without increasing TF dimensionality, which promotes scalability to multivariate data. These aspects are also key in maintaining low interaction complexity. The results are simple-to-achieve visualizations that better comply with the user's understanding of discrete features within the studied object.","article_number":"6876035","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6876035","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876035/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876035/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2447","end_page":"2455","citing_paper_count":7,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":416,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image reconstruction","Boundary conditions","Data modeling","Image classification","Rendering (computer graphics)","Probabilistic logic","Data visualization"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Reconstruction","signal processing","kernel regression","volume rendering"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346425","title":"Visualizing 2-dimensional Manifolds with Curve Handles in 4D","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":104,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Pervasive Technology Institute, Indiana University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086086706","id":37086086706,"full_name":"Hui Zhang","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Pervasive Technology Institute, Indiana University"]}},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University of Media and Communication","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37667388400","id":37667388400,"full_name":"Jianguang Weng","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Zhejiang University of Media and Communication"]}},{"affiliation":"School of Informatics and Computing, Indiana University","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085342509","id":37085342509,"full_name":"Guangchen Ruan","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["School of Informatics and Computing, Indiana University"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In this paper, we present a mathematical visualization paradigm for exploring curves embedded in 3D and surfaces in 4D mathematical world.

The test can guide PV-extraction algorithms to ensure closed curves wherever the input fields are continuous, which we exemplify in extracting ridges and valleys of scalar functions.","article_number":"6875965","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875965","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875965/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875965/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2526","end_page":"2534","citing_paper_count":5,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":362,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Parity check codes","Parallel processing","Vectors","Algorithm design and analysis","Three-dimensional displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Parallel vectors","feature curve extraction","ridges and valleys","parity test"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346317","title":"Predicate-Based Focus-and-Context Visualization for 3D Ultrasound","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":107,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Chair for Computer Aided Medical Procedures, Technische Universität, München, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085346941","id":37085346941,"full_name":"Christian Schulte zu Berge","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Chair for Computer Aided Medical Procedures, Technische Universität, München, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Chair for Computer Aided Medical Procedures, Technische Universität, München, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37944985900","id":37944985900,"full_name":"Maximilian Baust","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Chair for Computer Aided Medical Procedures, Technische Universität, München, Germany"]}},{"affiliation":"Imaging and Computer Vision, Siemens Corporation, Corporate Technology, Princeton, NJ, USA","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085369396","id":37085369396,"full_name":"Ankur Kapoor","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Imaging and Computer Vision, Siemens Corporation, Corporate Technology, Princeton, NJ, USA"]}},{"affiliation":"Chair for Computer Aided Medical Procedures, Technische Universität, München, Germany","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37282965500","id":37282965500,"full_name":"Nassir Navab","author_order":4,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Chair for Computer Aided Medical Procedures, Technische Universität, München, Germany"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"Direct volume visualization techniques offer powerful insight into volumetric medical images and are part of the clinical routine for many applications. Up to now, however, their use is mostly limited to tomographic imaging modalities such as CT or MRI. With very few exceptions, such as fetal ultrasound, classic volume rendering using one-dimensional intensity-based transfer functions fails to yield satisfying results in case of ultrasound volumes. This is particularly due its gradient-like nature, a high amount of noise and speckle, and the fact that individual tissue types are rather characterized by a similar texture than by similar intensity values. Therefore, clinicians still prefer to look at 2D slices extracted from the ultrasound volume. In this work, we present an entirely novel approach to the classification and compositing stage of the volume rendering pipeline, specifically designed for use with ultrasonic images. We introduce point predicates as a generic formulation for integrating the evaluation of not only low-level information like local intensity or gradient, but also of high-level information, such as non-local image features or even anatomical models. Thus, we can successfully filter clinically relevant from non-relevant information. In order to effectively reduce the potentially high dimensionality of the predicate configuration space, we propose the predicate histogram as an intuitive user interface. This is augmented by a scribble technique to provide a comfortable metaphor for selecting predicates of interest. Assigning importance factors to the predicates allows for focus-and-context visualization that ensures to always show important (focus) regions of the data while maintaining as much context information as possible. Our method naturally integrates into standard ray casting algorithms and yields superior results in comparison to traditional methods in terms of visualizing a specific target anatomy in ultrasound volumes.","article_number":"6876031","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6876031","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876031/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876031/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2379","end_page":"2387","citing_paper_count":4,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":701,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Ultrasonic imaging","Rendering (computer graphics)","Histograms","Transfer functions","Data visualization","Context awareness","Three-dimensional displays"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Direct Volume Rendering","Ultrasound","Classification","Predicate Function","User Interface"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346457","title":"Volume-Preserving Mapping and Registration for Collective Data Visualization","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":108,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38006143400","id":38006143400,"full_name":"Jiaxi Hu","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37301933100","id":37301933100,"full_name":"Guangyu Jeff Zou","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI"]}},{"affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37285799200","id":37285799200,"full_name":"Jing Hua","author_order":3,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"In order to visualize and analyze complex collective data, complicated geometric structure of each data is desired to be mapped onto a canonical domain to enable map-based visual exploration. This paper proposes a novel volume-preserving mapping and registration method which facilitates effective collective data visualization. Given two 3-manifolds with the same topology, there exists a mapping between them to preserve each local volume element. Starting from an initial mapping, a volume restoring diffeomorphic flow is constructed as a compressible flow based on the volume forms at the manifold. Such a flow yields equality of each local volume element between the original manifold and the target at its final state. Furthermore, the salient features can be used to register the manifold to a reference template by an incompressible flow guided by a divergence-free vector field within the manifold. The process can retain the equality of local volume elements while registering the manifold to a template at the same time. An efficient and practical algorithm is also presented to generate a volume-preserving mapping and a salient feature registration on discrete 3D volumes which are represented with tetrahedral meshes embedded in 3D space. This method can be applied to comparative analysis and visualization of volumetric medical imaging data across subjects. We demonstrate an example application in multimodal neuroimaging data analysis and collective data visualization.","article_number":"6875953","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875953","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875953/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875953/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2664","end_page":"2673","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":435,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Volume measurement","Data visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Shape analysis","Information analysis","Complexity theory"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["Volume-preserving mapping","data regularization","data transformation"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346437","title":"Effects of Presentation Mode and Pace Control on Performance in Image Classification","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":109,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Eindhoven University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085351252","id":37085351252,"full_name":"Paul van der Corput","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology"]}},{"affiliation":"Eindhoven University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267249200","id":37267249200,"full_name":"Jarke J. van Wijk","author_order":2,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"A common task in visualization is to quickly find interesting items in large sets. When appropriate metadata is missing, automatic queries are impossible and users have to inspect all elements visually. We compared two fundamentally different, but obvious display modes for this task and investigated the difference with respect to effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. The static mode is based on the page metaphor and presents successive pages with a static grid of items. The moving mode is based on the conveyor belt metaphor and lets a grid of items slide though the screen in a continuous flow. In our evaluation, we applied both modes to the common task of browsing images. We performed two experiments where 18 participants had to search for certain target images in a large image collection. The number of shown images per second (pace) was predefined in the first experiment, and under user control in the second one. We conclude that at a fixed pace, the mode has no significant impact on the recall. The perceived pace is generally slower for moving mode, which causes users to systematically choose for a faster real pace than in static mode at the cost of recall, keeping the average number of target images found per second equal for both modes.","article_number":"6875979","pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875979","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875979/","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875979/","publication_title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","publication_number":2945,"is_number":6935054,"publication_year":2014,"publication_date":"31 Dec. 2014","start_page":"2301","end_page":"2309","citing_paper_count":3,"citing_patent_count":0,"download_count":408,"insert_date":"20141106","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Image classification","Time factors","Classification","Analysis of variance","Usability"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["RSVP","image classification","image browsing","multimedia visualization"]}}},{"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2352952","title":"Visualization of Regular Maps: The Chase Continues","publisher":"IEEE","issue":"12","issn":"2160-9306","rank":110,"volume":"20","authors":{"authors":[{"affiliation":"Eindhoven University of Technology","authorUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267249200","id":37267249200,"full_name":"Jarke J. van Wijk","author_order":1,"authorAffiliations":{"authorAffiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology"]}}]},"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Journals","abstract":"A regular map is a symmetric tiling of a closed surface, in the sense that all faces, vertices, and edges are topologically indistinguishable.

While the streamlines are seeded on one part of the boundary, the remaining part serves as escape border. Hence, the seeding part of the boundary represents a map of streamline behavior, indicating if streamlines reach the escape border or not. Since the resulting maps typically exhibit a very fine and complex structure and are thus not amenable to direct sampling, our approach instead aims at topologically consistent extraction of their boundary. We show that isocline surfaces of the projected vector field provide a robust basis for stream-surface-based extraction of these boundaries.
