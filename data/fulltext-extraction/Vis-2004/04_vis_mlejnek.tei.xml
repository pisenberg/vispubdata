<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION AND MEDICAL BACKGROUND</head><p>The surfaces of knee joints are covered by tissue with a complex structure, called articular cartilage. The main functions of the cartilage include distribution of weight, frictionless motion, and shock absorption. The most common cause of articular cartilage lesion is osteoarthritis. The degenerative process starts with tissue softening, and continues through swelling and thinning up to ulceration with exposure of the underlying bone. The development of osteoarthritis may take several years, however, at some point it is an irreversible process. If the diagnosis of the osteoarthritis is determined too late, a painful stiffness and a limitation of the joint's function may result <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. Since the cartilage is only a few millimeters thick, an accurate measurement of the thickness is necessary for the early determination of a joint's degeneration. Two measures, i.e., volume and thickness of the cartilage, are typically used for a quantitative characterization of the cartilage. A change in cartilage thickness indicates the progress of the disease and can be used, e.g., for the estimation of the progress of osteoarthritis, or for the evaluation of the response to therapies.</p><p>Nowadays MR scanners and pulse sequences are very well capable of imaging cartilage and allow the assessment of its quality. Spatial perception is considerably reduced when viewing the MR volume (512x512x50 resolution used in clinical practice) slice by slice or by multi-planar reconstruction. This makes reading of the data by the radiologist unnecessarily difficult and prolongs the examination time. Moreover, the articular cartilage is a curved structure. Thereby, reading of the thickness changes from a direct volume rendered or a reconstructed surface model is quite difficult (see figure 1 (a)). Until now, the default technique for visualizing cartilage thickness has been color mapping. Williams et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> visualized the cartilage thickness on the surface of the underlying bone.</p><p>Our approach to cartilage visualization deals with unfolding of the cartilage and depicting it as a height field (see figure 1 (b)). In comparison to direct volume rendering or surface reconstruction methods, the height field representation of the cartilage eliminates the complexity of the 3D shape of the cartilage. This allows the user to concentrate solely on the inspection of the cartilage thickness. The height field representation of the cartilage offers several visualization modes for representing the thickness information: color mapping, scaling, glyphs, iso-lines, etc. The entire cartilage is depicted at once, thus, giving an overview of the global thickness.</p><p>General surfaces cannot be flattened without some amount of distortion. The distortion can be reduced, or in some cases (e.g., developable surfaces) even eliminated by introducing cuts and seams. Such operations split the surface and introduce discontinuities, thus, losing spatial relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. In our approach we locally minimize the distortion, in a userdefined area of interest (focus). The remaining part of the cartilage (context) is depicted in order to give an overview of the thickness of the entire cartilage. Since the overall thickness of the cartilage is different for each patient (according to the patient's body mass, age, sex, etc.), it is necessary to see the entire surface at once while inspecting it. The focal point on the surface of the cartilage can be interactively selected by the user.</p><p>The main contribution of this work is the handling and processing of articular cartilage as a typical thin-wall object. Another example would be colon walls. These objects have two dimensions with significant extent, whereas the third dimension (the thickness) is considerably smaller. The substantial difference in size requires the application of anisotropic operations (e.g., non-uniform scaling in thickness direction). We investigate surface flattening and discuss visualization techniques, which can be applied to the flattened surface.</p><p>Flattening requires the parameterization of the surface. In this respect a large body of work has been done for texture mapping purposes. The unfolding of anatomical structures has been discussed as an investigation tool in several areas of medical imaging, e.g., colon unfolding <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>, curved planar reformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, or flattening of the brain surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. For these applications, the primary goal of the parameterization is usually the minimization of the global distortion over the entire surface. This process is time consuming and does not allow an interactive input from the user. In many medical applications, recent research has concentrated on detecting and investigating relatively small features. Therefore, we make use of local minimization of the distortion, preserving the shape and size of the area of interest, which can be interactively changed.</p><p>The paper is structured as follows. First, the visualization pipeline for thickness visualization will be sketched, describing the sequential stages in detail. Afterwards, an overview of operations on the resulting height field will be given in section 3. Finally, we summarize and conclude the work in section 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">PIPELINE FOR THICKNESS VISUALIZATION</head><p>The proposed pipeline for thickness visualization consists of the following steps (see <ref type="figure">figure 2)</ref>. First, the raw volumetric data are semi-automatically segmented to identify the cartilage regions. In the second step, the distance between the inner and outer cartilage boundary is computed using a distance transform. Finally, the outer surface of the pre-segmented cartilage is triangulated using the min-imum edge criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. All these operations are done in the preprocessing step. The following steps are guided by the user who is provided with an immediate visual feedback. The flattening of the triangular mesh proposed in this paper is based on similar principles as the work by Sorkine et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, however, we use different criteria for grading of the free vertices. We enable the user to interactively select a focal point, where the thickness shall be examined locally. The flattened mesh with assigned per-vertex thickness values corresponds to a height field with a triangulated base that consists of about 20K triangles. Thus, the operations on the height field can be performed in real-time on commodity hardware. In the following, we will describe the pipeline steps in detail. The segmentation procedure is shortly described in section 2.1. Section 2.2 discusses the measurement of cartilage thickness, while in section 2.3 we explain the flattening of the surface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Cartilage Segmentation</head><p>In order to describe the entire visualization pipeline, the segmentation process is shortly sketched in this section. However, the discussion on the segmentation of the cartilage is not significant to the contribution of the paper. In the literature, several approaches to cartilage segmentation have been discussed. Two main classes of segmentation methods are usually applied: manual segmentation and semi-automatic segmentation. If slice-by-slice segmentation is applied, it is usually carried out on sagittal slices. Along this direction, the topology of extracted cartilage contours does not radically change between the adjacent slices. Since the scanned MRI data are generally anisotropic, i.e., the in-plane voxel distance is smaller than the slice thickness, additional linearly interpolated contour slices are usually inserted between the adjacent slices.</p><p>Manual segmentation is usually time-consuming and requires an experienced user in order to obtain satisfactory results. Semiautomatic methods use thresholding, region growing, snakes, or edge detection filters in order to help the user in the segmentation.</p><p>To segment the cartilage from the MRI volume, we use an active contour model (snake) controlled by forces proposed by Lobregt et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. A snake, initially introduced by Kass et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, is a parametric deformable contour. It is controlled by internal and external forces, which are usually defined in energy terms. The internal forces keep the snake smooth, while the external forces attract it to features, such as object boundaries.</p><p>The outcome of the segmentation is the contour of the cartilage in a slice. Due to our interest in the thickness of the tissue on the outer surface, the contour is split into two parts (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">figure 3)</ref>. The first part is the inner boundary (green line) which is adjacent to the underlying bone. The second part of the contour is the outer boundary (red line) of the cartilage (blue). In the next step, we calculate the thickness from the outer to the inner boundary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Thickness Measurement</head><p>There are several possibilities to calculate the thickness of a thin tissue. Heuer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> summarize three possibilities to measure cartilage thickness: vertical distance, proximity method (closest neighbor on the opposite surface), and normal distance (distance along the normal vector). For curved surfaces, the vertical distance metric is not appropriate since the computation of the distance is performed always along a constant (vertical) direction.</p><p>Applying the proximity method, we are looking for the Euclidean distance D E () between a point p belonging to the outer boundary of the cartilage and the nearest point r belonging to the inner boundary I.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">D E (p) = min( (p x − r x ) 2 + (p y − r y ) 2 + (p z − r z ) 2 ); r ∈ I</formula><p>The distance computation can be efficiently approximated by the calculation of a distance field starting from the underlying bone. Recently, many optimizations of distance transforms have been discussed in the literature. They can be grouped into two categories: chamfer distance transforms and vector distance transforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The chamfer distance transform propagates the local distance by adding the neighborhood values, thus, propagating also the errors. On the other hand, the vector distance transform, introduced by Danielsson <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, propagates the distance vector to the nearest sample point of the object surface, thus, minimizing the average error. Vector distance transforms are in general slower than chamfer distance transforms. We are computing the distance field only for a thin cartilage layer close to the bone surface. Since we need an accurate measurement of the thickness, we use the computationally more expensive, but more accurate vector distance transform by Mullikin <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Flattening of Articular Cartilage</head><p>In order to perform unfolding of the cartilage, it is necessary to parameterize the outer boundary of the cartilage. Parameterizations of surfaces are often used in the area of texture mapping. In order to measure the precision and faithfulness of the parameterization, several different metrics, e.g., based on preservation of lengths, angles, or areas, can be applied <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. There are several parameters which can be adjusted in order to determine the trade-off between the different types of distortions and interactive frame rates. The setting of the parameters depends on the specific application. For the purpose of flattening the curved surface of the cartilage into the corresponding 2D plane, the parameterization should fulfill the following criteria:</p><p>• We are interested not only in the thickness of the inspected part of the cartilage, but also in its size. Therefore, we need a parameterization, which minimizes area distortion. The ideal solution is an equiareal mapping.</p><p>• Local as well as global intersections have to be preventedthis is a common problem in the area on surface parameterization.</p><p>• We do not allow multiple patches -the entire cartilage is rendered as one height field in order to keep spatial relations.</p><p>• Since the distortion cannot be eliminated for the entire patch, we allow interactive selection of an area of interest, where the distortion is primarily minimized.</p><p>• The parameterization has to be fast in order to allow interactive feedback.</p><p>As mentioned above, our parameterization technique has been inspired by the method presented by Sorkine et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Since the cartilage contours are organized in planar slices, we need to prevent intersections of the contours also in parametric space. We deal with this problem in the following way. In order to efficiently prevent local as well as global intersections, we align all points belonging to one contour onto a line. This reduces the distortion minimization issue to a one dimensional optimization problem, thus, enabling reasonable frame rates.</p><p>In order to meet all of the above mentioned constraints we grow a planar patch around the selected triangle in the following manner. First, the focal triangle, the one which includes the focal point, is rigidly transformed into the 2D plane. Since the triangle vertices are arranged in planar contours, each triangle consists of two points (p1, p2) belonging to one contour and the third one (p3) belonging   to the neighboring contour. The distance between these two slices is defined by the height of the focal triangle (height = 2•area |p2−p1| ) (see <ref type="figure">figure 4)</ref>. Moreover, we define as an active set those points which have not been added to the patch yet but are forming a triangle with two points on the boundary of the patch. In the next step the patch is iteratively flattened by adding active points a i to the patch. Positions of a i are selected on the line corresponding to a contour so that, for example, the area of the currently flattened triangle is preserved. In this way, in each step a triangle nearest to the focal point is newly added to the patch. Note that arrangement of the points in the contours prevents local as well as global intersections. Any other surface parameterization method, based on different constrains, can be performed in a similar way. The selection of the focal triangle is performed during the inspection by a mouse click on the surface of the height field. Notice, that, due to the above mentioned alignment of the processed points, the distortion minimization for a new focal triangle yields an interactive feedback. Thus, the user is able to investigate all suspicious areas of the cartilage within several seconds.</p><p>For the sake of clarity, we illustrate the method on a simple example. Assume, we want to minimize the area distortion. <ref type="figure">Fig-(a)</ref> (b) ure 6 demonstrates the difference between selecting two different focal triangles (red or green, see figure 6 (a)). The selected triangle is rigidly transformed to the patch and determines the distance between the transformed contours (see figure 6 (b),(c)). Further added triangles preserve their area by changing the distance inside the contour.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">OPERATIONS ON THE HEIGHT FIELD</head><p>The planar representation of the curved cartilage surface enables effective visualization of its thickness. Slight changes in the thickness on the reconstructed surface may, however, not be noticeable (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">figure 7 (a)</ref>). The intuitive approach -uniform scaling will not bring any improvement. Since we would like to enhance the thickness information, we propose a non-uniform scaling by applying scaling only in the height direction (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">figure 7 (b)</ref>). This has already been done for earth visualizations to emphasize topographic variations like mountains and valleys. Note, that the below described operations, i.e., non-uniform scaling, may lead to intersections for non-convex surfaces. The height field representation of the thickness information does not have to deal with this problem. The triangulated surface is flattened into the 2D plane and the thickness is mapped to the third coordinate. Thus, the height field can be scaled in the thickness direction without distorting the thickness values (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">figure 5)</ref>. Similarly, any two-dimensional technique can be applied in order to visualize scalar or vector values on the curved surface. To illustrate the wide application area we discuss several visualization techniques for height fields, which exploit the flattening of a curved surface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Thresholded Non-linear Scaling</head><p>In the case of cartilage visualization, we are interested in areas where the cartilage is thinning. Therefore, we want to inspect those areas, where the thickness is below a certain threshold. When scaling the entire height field, the enhancement of areas which are of no interest may disturb the inspection, or hide the parts of the height field where the thickness is rather low. This is especially true if the variation of the thickness, which is of interest, is relatively small as compared to the overall thickness range. Therefore, in addition to the non-uniform scaling, we propose a thresholded non-linear scaling (see <ref type="figure">figure 9)</ref>. The thresholding of the values above the predefined threshold will flatten the high values, thus, performing the scaling only on the values below the threshold. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 10</ref> (a) illustrates this concept.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Non-linear Scaling on Interval</head><p>A natural extension to the thresholded non-linear scaling is the scaling on a certain range of thickness values. An arbitrary number of (a) (b) value ranges can be defined in order to perform custom scaling for each interval. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> illustrates a case with three height intervals. Assume, we are interested only in the pathologic cases, i.e., where the thickness is below one threshold and above another threshold. Three intervals are defined for low, middle and high thickness values. A linear scaling can be defined for each interval, respectively. Setting the scaling factor to zero for the values in the range between the two thresholds, allows the user to concentrate on the areas with the suspicious/specific values (circle) (see <ref type="figure">figure 8 (c)</ref>). The idea is sketched in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">figure 10 (b)</ref>.</p><p>The following examples show the extraction of the thickness information enhanced by color coding (see <ref type="figure">figure 11)</ref>, by iso-lines (a) (b) <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>: Surface of the cartilage without (a) and with the nonlinear scaling (b). By increasing the scale factor it is possible to inspect also tiny changes in the thickness of the tissue. (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">figure 12)</ref>, and by glyphs (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">figure 13)</ref>. These representations of the unfolded cartilage yield additional information to the visualization, e.g., absolute thickness, or thickness gradient magnitude.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Scale Transfer Function</head><p>As mentioned above the overall thickness of the cartilage varies from patient to patient. Thus, we need a tool which enables detection of subtle thickness changes on each range of the thickness values. Using the basic non-linear scaling approach, interesting features may be occluded by other scaled areas, which are not of interest. This drawback can be overcome by generalizing the thresholded non-linear scaling. We define a continuous piecewise linear scaling transfer function <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, which maps the original thickness val- ues, assigned to each vertex, to the scaled values (see <ref type="figure">figure 14)</ref>. Note, that the intervals parallel to the x-axis correspond to flattening of the field (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">figure 14, interval 3)</ref>. Thickness preservation is performed on intervals, where x = y (see figure 14, interval 1 and 4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have presented a method to visualize the thickness of curved thin objects. The approach has been illustrated on the visualization of articular cartilage. This is a structure where the detection of slight thickness changes is vital for diagnosis. It has been shown that unfolding of anatomic organs is promising since it enables the application of 2D visualization methods. Application of these methods is not possible on the curved reconstructed surfaces. The above described work has been implemented as a part of a framework for cartilage visualization. It includes several linked views, which allow inspection of the articular cartilage with backcoupling to the reconstructed surface as well as to the original slices.</p><p>The future work on articular cartilage visualization will continue with a broader clinical study on a variety of datasets. This will include experimental validation and proof of the usefulness of the applied methods on a couple of scenarios from different modalities. Furthermore, in the scope of the project we aim for faster and more robust segmentation methods.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>October 10 -Figure 2 :</head><label>102</label><figDesc>15, Austin, Texas, USA IEEE Visualization 2004 0-7803-8788-0/04/$20.00 ©2004 IEEE Pipeline for thickness visualization.</figDesc></figure>
