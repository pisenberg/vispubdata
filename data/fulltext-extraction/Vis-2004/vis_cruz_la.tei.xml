<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) is a manifestation of atherosclerosis. It is characterized by the formation of atherosclerotic plaque on the inner surface of the vessel wall, which protrudes into the vessel lumen, causing luminal narrowing (stenosis) or complete vessel occlusion. The reduced blood flow to the legs at first causes cramping with exercise or walking, and, at later stages of the disease, rest pain and tissue loss, which may eventually require amputation. Vascular imaging plays a pivotal role for diagnosis, staging, and treatment planning in patients with PAOD. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) has recently evolved into a routinely applicable imaging technique to visualize the entire peripheral (lower extremity) arterial tree. A peripheral CTA dataset consists of up to 2000 transverse CT slices, and thus cannot be assessed by the radiologist or treating physician without further image postprocessing. Accurate and automated extraction of the peripheral arterial tree from peripheral CTA datasets is thus highly desirable from the visualization point of view. This is not a trivial task, however, particularly in the presence of atherosclerotic disease. Healthy arteries are characterized by a fairly homogenous CT density of the vessel lumen due to the contrast-medium enhanced blood. Blood is higher in x-ray attenuation than the surrounding soft tissues (muscles, fat), and which is generally lower in attenuation than neighbouring bony tissue. Diseased arterial segments, however, may have very different xray attenuation. Non-calcified atherosclerotic plaque is isodense to soft tissues, and calcified plaque has a CT density similar to bone. Hence, it is not surprising that density and gradient information alone is insufficient to accurately extract the centerlines of a diseased arterial tree. The overlap in density ranges is further aggravated by the wide range of diameters observed for individual branches of the arterial tree, as well as by the presence of image noise, scanning artifacts, limited scanner resolution with partial volume averaging, and finally, inter-individual and within-patient variability of arterial opacification.</p><p>The most characteristic feature of an artery (healthy or diseased) is its cylindrical or tubular shape. A tubular or cylindric shape can be modeled as elliptical or circular cross-sections along its medial October 10-15, Austin, Texas, USA IEEE Visualization 2004 0-7803-8788-0/04/$20.00 ©2004 IEEE axis, and can then be fitted to a candidate vascular structure. As a result of the estimated vessel diameter and density, a more robust extraction of the vessel centerline is expected, even in the presence of atherosclerotic disease. We are particularly interested in finding a model that best fits the data concerning tubular shape and mean density value.</p><p>In this work, we propose two new strategies to estimate vessel parameters from an initial vessel model using a non-linear minimization process. The first strategy attempts to fit an elliptical cross-section-model to the vessel. The second strategy uses a 3D cylindrical model of the vessel to fit it to the data.</p><p>The paper is divided into six sections. Section 2 provides an overview of related approaches concerning model based segmentation techniques applied to vascular structure. Section 3 describes the main motivation of this work and the importance of extracting a better parameterization of diseased blood vessels. Section 4 presents the non-linear model fitting technique using an elliptical cross-section (in 2D) and a cylindrical shape (in 3D). In section 5 we present and discuss our results and finally, in section 6 draw the conclusions of this work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Kirbas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> classified several segmentation methods according to the technique used. They point out that there is no single segmentation method that allows to extract the vasculature across different medical imaging modalities and not even across different vascular anatomic territories. Some methods use threshold values, or an explicit vessel model to extract contours. Other techniques require image processing (depending on the data, quality, noise, artifacts), a priori segmentation, or post-processing.</p><p>Deformable models <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and multiscale methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> have been used more recently, and appear to be the most promising segmentation techniques. Deformable models are powerful and widely used methods for segmentation and geometric model generation in 2D and 3D data <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. They can be used for any modality <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. These techniques are based on a minimization process of an energy function. This energy function involves internal and external forces. The internal forces allow smoothness of the contour and the external forces move the deformable structure towards edges of the underlying data. Depending on the definition of the energy function, the deformable model inflates or shrinks towards the object. Nevertheless, these techniques are strongly dependent on the initialization. The energy function uses the gradient information or derivative values around the deformable object. In constrasct, multiscale methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> are based on the extraction of large structures at low resolution images and fine structures at high resolution images. Multiscale filtering uses the Hessian matrix which contains the second derivatives of the data. Our experimental results on synthetic and real clinical data <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> suggest that even the gradient information and derivatives are not sufficient to accurately extract the centerlines of peripheral arteries. This is due to the overlapping of density ranges between vascular and non-vascular structures, the variability in opacification between patients and from aorta to pedal vessels, image noise, and partial volume averaging.</p><p>Classical model based segmentation algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref> applied to vessel extraction are based on fitting circular, elliptical or cylindrical geometric models to the data. Such techniques combine thresholds with gradient information <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> or derivative estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> in order to approximate the vessel boundary. Then, this initial boundary estimation is fitted to a geometrical model (circular or elliptical cross-section or cylindrical structure).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">MOTIVATION FOR A MODEL-BASED VESSEL PARAME-TERIZATION</head><p>Automatic segmentation and accurate centerline identification of diseased arteries certainly is a challenge. We are currently using a density and gradient based vessel tracking and centering technique to process clinical cases of patients with PAOD <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In patients with extensive disease, substantial expert user interaction and manual corrections are necessary to bridge the segments where standard segmentation fails. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> is an illustration of extensively diseased vessel territories where expert user interaction was required to generate images of adequate diagnostic quality. In this case, a technique capable of identifying the vessel by its cylindrical or tubular shape might have yielded a similar or better result in determining the centerline. This would improve the visualization technique actually used in the clinical environment, which is mostly Curved Planar Reformation (CPR) and its extensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">NON-LINEAR MODEL FITTING</head><p>In this paper, we present two different vessel models. An elliptical model in 2D and a cylindrical model in 3D. Each model has a set of unknown parameters, which are estimated by minimization of a χ 2 -based merit function. Both methods require an initial estimation of the parameters. They can either be obtained from the initial path defined by vessel tracking, or the previous slices, which requires only an initial seed point.</p><p>We represent the vessel by a 2D (ellipse in a slice) or 3D (cylinder) implicit model f . The CT-Scanner, due to finite dimensions of its detectors, blurs the data, which leads to partial volume effects (PVE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. This can be modeled by a non ideal point spread function (PSF) of the scanner, which we can approximate with a Gaussian G σ . Then we model the PSF by estimating the distance to the surface (Eq. 1) and by calculating the density (Eq. 2):</p><p>First, a distance to the geometrical object is estimated for an implicit function by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">dist = f ∇ f ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where f is the implicit function of the geometrical object. The PSF from the CT-Scanner can be modeled by a Gaussian with variance σ applied to the distance to the geometrical object. Finally, the mean density is computed by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">density = b +V × G σ (dist),<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where b is the mean density value for non-vessel tissue or background and V is the mean density value for vessels. Since a convolution of a unit step with a Gaussian results in the erfc function, we use this function instead of G σ . erfc is defined as the complementary error function encountered in integrating the Gaussian distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Therefore for the estimation of the PSF we substitute G σ (dist) by erfc(dist/σ ).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">RESULTS</head><p>As first result, we apply both model fitting to a synthetic data set. This should illustrate that both methods produce quite similar results concerning the curvature (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>). The synthetic data set consists of 3D data of 256x256x768 voxels with size 0.5 3 mm. The diameter varies along the z-axis from about 0.7 to about 23 voxels, simulating the size-range of arterial vessels imaged with CT. The vessel density is defined between 1130 and 1350 and the background density between 1080 and 1100 (which corresponds to CT attenuation values of 130 to 350, and 80 to 100 Hounsfield Units, respectively). The curvature of the vessel is simulated by a helix with an angle of 32.14 and radius of 76.8 voxels. We apply the cylindrical model fitting to a real patient dataset in a region of interest where manual segmentation by experts is required (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figures 6 and 7</ref> show the results of fitting an initial model to a set of ten slices of volumetric data, starting from an initial seed point. In the Figures, the first and last columns of images correspond to the first and the last slice of a sub-volumetric region defined by a set of 10 slices (as an example). The center column of images correspond to the slice in the middle of the dataset. The upper row of images corresponds to a partially occluded or calcified vessel. The second row of images corresponds to the fitted model. Finally, the third row is a superposition of the cylinder enclosing the vessel. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>, we can see that there is not a clear distinction between the vessel boundary and soft tissue or vessel background. It looks like a bifurcation, but it is not. This is certainly a difficult case where any other preprocessing step using derivative estimation, gradient information or thresholds are likely to fail. However the cylindrical vessel model fits quite well to the sub-volumetric data of the vessel. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref> shows the result on a calcified vessel. This is also a difficult case to segment. From the medical point of view it is quite important to extract the entire vessel dimensions, rather than the lumen only, because it allows an estimation of the relative degree of a stenosis. In both cases <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figures 6 and 7)</ref> the density of the fitted model corresponds to the mean density of the data. This would help to combine this technique with an adaptive process to correct for inter-and within-individual variation of the degree of vascular opacification, and to distinguish vessels from other structures, such as bone. Finally, we present a comparison of the cylindric model with a clinical application. It is based on the ray casting technique (RCT) developed by Kanitsar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and evaluated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> as a good approximation of the vessel centerline. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8</ref> presents the center path generated by the RCT (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8(a)</ref>) and the cylindrical model fitting (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8 (b)</ref>). Here, we can see how the centerline generated by the RCT is not actually in the center. The centerline extracted from the cylindrical model fitting looks more centered (see zoomed circular area, showed in <ref type="figure">Figures 9(a)</ref> and (b)).</p><p>Figures 9 (a) and (b), are particularly relevant because they show one of the limitations of the CPR <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> visualization technique, which is its dependence on an accurate centerline estimation. An off-axis reformatting surface for the CPRs causes artificial vessel narrowing or 'pseudo-stenoses' in the resulting image (see zoomed circular  <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>). Figures 9 also allow us to visually determine that the cylindrical model fitting gives a better center approximation and avoids the generation of artificial stenoses in the CPR images. The vessel segmented in <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref> is characterized by a complex pattern of densities within the diffusely diseased left femoral artery. There are pockets of residual lumen (light grey), irregular areas of non-calcified plaque (dark grey), and areas of calcified atherosclerotic plaque (white). The centerlines and CPR images from the cylindrical model fitting are more accurate than the RCT based results, and compare favorably to those based on expert user interactions.</p><p>Concerning the performance, for a dataset of 512x512x224 voxels, the process took about 210 seconds, that means 0.9 seconds per slice. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> summarizes the advantages and limitations using nonlinear model fitting.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION</head><p>This work presents a strategy to parameterize a vascular structure from a vessel model by a non-linear fitting process. The Levenberg-Marquardt method is used as a non-linear minimization process, which allows to extract optimal parameters from a model that best fits the data.  In this paper, we present a segmentation solution for visualization and analysis purposes in cases where classical segmentation methods based on boundary detection often fail. Diseased vessels show a wide variability of density values, which is a challenge because calcifications appear as bones and partial occlusion or soft plaques appear as soft tissues. This makes it difficult to detect the vessel boundaries. The cylindrical 3D model fitting requires neither a preprocessing step nor any operator estimation, such as, gradient, derivative, etc.</p><p>The cylindrical model fitting can be considered as initial step to implement an automatic segmentation of vascular structures. Future work should address the following issues: performance, handling of vessel bifurcations, and inclusion of further anatomical knowledge. An evaluation of robustness is required using this technique, which will help to evaluate the choice of initial parameters.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>MIP image (left) of a clinical peripheral CTA dataset obtained from a patient with advanced peripheral arterial disease with superimposed tree of vessel-centerlines.
