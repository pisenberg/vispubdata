For example, texture mapping can be used to enhance the visual quality and generate different visual results. Geometric morphing can be used to generate vivid animation results. Essentially, surface parametrization can convert a 3D geometric problem to 2D, thereby improving the efficiency and simplifying the computation. Conformal surface parameterizations have many merits: they preserve angular structure, are intrinsic to geometry, and are stable with respect to different triangulations and small deformations. It has been widely used for many applications, such as non-distorted texture mapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, surface remeshing <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, surface fairing <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, surface matching <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, brain mapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> etc.</p><p>It is desirable to parameterize surfaces globally without any seams. The existence of global conformal parameterization is a non-trivial fact. This is equivalent to the fact that all orientable surfaces are Riemann surfaces. The atlas formed by the global conformal parameterization is the so-called conformal structure. Conformal structure is a fundamental structure between metric structure and topological structure and governs many natural physical phenomena. The abstract concept of a Riemann surface can also be visualized by texture mapping special patterns using global conformal parameterizations. This is the only means of visually conveying conformal information of surfaces.</p><p>The early work of global conformal parameterization has been done in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>, where the basis for all possible global conformal parameterizations are computed. Because global conformal parameterization is non-unique, the problem of finding the optimal one remains open.</p><p>This paper introduces an explicit method to find the optimal global conformal parameterizations of arbitrary surfaces. First, the metrics for measuring the quality of conformal parameterizations are designed. Second, the major factors affecting the quality of the parameterization are summarized. Then, algorithms are developed to modify the topology, locate the zero points, and determine the cohomology types of the differential forms. The method is based October 10-15, Austin, Texas, USA IEEE Visualization 2004 0-7803-8788-0/04/$20.00 ©2004 IEEE on finite dimensional optimization and demonstrated by visualizing the Riemann surface structure of real surfaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Contributions</head><p>This paper introduces algorithms to optimize global conformal parameterizations. The method is based on Riemann surface theories and differential geometry. Therefore, it is rigorous and general. The optimization algorithms can be generalized to all parameterization methods based on convex combinations <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Our main contributions are listed as follows.</p><p>1 We introduce energy functionals on the space of complexvalued holomorphic mappings.</p><p>2 In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, the author raised the following open question: "Under what boundary condition is a harmonic map between two topological disks conformal?" We answer this question in an algorithmic way. We compute the double covering of a topological disk (double covering means gluing two copies of the same surface along their boundaries to form a closed symmetric surface; details are described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>), and conformally map the double covering to a sphere preserving the symmetry. Thus the disk itself is mapped to a hemisphere. Then a conformal map between two disks is induced by their mappings to the same hemisphere. The boundary condition which makes a harmonic map conformal can be computed using this algorithm directly.</p><p>3 The difference between the zero points of a conformal parameterization and singularities of general vector fields is that the zero points cannot be arbitrarily assigned and are determined by the conformal structure. To the best of our knowledge, this statement has never been addressed in computer graphics, although it is the major topological obstruction for any surface parameterization method. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> We propose a way of finding the optimal Möbius transform that best balances area deformations (note that conformality is invariant through Möbius transforms.)</p><p>5 This paper explains the following fact: the area stretching factor increases exponentially at the tip of long tubes and it is true for all other parameterization methods. This shows the limits of current parameterization techniques and justifies topological modification techniques proposed in this paper. Although some researchers reached the same conclusion by heuristic methods, a rigorous proof is given in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Related Work</head><p>Surface conformal parameterization algorithms have been thoroughly studied in the literature. We summarize them according to the topologies of surfaces that they can handle.</p><p>Conformal map for topological disks Many researchers propose methods to build a conformal map for topological disks. Pinkall and Polthier derive the discrete Dirichlet energy in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Eck et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> introduce the discrete harmonic map, which approximates the continuous harmonic maps by minimizing a metric dispersion criterion.

Desbrun et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> compute the discrete Dirichlet energy and apply conformal parameterization to interactive geometry remeshing. Levy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> compute a quasi-conformal parameterization by approximating the Cauchy-Riemann equation using the least square method. The above two formulations are equivalent. Hormann and Greiner propose the MIPS parameterization <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, which roughly attempts to preserve the ratio of singular values over the parameterization. Degener et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> extend the method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and provide a control parameter that allows for mediation between angle and area distortion.</p><p>Conformal map for genus zero closed surfaces Haker et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> introduce a method to compute a global conformal mapping from a genus zero surface to a sphere by representing the Laplace-Beltrami operator as a linear system. Gu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> introduce a nonlinear optimization method to compute global conformal parameterizations for genus zero surfaces. The optimization is carried out in the tangential spaces of a sphere.</p><p>Conformal map for high genus surfaces Few researchers report their work on surfaces with complicated topology.

Further details can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>Conformal Chart Let U be an open set of S ∈ R 3 . A parameterization of U is a one to one map z : U → R 2 , which maps U to the (u, v) plane. (U, z) is called a chart of S. In the case of conformal chart, the first fundamental form satisfies:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ds 2 = λ (u, v) 2 (du 2 + dv 2 ), where λ (u, v)</formula><p>is called the stretch factor, a function that scales the metric at each point (u, v). The coordinate pair (u, v) is called a conformal parameter of the surface patch U. (U, z) is called a conformal chart of S.</p><p>Conformal Atlas All oriented metric surfaces are Riemann surfaces and have a global conformal atlas, or a set of conformal charts. In the following discussion, we treat R 2 as a complex plane, where the point (u, v) is equivalent to z = u + iv, and (u, −v) is equivalent toz = u − iv. In later sections, we use both representations interchangeably.</p><p>Let S be a surface in R 3 with an atlas {(U α , z α )}, where (U α , z α ) is a chart, and z α : U α → C maps an open set U α ⊂ S to the complex plane C.</p><p>The atlas is called conformal if (1). each chart (U α , z α ) is a conformal chart. Namely, on each chart, the first fundamental form can be formulated as ds <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">= λ (z α ) 2 dz α dz α , (2). the transition maps z β • z −1 α : z α (U α ∩U β ) → z β (U α ∩U β )</formula><p>are holomorphic. A chart is compatible with a given conformal atlas if adding it to the atlas again yields a conformal atlas. A conformal structure ( Riemann surface structure ) is obtained by adding all compatible charts to a conformal atlas. A Riemann surface is a surface with a conformal structure.</p><p>Holomorphic 1-form Given a Riemann surface S with a conformal atlas {(U α , z α )}, a holomorphic 1-form ω is defined by a family</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">{(U α , z α , ω α )}, such that (1) ω α = f α (z α )dz α , where f α is holomorphic on U α , and (2) if z α = φ αβ (z β ) is the coordinate transformation on U α ∩U β ( = / 0), then f α (z α ) dz α dz β = f β (z β )</formula><p>, the local representation of the differential form ω satisfies the chain rule.</p><p>For a Riemann surface S with genus g &gt; 0, all holomorphic 1forms on S form a complex g-dimensional vector space (2g real dimension), denoted as Ω 1 (S). The quality of a global conformal parameterization for a high genus surface is mainly determined by the choice of the holomorphic 1-form.</p><p>The zero points of a holomorphic 1-form ω are the points where, on any local representation (U α , z α , ω α ), ω α equals zero. For a genus g &gt; 0 surface, there are in general 2g − 2 zero points for each holomorphic 1-form.</p><p>Möbius Transformation Group For genus zero closed surfaces, there is no holomorphic one form. The global conformal parameterization is a conformal map φ : S → S 2 from the surface S to the unit sphere S 2 . Two such kinds of transformations differ by a Möbius transformation on S 2 . Suppose both φ 1 and φ 2 are two conformal parameterizations of S, consequently φ 2 • φ −1 1 = µ, where µ is a Möbius automorphism of the sphere. All conformal maps from S to S 2 can then be formulated as µ • φ 1 . We compute one conformal map φ 1 first, then compose it with a Möbius transformation µ. By choosing an appropriate µ, we can optimize the energy.</p><p>A genus zero open surface can be globally conformally parameterized by the unit disk. Two such kinds of parameterizations differ by a Möbius transformation defined on the disk. We can find the best one with a similar method to that used for a genus zero closed surface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Optimization Algorithms Overview</head><p>In order to measure the quality of a global conformal parameterization, we define different metrics for different applications. There are several main factors affecting the quality of a parameterization, including the topology of the surface, the zero point position and the choice of the holomorphic 1-form for a high genus surface or the Möbius transformation for a genus zero surface. The algorithms for optimizing these factors are as follows.</p><p>• Metric for parameterization. We formulate different functionals to measure the qualities of parameterizations, including uniformity energy, parameter area of emphasized regions and zero points locations.</p><p>• Topology Optimization. The long tube shape causes an exponential shrinking parameterization. We design a method to mediate this problem.</p><p>• Zero Point Allocation. The parameterization near the zero points is singular; it is desirable to allocate zero points at the predefined positions.</p><p>• Optimal Holomorphic 1-form. The global conformal parameterization for a higher genus surface is induced by a holomorphic 1-form. The special holomorphic 1-form is chosen to optimize the functional for parameterizations.</p><p>• Optimal Möbius Transform. The global conformal parameterization of a genus zero surface is determined by a Möbius transform. The algorithm is designed to find an optimal Möbius transform to maximize the functional.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Approximation Strategy</head><p>The concepts of Riemann surfaces are defined for smooth surfaces. In practice, it is impossible to represent the smooth surface and conformal structure using finite memory. We approximate them by the finite element method. Specifically, we approximate a smooth surface S by a series of piecewise linear triangular meshes {S n } such that eachS n doesn't have many obtuse angles and approximate the smooth conformal structures of S using piecewise linear mappings defined on {S n }. Such discrete mappings are called discrete holomorphic 1-forms. The existence of {S n } has been shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>A natural question arises of whether the approximation converges to the real conformal structure of the smooth surface. The answer is positive. Computing conformal structure is equivalent to solving an elliptic Partial Differential Equation (PDE) on the surface. It has been proven in finite element field that the discrete approximation converges to the real solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Also, the solutions to elliptic PDEs are stable and smooth in general. This implies the convergence and stability of our approximation.</p><p>Because of the convergence and the stability of our discrete approximations, they behave like the real solutions asymptotically. In the following discussion, we conceptually treat them as smooth solutions and do not differentiate discrete approximation and smooth solution.</p><p>There is another important point we want to clarify. The conformal structure is determined by the metric of the surface. Even if a surface is not smooth, such as the meshS n in the approximation, it still has a smooth metric and a smooth conformal structure. The discrete holomorphic 1-forms in the approximations are not the real conformal structure of the meshS n .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">ALGORITHMS FOR GLOBAL CONFORMAL PARAMETERI-ZATION OPTIMIZATION</head><p>In our current work, the surfaces are represented as meshes. Suppose K is a simplicial complex, and a mapping r :</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">|K| → R 3 em- beds |K| in R 3 . M = (K, r)</formula><p>is called a triangular mesh. K n , where n = 0, 1, 2, are the sets of n-simplices.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Computing Conformal Structures</head><p>We use the methods introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> to compute conformal structures.</p><p>Genus 0 closed surfaces can be conformally parameterized over a unit sphere, and harmonic maps of these surfaces are equivalent to conformal maps. We use a Gauss map as the initial map, and then we use the heat flow method to reduce the harmonic energy with special constraints. The final harmonic map is a global conformal parameterization. By composing it with a Möbius map of the sphere, we can obtain all possible global conformal parameterizations.</p><p>For genus 0 open surfaces, we use double covering to get a closed symmetric surface. We can map this double covered surface conformally to a sphere and preserve the symmetry; i.e, each copy of the original surface is mapped to a hemisphere. Then we use stereographic projection to map a hemisphere to a unit disk; the surface is globally conformally parameterized by the disk. By composing with a Möbius map of the disk, we can construct all global conformal parameterizations for the surface.</p><p>The conformal structure of a higher genus surface can be represented as a holomorphic one-form basis, which is a set of 2g functions ω i :</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">K 1 → R 2 , i = 1, 2 • • • , 2g</formula><p>. Any holomorphic one-form ω is a linear combination of these functions. The surface can be cut open to a topological disk, namely a fundamental domain. Verdiére et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and Lazarus et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> discussed the algorithms for computing fundamental domains for general surfaces. By integrating ω on a fundamental domain, the whole surface can be globally conformally mapped to the uv plane.</p><p>The computation process for {ω i , i = 1, 2, • • • , 2g} can be summarized as computing the homology basis, cohomology basis, harmonic one-form basis and holomorphic one-form basis.</p><p>Double covering techniques are applied to surfaces with boundaries to convert them to closed symmetric surfaces. Therefore, in the following discussion, we assume the surfaces are closed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Metrics for parameterization</head><p>In order to convert the whole mesh to a geometry image or spline surface patches, parameterizations with high uniformity are preferred. It is often desirable to allocate more parameter areas for special regions on the surface in real applications. For example, in surface remeshing, more samples are required for regions with high Gaussian curvature or sharp features. Sometimes, multi-chart geometry images are used to represent the shape. In this case, we can use several global parameterizations, each of which will emphasize a surface region and convert it to one chart in the geometry image. Also in this scenario, the parameterization emphasizing different regions are also desirable. For high genus surfaces, the existence of zero points is unavoidable, and the neighborhoods of zero points will be under sampled in the parameter domain. Therefore, users would like to assign the zero points to positions that have lower curvature or are less visible. In order to allocate zero points at the prescribed positions, we design a special metric to measure the parameter area of the neighborhoods of the given points. If the parameterization of zero points places them at the desired positions, this metric will be close to zero.</p><p>Suppose Ω ⊂ R 2 is the parameter domain for a surface S and (u, v) are parameters on Ω. Then the functional for measuring uniformity is</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">E = Ω (λ (u, v) 2 − 1) 2 dudv,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where λ is the conformal factor, subject to</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Ω dudv = Ω λ (u, v) 2 dudv.<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Similarly, suppose Ω is divided into two regions Ω 1 and Ω 2 , and we would like to emphasize Ω 1 . Then the functional is</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">E = Ω 1 λ (u, v) 2 dudv,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>subject to</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Ω 1 ∪Ω 2 λ (u, v) 2 dudv = Ω dudv.<label>(4)</label></formula><p>For high genus surfaces, if we want to assign zero points for a global conformal parameterization, different functionals should be formulated to minimize the conformal factor at the desired points. Suppose we want to assign {p 1 , p 2 , • • • , p n } ⊂ S as zero points, where U i ⊂ Ω is a neighborhood of p i , and ω is a holomorphic 1-form. We define the functional as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">E(ω) = n ∑ i=1 U i ω ∧ω,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>∧ represents the wedge product between holomorphic 1-forms. Intuitively, this functional measures the area of the neighborhoods of zero points on the parameter domain. If there is a holomorphic 1form ω with zero points at all p i 's, then its E(ω) should be close to zero.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Topological Optimization</head><p>In this section, we introduce an automatic method to modify the topology of the surface to improve the uniformity of the parameterization.</p><p>For long tube shapes, such as fingers and tails, the area distortion is usually very big. We want to show that the problem cannot be solved by linear combination of the holomorphic one-form bases. We have to modify the conformal structure of the surface itself; namely, we either change the Riemannian metric or modify the topology.</p><p>First, we will demonstrate the fact that the conformal factor will increase exponentially on long tube shapes. Suppose we have a long thin cylinder and we conformally parameterize it. The center of the top is mapped to the origin. If we use polar coordinates (ρ, θ ), then the conformal factor is a function dependent only on ρ because of symmetry. The Gaussian curvature K of the cylinder is zero, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">K(ρ, θ ) = 1 λ ∆ log λ = 0.<label>(11)</label></formula><p>We can deduce λ (ρ) = exp (aρ + b), where a, b are constants. No matter what kind of conformal parameterization we choose, the stretching is exponential. We have to change the topology of the surface by introducing a small boundary at the top of the cylinder, and then the conformal factor becomes constant. Based on this observation, we design our greedy topological modification algorithm as follows. First we find the most uniform conformal parameterization for current surface. Second, we locate points with extremely high conformal factors. Third, we introduce a small slice at the neighborhoods of those points. Finally, its conformal structure is recomputed. We repeat the whole process until the uniformity energy is less than some threshold.</p><p>Estimating the Conformal Factor Suppose we have obtained a global conformal parameterization induced by a holomorphic one-form ω. The conformal factor for each vertex can be estimated by the following formula: where n is the valence of vertex v. In practice, since ω vanishes at degenerated points, we compute 1 λ instead of λ . Locating the Extreme Points We locate the cluster of vertices with relatively high conformal factors, compute their center of gravity, and find the closest vertex to it. This vertex is an extreme point. Then we introduce a small slice through each extreme point, double cover the surface as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, and compute a holomorphic 1-form basis. The optimal parameterization of the current topology is computed by minimizing the uniformity energy. We repeat the whole procedure until the energy is smaller than a specified threshold or converges to a limit.</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">λ (v) = 1 n ∑ [v i ,v]∈K 1 |r(v i ) − r(v)| |ω([v i , v])| , v i , v ∈ K 0 ,<label>(12)</label></formula><p>Now we need to address the question of whether the uniformity would really be improved by this procedure. Suppose at step n, we get a surface S n . Then any global conformal parameterization for S n is also a global conformal parameterization for S n+1 , and the minimal uniformity energy of S n+1 denoted E n+1 is no greater than that of S n . The sequence {E 0 , E 1 , E n+1 , • • • } is non-increasing and will converge to a limit. In practice, if the optimal uniformity energy does not decrease too much, the procedure will terminate.</p><p>The results for topological optimization are illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure  4</ref>. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4(a)</ref>, the bunny is conformally mapped to a sphere. The conformal factors are color encoded where the red color means high conformal factor. The tips of ears are located accurately. A horse model is also processed. The feet, the mouth and the tip of ears are regions with high conformal factor. Then we introduce small boundaries to them and compute conformal structure for the modified surfaces.</p><p>Suppose a genus zero closed surface has k boundaries after topological optimization, and its double covering is of genus k − 1. The parameterization can be further optimized by the method for high genus surfaces. Although we introduce more zero points, the quality of the parameterization is improved greatly. The boundary of small slices will be mapped to an iso-parametric line in the parameter domain; no singularities are introduced along the slices. In theory, the slices can be as small as possible to avoid affecting the rendering.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>This work introduces systematic algorithms to optimize global conformal surface parameterizations. We define uniformity energy to measure the uniformity of the parameterization. We define emphasized area energy to measure the parameter area of regions of interest. We also define special functional to allocate zero points at the desired points. The problem of optimizing global conformal parameterizations is equivalent to searching for a desired Möbius transformation for genus zero surfaces and a desired holomorphic 1-form for high genus surfaces. We model global parameter optimizations as finite dimensional optimization problems, and use Newton's method to solve them. We also introduce algorithms to automatically modify the topology and allocate zero points at the specified positions to improve the quality of the global parameterization. The algorithms developed are efficient, intrinsic, practical, and versatile for different applications.</p><p>In the future, we will generalize the global conformal parameterizations to other parameterizations, such as Tuette, Stereo, Alexa parameterizations as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and intrinsic parameterizations as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The generalization will be based on geometric differential equation theories.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>with the same constraint in equation 6 .</head><label>6</label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>
