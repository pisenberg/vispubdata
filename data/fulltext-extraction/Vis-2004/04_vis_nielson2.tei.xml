				<p>We present the definition and computational algorithms for a new class of surfaces which are dual to the isosurface produced by the widely used marching cubes (MC) algorithm. These new isosurfaces have the same separating properties as the MC surfaces but they are comprised of quad patches that tend to eliminate the common negative aspect of poorly shaped triangles of the MC isosurfaces. Based upon the concept of this new dual operator, we describe a simple, but rather effective iterative scheme for producing smooth separating surfaces for binary, enumerated volumes which are often produced by segmentation algorithms. Both the dual surface algorithm and the iterative smoothing scheme are easily implemented.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The marching cubes (MC) algorithm ( see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[12]</ref> ) is a widely used technique for computing triangular mesh isosurfaces from discretely sampled volume data over rectilinear lattices.</p><p>Here we introduce the concept of a dual surface. This dual surface tends to eliminate the poorly shaped triangles often present in MC surfaces. In a nutshell, we obtain this dual surface in the following manner. First, we extend the concept of the MC surface to a patch version which eliminates the edges of the MC surface interior to voxels to obtain a surface, S, with polygon bounded patches where each vertex is included in exactly four patches. Then for each patch of S there is associated a vertex of the dual surface. The dual consists of quad patches which are connected in exactly the same manner as the connectivity of the vertices of the surface S. See <ref type="figure">Figures 1 and 2.</ref> nielson@asu.edu <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>The edges of the MC-Patch surface are in black, the vertices of the original MC surface are at the intersections of these polygon curves. The edges of the dual surface, , are in white, where each one is associated with (appears to cross) an edge of the MC-Patch surface. Every vertex of the original MC surface appears to be surrounded by a quad patch of the dual surface. The 4*-network consists of the edges of the MC-Patch surface. An example is shown in the middle image of <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. There is considerable structure to the 4*-network in that it consists of a collection of three, mutually orthogonal planar curves. Here we assume that</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">k j i , ,</formula><p>F ≠ α which guarantees that each vertex is at the intersection of exactly two of these planar polygons. Also, we assume that MC surface is without boundary so that none of its edges are in the boundary planes of the domain lattice. These are not fundamental restrictions, but simply make the discussion here simpler not having to deal with special cases.</p><p>In Section 2, we give the formal definition of the MC-Dual surface and details for computational algorithms. Section 3 contains several examples and applications of the MC-Dual surface. Applying the ideas of the MC-Dual to the MC-Dual itself leads to a new surface which has the same edge connectivity as the original MC-Patch surface. This is discussed in Section 4. The relationship of the present work to other research in the area is explained in Section 5.</p></div>

The basic strategy consists of producing fragments of the surface one voxel at a time. The triangles produced for a particular voxel depend upon the case/configuration of this voxel. These cases are determined by the relationship of the value of the field function at a lattice point and threshold value. The 256 (= 2^8) cases are grouped into a total of 23 configurations with the equivalence relationship of a rigid rotation. Representers of these equivalence classes are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>.</p><p>where each adjacent pair of indices (including cyclic pairs) indicates an edge of S. And now a simple but important observation.

Each configuration of <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> indicates the number of vertices of each configuration produces and how these are connected to the vertices of neighboring voxels. The determination of the connectivity is through the edges. Each quad patch emanating from a vertex intersects the edge as shown in the figure. This edge is connected to the vertex of the adjoining voxel whose patch intersects this common edge. An examination of this figure will reveal that it is carefully constructed so as maintain the same face connectivity of lattice points on the ambiguous faces ( see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[11]</ref> ). With two distinguished lattice points on opposing corners, we have chosen arbitrarily, but consistently, to separate these lattice points.</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">◊ S ◊ S ◊ S ◊ Figure 5.</formula><p>The configurations for the construction of the MC-Dual surface, .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S</head><p>Simple splatting algorithm for rendering a dual surface: If no post processing, requiring the topology information, is needed and if all that is required is to render the dual surface then it is possible to do a simple algorithm based upon simply visiting each edge of the lattice edges that has a sign change and render the patch associated with it. For simplicity, assume that the value of a dual vertex is the centroid of the midpoints of the edges associated with this vertex. We simply look at each of the four voxels which share this edge, determine which patch the edge lies in for this voxel and its configuration and compute (or look up) the value of its dual vertex. Having done this for all four voxels which share this edge, we simply then render the quad patch and move onto the next lattice edge with a sign change. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>, we compare the smooth shaded rendering of the MC surface with that of the MC-Dual surface. The big difference is in the specular reflection. The MC surface has many long thin triangles and these lead to abrupt changes and near discontinuities in the highlights. The MC-Dual surface tends to diminish this negative aspect of MC surfaces. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 7</ref> illustrates this same improvement, but with a different example. While it is possible to improve somewhat the smooth rendering of the MC surface by using alternative methods of computing estimates of the normal vectors (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> ) this problem of long thin triangles is really a phenomena of the uniform sampling of the field function used by the MC algorithm which is diminished by the use of the dual surface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">EXAMPLES OF MC-DUAL SURFACES</head><p>The next example illustrates a rather different aspect and application of the MC-Dual surface. Here we have an enumerated volume of size 512x512x200 where each voxel edge is approximately .02 inches. This data is typical of data resulting from the application of segmentation algorithms to scanned medical data, ( See Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[6]</ref> ). The original field function values, ijk (which played a key role in the segmentation process) are no longer relevant for isosurface or rendering computations since there is no threshold value,</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">F α , so that ( ) { } α χ &gt; ∆ ∆ ∆ = ijk foot F k k y j x i : , , .</formula><p>Without additional information or assumptions, we can obtain a rendering of this enumerated volume by displaying the separating midpoint surface. We show this surface and a zoom-in in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure  8</ref>. The midpoint surface is rather blocky, making it difficult to discern shape information. The dual is also a separating surface that makes no assumptions about the values of the field function, but, as is shown in the bottom image of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref>, is much smoother and reveals much better shape information.  The top image and middle zoom-in illustrate an enumerated volume foot χ with a midpoint surface. The MC-Dual, which is also a separating surface that tends to be smoother, is shown in the bottom image.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DUAL OF THE DUAL</head><p>In this section, we describe a specific mapping from a MC-Dual surface For this we will require that whatever quad patch is used, it must have the property that it always intersects its associated edge of the lattice. For the examples presented here, we use a quad patch comprised of two triangles. There are potentially two possible ways to triangulate a quadrilateral. We consider the projection of the quad patch boundary onto the plane perpendicular to the edge associated with the quad patch. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 9</ref>. If this planar quadrilateral is convex then either diagonal is acceptable. If it is not, then one of the points is in the triangle formed by the other three. This point is joined to its opposing point to form the diagonal. The intersection point is then computed using barycentric coordinates. Under some circumstances and modifications, it is also possible to use a bilinear quad patch, but we forego the details of this now.   An example of a Fixed-Point Shroud is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figures 12</ref>. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 13</ref>, we show results for a random initial separating surface.   In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 14</ref>, we show some results of the present method applied to segmented MRI data (see Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[6]</ref> ). Rather than use a zoom-in, we have used a down-sampled version of the actually data set so that the effects of the ν-operator are more apparent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">SUMMARY AND REMARKS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.1</head><p>Relation to Other Work in the Area In this section, we discuss how the present techniques relate to others in the literature. We first note that meshes dual to the general triangular mesh produced by the MC algorithm are really quite different than the dual meshes we have described here which are dual to the MC-Patch surfaces. This includes the methods of Ohtake and Belyaev <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14]</ref> which is motivated by the observation that a tangential surface element that is tangential to an implicit surface has a better chance to approximate it than ones that interpolate to it. They use the dual mesh of the general triangular mesh produced by the MC method and additional subdivision to gain better approximations to features</p><p>The cuberille method was first described by Herman and Liu <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref> and later Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> discussed methods for estimating normals for displaying these surfaces. The cuberille method is described in terms of voxels belonging to objects and not lattice points as we have used here, but considering the voxels with lattice points being the centers of our voxels we have an equivalent context. Within this context, the boundary surfaces of the cuberille method can be computed per voxel using the scheme indicated in <ref type="figure">Figure 15</ref>. Gaubin <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref> has noted that the resulting surfaces are not proper two-dimensional manifolds in that several quad patches can share an edge and mentions ( see Kalvin <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[8]</ref> ) the possibility of regularizing these surface to manifolds by inserting vertices and duplicating edges with a shrinking type of approach. This would be different than the table-look-up technique we have described here and could possibly be viewed as shrinking the surface fragments of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 14</ref> to those of <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>.</p><p>The edges of the cuberille produced surfaces are subsets of the edges of SurfaceNets ( see Frisken <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> ) which include one vertex per surface cube. A surface cube of this method is defined to be 8 voxel neighbors not all of the same binary value indicating inclusion of the segmented object. Vertices are joined across cube faces and a spring model is used to compute the actual final location of each vertex. Subsequently triangles join the vertices leading to surfaces that can be rendered. A related method is that of Whitaker <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16]</ref> which he describes as a "reformulation of the technique of constrained elastic surface nets" and level sets are used to estimate surfaces of minimal area.</p><p>Ju et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[7]</ref> describe their method with: "This method is an interesting hybrid of the EMC method and the SurfaceNets method. It uses the EMC method's feature vertex rule for positioning all vertices of the contour while using the SurfaceNets method to determine the connectivity of these vertices." Here, EMC refers to the method of Kobbelt et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[9]</ref>.</p><p>In some applications, for example where the rendering of the surface is the only aspect of interest, the lack of the manifold property ( of the three previously mentioned methods) may not be an important problem, but where surface intrinsic properties are needed (e. g. normals, curvature, etc. ) or where any post geometric processing of surfaces is done (simplification, multiresolution, etc.) then the manifold property is important. The separating surfaces described here have this manifold property. This comes at the expense of dealing with more than one vertex per voxel. If the configurations C6, C7, C10, C12, C13, C15, and C18 never occurred, then a much simpler approach could be taken, but these configurations do occur is most applications. We have found that typically these configurations comprise about 1.3% of all configurations C1 to C22. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 14</ref>. The top image is the midpoint separating surface for an enumerated volume which results from a segmentation algorithm ( see Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[6]</ref> ) applied to MRI data. The middle image is the MC-Dual surface of the midpoint surface and the bottom image is the dual of the Fixed-Point Shroud. We have used a down-sampled version of the original data for this example so the effects of the new method are more apparent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Additional Remark</head><p>If a configuration C16 or C19 ( see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> and <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> ) share a common ambiguous face, then we get a dual surface where two edges become coincident. The surface is still a two manifold in that no edge is shared by more that two quad patches. This can be viewed as a situation where a topological tunnel has geometrically collapsed. This phenomenon is a result of the decision to be consistent with the MC topology given in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> to always separate the opposing vertices on the ambiguous faces.</p><p>We have presented our new method as a general framework and have not been specific about certain aspects of the process. For the examples presented here, the vertices of the MC-Dual were simply taken as the centroids of the vertices of the associated patch. How to define and compute the MC-Dual vertices is a wide open research topic with the possibility of variety of new techniques based upon the application domain and/or the information that might be available (e. g. Hermite data). Incorporating the ideas of (the geometry of) surface nets into this context would be interesting. We have investigated some techniques which produce dual surfaces with certain specific Gaussian curvature characteristics and we will report on this in the near future. We are also investigating techniques that will make the ν-operator the identity operator (or nearly). That is, the vertices of the quad patches are selected so as to yield specified intersection points on the lattice edges. Also, the specific choice of the quad patch for the MC-Dual and its influence on the dualof-the-dual is an open question with choices having effects on the overall characteristics of the Fixed-Point Shroud. Here we used the simple two-triangle quad patch and alluded to the use of a bilinear patch. Patches of higher order continuity would be interesting and potentially useful. In the case where the centroid and two-triangle patch are used, it is easy to see that a new vertex of the dual-of-the-dual is a convex combinations of its star vertices. This property tends to force a number of the patches of the Fixed-Point Shroud to be degenerate with vertices at points of the lattice. Different techniques for choosing the dual vertices will, of course, lead to different results which make this whole topic rather interesting.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>◊S</head><label></label><figDesc>October 10-15, Austin, Texas, USA IEEE Visualization 2004 0-7803-8788-0/04/$20.00 ©2004 IEEE</figDesc></figure>
