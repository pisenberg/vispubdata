				<p>Most data used in the study of seafloor hydrothermal plumes consists of sonar (acoustic) scans and sensor readings. Visual data captures only a portion of the sonar data range due to the prohibitive cost and physical infeasibility of taking sufficient lighting and video equipment to such extreme depths. However, visual images are available from research dives and from the recent IMAX movie, Volcanoes of the Deep Sea. In this application paper, we apply existing lighting models with forward scattering and light attenuation to the 3D sonar data in order to mimic the visual images available. These generated images are compared to existing visual images. This can help the geoscientists understand the relationship between these different data modalities and elucidate some of the mechanisms used to capture the data.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION</head><p>Hydrothermal plumes form where hot fluids discharge from seafloor vents (commonly called black smokers) on mid-ocean spreading ridges. These hot buoyant fluids entrain the ambient seawater as they rise and are important to understanding the global transport of heat and chemicals in the ocean (which is a factor in climate studies) and to understanding the evolution of sea microbes.</p><p>Geologists, acoustical geophysicists and computational fluid dynamicists (CFD) are all involved in the study of seafloor hydrothermal plumes, and they all "see" plumes in different ways. The field geologists, in particular, are used to looking at optical photographs and videos. These are either taken directly of underwater hydrothermal plumes, where the limited visibility constrains the range and features, or are taken in the laboratory during a plume experiment. Geophysicists look at "acoustic" data, and acoustic images are significantly different from optical images. To optical tools, plumes have opaque cores, irregular but sometimes sharp edges, and slowly fading tops. Acoustic imaging sees all the way through the plume core to the other side but sees only gradational edges, because plumes are nearly transparent to transmission of acoustic waves although they do scatter them.</p><p>Additionally, traditional 3D visualization is largely threshold based so the plume appears to have a sharp top (as an artifact of the chosen threshold). Computational fluid dynamicists see plumes as mechanisms of turbulent transport; they tend to focus on the size and speed of eddies rather than properties of the mean flow. Nevertheless, computationalists are more familiar with looking at isosurfaces within plumes than geologists are because CFD model results are 3D volumes just like sonar data and, hence, visualized with the same or similar tools.</p><p>The motivation for this study is to try to create more realistic plume images from the acoustic data to help bridge the gap between these fields and help the geologists understand the acoustical geophysicists data. Our goal is to use the particle concentration implicit in the acoustic backscatter intensity to recreate the optical image a camera would see given a particular lighting level.</p><p>An additional motivation for visualizing the acoustic data as optical data (i.e., converting acoustic images to optical images) is the greater understanding of the acoustic interaction with the plume and the properties of the plume. Our Vent Imaging and Processing (VIP) group is working to determine the relative roles of different backscatter mechanisms that produce acoustic images of black smoker plumes. We have assumed that Rayleigh backscatter (scattering by particles that are small relative to the wavelength of the acoustic pulses used to ensonify a plume) is the principal mechanism. Other possible backscatter mechanisms are density discontinuities related to turbulent structure and temperature variations within the buoyant plumes. By using visualization techniques, specifically realistic lighting models <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>[8] <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>[25], we can convert the plume image from mechanical waves (sound) to electromagnetic waves (light). The acoustic data are the observed volume backscattering coefficients for Rayleigh scattering and the resulting optical images will model the Mie scattering of visible light. This will, in conjunction with other tests, help us to sort out backscattering mechanisms and their relative importance.</p><p>In the next section, we describe how sonar images of plumes are acquired. This is followed by a description of the realistic rendering techniques most relevant to this study. Results of applying the realistic rendering to the acoustical images are described in Section 3. These computed images are compared to "real" images ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>) taken from an underwater cruise <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Because the lighting techniques are general, different lighting conditions can be simulated by changing the parameters of the model. In Section 4, we apply an IMAX filming based lighting model to the acoustic data and compare these results to images from a recent IMAX film, Volcanoes of the Deep Sea <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. This film captured spectacular images of hydrothermal plume from a site in the Pacific and several sites in the Atlantic; the images shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> are from the RIDGE 2000 Integrated Study Site at 9° N on the East Pacific Rise (EPR) and the vent complex called Snakepit at 23°N on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Note the different color of the plumes, which is both a function of the materials present in the plume and the distance of the camera and lights.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">BACKGROUND</head><p>Sub-seafloor hydrothermal convection systems discharge as plumes from point sources and as seepage from areas of the ocean bottom. The plumes originate as clear, hot (c. 150 o to 400 o C) solutions that vent from mineralized chimneys, precipitate dissolved metals as particles to form black or white smokers as they turbulently mix with ambient seawater, and buoyantly rise hundreds of meters to a level of neutral density where they spread laterally. Hydrothermal flow regimes are being intensively studied for their role as quantitatively significant agents of dispersal of heat, chemicals, and biological material into the ocean from subseafloor hydrothermal convection systems on a global scale (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>).</p><p>The particles in hydrothermal plumes depend on the chemistry and temperature of the fluids exiting the seafloor. High temperature (250-350°C) fluids from black smokers ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>) are typically characterized by the precipitation of metal-rich sulfide and sulfate minerals (chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, pyrite, sphalerite) while lower temperature (70-300°C) fluids from white smokers typically precipitate amorphous silica, pyrite and barite <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Feely et al., 1987)</ref>. The exact mineral assemblage in black smoker plumes varies between regions. Precipitates in plumes along the Endeavour Segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge (e.g., Grotto Vent in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1a</ref>) are dominated by chalcopyrite and anhydrite <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Pyrrhotite is more important in some plumes along the East Pacific Rise <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Particle composition also varies vertically in the plume <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref> gives the chemical formula and some optical properties for the minerals most likely to be found in our study area (Endeavour).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Acoustic Remote Sensing</head><p>Our acoustic images of plumes are based on the intensity of Rayleigh backscatter from metallic mineral particles (sulfides, oxyhydroxides, sulfates) precipitated from high-temperature hydrothermal solutions and suspended as "smoke" in the plumes <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The particles are small (microns) relative to the wavelength of the acoustic frequencies used (~1 cm at 200 to 330 kHz). At sufficiently low particle concentrations (for no multiple scattering) backscatter intensity is directly proportional to concentration of suspended particles as the product of total particle load and a factor dependent upon average particle mechanical properties (density, bulk modulus, and radius).</p><p>The volume backscattering coefficient, which is easily and accurately computed from the raw acoustic data, plays a similar role for sound as the extinction coefficient does for light. However, Rayleigh backscattering and Mie forward scattering have different dependencies on wavelength (or wavenumber k) and particle size (radius r). In the case of Mie scattering (for both light and sound where the wavelength is much smaller than the particle), the extinction cross-section is approximately twice the actual particle's cross-sectional area <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>[12] (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> In the case of Rayleigh scattering (wavelengths much larger than the particles), the backscattering cross-section depends on the fourth power of the ratio between particle size and wavelength <ref type="bibr">[</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> In this study, the sonar is operating at a frequency of 200 kHz and the particles are approximately 500 µm. The extinction scale factor λ, which is the ratio of the Mie extinction cross-section and the Rayleigh backscattering cross-section, used in the opacity   transfer function (described in Section 3.1.2) is estimated as 1.79x10 4 -5.72x10 5 based on the wavelength of the sonar's transmitted pulse (0.75 cm) and a range of particle sizes of 500-1000 µm (very limited data is available and the methodologies of particle size measurement are suspect).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Sonar Image Acquisition</head><p>The sonar data used in this study were obtained as part of the Vent Imaging Pacific 2000 (VIP 2000) cruise during which several types of sonar observations were made within the Main Endeavour Field on the Juan de Fuca Ridge <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3</ref>). In this recent experiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>[21], a sonar system (Kongberg Simrad Mesotech SM 2000) operating at 200 kHz and mounted on the tethered remotely operated vehicle ROV JASON, operated by the Deep Submergence Group of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, was used to acquire acoustic datasets. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows three-dimensional images of plume structure using direct visualization techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The 3D images are formed by means of a combination of time gating (for resolution in range), digital beam forming (for resolution in azimuth), and mechanical scanning (for resolution in elevation). Range resolution is between 0.2 m and 2.0 m depending upon the transmitted waveform and the width of the window used for averaging in the sonar time series. Azimuthal and elevation resolution are both equal to the sonar beamwidth (1.4° between half-maximum-power points). The system scans a plume in 2 minutes and is calibrated to record absolute backscatter intensity.</p><p>The sonar data were acquired with ROV JASON stationary on the West wall of the Endeavour segment near the Grotto vent complex ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>). Video observations show that the Grotto plume is produced by coalescence of at least five vents within a 3 m x 3 m area. The several smaller plumes issuing near the summit of Grotto are estimated to have coalesced at a height of about 4-5 m. A significantly lower height of coalescence would have been observable in the video imagery and a significantly higher height would have allowed resolution of separate plumes by the sonar. Owing to sidelobe interference by the Grotto edifice, the sonar could not image plume structure for heights less than 5 m. It is important to note that the acoustic images and the camera stills ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>) come from different regions of the plume.</p><p>The results of conventional visualization methods, such as isosurfaces and basic raytracing, tend to have edges that are too solid and omit entirely any less intense peripheral areas that indicate which way the plume is drifting or how the particles are dispersing as the plume mixes with the surrounding water. Examples of this are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. While these images are understandable to most visualization scientists, geologists do not tend to think in thresholds and prefer to see images that resemble photographs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Realistic Lighting Models</head><p>Methods for realistically rendering of translucent objects, have been, and continue to be, a popular focus for research in the scientific visualization community <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The lighting model that most significantly influenced our implementation was the particle-sensitive scattering model proposed in Riley et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. In that model, Riley et al. expands upon the scattering model introduced in Nishita et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> by allowing the optical properties such as the extinction coefficients and phase function for scattering to vary through the dataset. It also incorporates the approximations for highly dominant forward scattering described in Kniss et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, but without the chromatic absorption term from that work.</p><p>Most of the work listed above deals with rendering realistic images of clouds. Realistic plume visualization is in many ways parallel to the realistic visualization of clouds and weather data. Like clouds, plumes are made up of small, suspended particles and their particle densities can vary greatly within the structure. Also, while most plumes have a much lower albedo than clouds, their appearance is still significantly affected by the strong forward scattering effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. However, water as a medium has non-negligible opacity and strongly chromatic attenuation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">PLUME APPLICATION</head><p>Although the sonar data only provides a measurement of the volume scattering coefficient throughout the volume, this result can be correlated with the particle density (or particle concentration to a geologist) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. By applying the known properties of seawater, suspended particles, and the minerals found in plumes, the particle density can be used to calculate reasonable values for the volume's various optical properties. For convenience and ease of calculation, we then perform the rendering in two phases (similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>), the first of which is a preprocessing step in which the light propagation through the volume is calculated for each individual light source. The second phase is a direct volume rendering process in which we can incorporate the light contributions from any combination of the preprocessed lights and vary the viewing angle.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>, and a list of constants and their values is provided in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>.</p><p>The scattering phase function determines what percentage of the colliding light will scatter and in what direction. Since at least 90% of scattering from particles with a radius much larger than the wavelength of the incident light (500 µm compared with 0.5 µm) occurs within 5° arc, we approximate the scattering phase as two cumulative constants, described in 3.1.2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>Reflective color and chromatic absorption determine the color of the final image. The reflective color used for the plume particles is based on data available from reference resources (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>) on the reflective color of minerals identified as suspended particles in the plume. Chromatic absorption accounts for the wavelength dependence of light attenuation in water. The extinction constants used here are taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, using the values at wavelengths of 680 nm, 540 nm, and 470 nm for red, green, and blue, respectively. Most of the available data of this type is based on pure water, but the properties of seawater are shown to be very similar <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Chromatic extinction in the medium can be calculated with a standard extinction equation for each color channel, as discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Opacity is also calculated with a standard extinction equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The sonar data provide information about the scattering cross-section of the particles in the plume under study. This feature is strongly related to the extinction, as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Light Propagation</head><p>The lighting and rendering model is similar to that presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and summarized by the equation for the intensity at each pixel location: This forward scattering effect is implemented using the conical sampling region and integrated phase function described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. A cone, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>, is projected from the sampling point towards the light source. A single central sample and several peripheral samples of the light intensity are taken. The central sample is used to calculate the intensity contributions from direct light and light that was forward scattered within an angle of θ/4. The peripheral samples are averaged and the result is used to estimate the intensity contribution from light that scattered at an angle between θ/4 and θ/2. Since the scattering percentage is being calculated for regions instead of single points, the scattering phase function is integrated over each of the two regions and the resulting constants are used in the implementation. For this application, eight peripheral samples were used instead of four, Particle radius kr Product of wave number and particle radius    <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. The photograph has a smaller field of view than the acoustic image, but appears to have a similar one due to the inherent self-similarity of plumes. The photograph shows an approximately 0.5 m field of view; the acoustic data set is 60 m wide but starts ~3m below the vent. The camera and lighting position during the cruise is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 6a</ref> and are at approximately the same position in front of the plume. The parameters for this scenario are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref>. The image in <ref type="figure">Figure 9a</ref> is quite dark because the cruise lighting is very low and the modeled camera is at the sonar position (~20 m from plume) rather than the camera position of the video stills (~5 m from plume).</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) bg l 0 4 L T 0 , L T , C P L , d d w w w s w s s s π ψ = + ⎡ ⎤ Ω Ω Ω ⎣ ⎦ ∫ ∫ r r r r r r r r (3) ( ) T , s</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">IMAX Conditions</head><p>The recent IMAX film, Volcanoes of the Deep Sea <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, filmed some magnificent images of hydrothermal vents in both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Stills from the movie are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1b</ref>-c above; these particular images are of a vent at 9°N EPR in the Pacific Ocean and of a vent at Snakepit on the MAR in the Atlantic Ocean. The IMAX lighting setup can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 6b</ref>. An array of 3-8 lights shine directly on the plume. During filming different submersibles were used to capture different lighting and camera positions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1b</ref> is an image with front lighting. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 7b</ref>, an acoustic data set is rendered with IMAX 3 lighting conditions including a big spotlight, whiter light, and more total lights (note, the acoustic data is from a different site then the IMAX film). Notice how much more brightly the plume is illuminated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 7b</ref> compared to <ref type="figure">Figure 9a</ref>, although very little more of the plume is visible. The billowing effect of eddies is also more noticeable in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 7b</ref> than in <ref type="figure">Figure 9a</ref>. The distinct identity of the plume from the surrounding water is apparent in the lighting rendering of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 7b</ref> but not in the standard rendering in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 7a</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> shows a lighting panorama (a sequence of images forming a panorama) created by positioning the spotlight at five locations along a 90 degree arc around the front of the plume. The lighting position is static. Note how this type of image would be very difficult to take underwater, as two different vehicles would be necessary (one for the light, one for the camera). An animation showing this effect can be seen at <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION</head><p>Part of the motivation for reproducing the acoustic data as lighting panoramas is that the video images of plumes cover a very small area; even the better cameras and the stronger lights of the IMAX setup produced only 2 m by 6 m images (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1)</ref>. The much larger dimensions of the acoustic data (100 m x 60 m x 55 m) offer the potential to see so much more of the plume. However, the standard volume rendering techniques are threshold based producing isosurfaces or ray-tracings with color and opacity as direct thresholds. The lighting techniques describe in Section 3 allow use of a more sophisticated transfer function and inclusion of the effects of shadowing and scattering.</p><p>Comparison of the generated images and the video images must take into account the fact that the plume gets thinner and more wispy as it rises (this is starting to occur at the top of the IMAX images in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>) because of the dilution of the particle density with entrainment of seawater. Otherwise, the plume structure is self-similar in that the size relation of the eddies to the diameter of the plume is constant over most of the 100-300 m of rise in the buoyant plume and the dynamic processes of turbulence and entrainment are relatively constant over the buoyant rise. That said, the rest of this section compares the video and generated   images, discusses their differences and suggests techniques for future improvements. <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> shows three images that compare the effect of changing the lighting setup (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref>) while the extinction factor, camera location, and albedo are held constant. The generated images using the cruise lighting setup have a similar blue color to the cruise video images. The blue color is due to the absorption of red, and to a lesser extent green light, by the water. The generated image shows less detailed eddies, although it does show some indications of eddy shape and size. The lack of fine detail in the cruise-setup images is due to the coarse resolution of the acoustic data -it is difficult to produce cm scale features with m scale data. The plume in the cruise-setup images also appears less opaque. This may just be a result of the increased dilution of the plume with height (and concurrently expanding width). As stated in Section 4.1, the generated image is very dark which is consistent with our inability to see the plume during acoustic data acquisition. This is part of the utility in generating images from the acoustic data: the plume becomes more visible as more lights are added (see <ref type="figure">Figure 9b-c)</ref>. We anticipate further exploitation of this effect to show geologists what the plumes would look like if they could always have IMAX like lighting (which is prohibitive because of the high power requirements and cost of the lights).</p><p>The generated images using the IMAX 3 and IMAX 5 lighting setups are brighter (and even brighter) with slightly less blue tones than the cruise-setup images corresponding to the slightly reduced blue tones in the IMAX video still <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1b)</ref> compared to the cruise video image <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1a)</ref>. The lack of blue in the second IMAX still <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1c)</ref> relates to the close proximity of the camera to the plume; the scope is the same because several stills were combined in a mosaic.</p><p>The IMAX-setup image shows more detailed eddies than the cruise-setup image, although not as much detail as the video images. The lack of fine detail in the generated images is due to the coarse resolution of the acoustic data. The apparent increase in detail between the cruise and IMAX setups is likely just better illumination, which clarifies the details that are there. The plume in the IMAX-setup images appears more opaque than in the cruise-setup images, which is probably related to the greater amount of light reflected back; there was no change in the actual opacities. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> shows a panoramic sequence of views of the plume with the camera moving from 45° right of the light source to 45° left of the light source and also an image from behind the plume. The lighting panorama shows the three-dimensional structure of the plume and its eddies. The opacity of the plume core is very clear and slight bending of the plume due to currents can also be seen (especially at later times <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> shows a sequence of generated images using different values of the extinction scale factor (see Sections 2.1 and 3.1.2). Because there are few samples of particles from the buoyant stem of hydrothermal plumes, we can only estimate the value of the extinction scale factor, which depends on particle size (because the Rayleigh scattering cross-section is a function of particle size). This series of images ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>) shows that the brightness and apparent width of the plume in the generated images increases as the extinction scale factor increases and assumed particle size decreases. The change in the apparent width of the plume results from the background and edges of the plume becoming more visible as increasing the extinction scale factor shifts the opacity transfer function towards lower data values. The background values in the acoustic data reflect noise in the sonar system.</p><p>Comparison of the generated images with the cruise and IMAX video stills suggests that a particle size of 1000 µm leads to the closest match with the generated images. This is larger than the particle sizes observed (10-500 µm) but the particle sizes were obtained by using a vacumm pump to filter water samples through a fine mesh (&lt;10 µm openings), which is known to disturb clumps (aggregations) of particles. In future at sea experiments, we plan to use modern instruments based on lasers to determine the actual particle size distributions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> shows a sequence of images, which vary the albedo (reflectivity) assigned to the average particle modeled - <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref> shows that the true albedo is a function of the particle chemical composition. Thus the differences in the series of generated  <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> rendered using IMAX 5 lighting conditions (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>). Notice that the plume now has a distinct identity from the surrounding water. The eddy shapes are also somewhat more apparent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>b) a)</head><p>images reflect our assumptions about the average particle composition. As stated in Section 2, the plumes on the Endeavour Segment (where Grotto Vent imaged here is located) are typically dominated by chalcopyrite and anhydrite <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, which have a low albedo (&lt;0.3). However, the generated image most consistent with the video stills suggests that the Grotto Vent plume may actually be dominated by pyrite, which has the highest albedo (~0.5); this is chemically plausible for high temperature vents <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Future improvements include exploring the parameters that effect opacity and color and adding additional scattering mechanisms. We have used the best possible choices for transfer functions from acoustic backscatter to extinction coefficient based on available data (see Section 3.1), but have not conducted a systematic survey of the effects of varying the parameters (sensitivity analysis). We intend to explore the controls on the apparent opacity and color of the plume by changing the reflective color and opacity properties of the particles in conjunction with the multiple hypotheses in the literature concerning particle composition <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. We would also like to add the effects of other scattering mechanisms and sub-eddy-scale details based on turbulence models <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. We plan to explore other existing acoustic data (including some closer to the EPR IMAX video) with this methodology.</p><p>This study shows that lighting models can be used to generate realistic optical images from acoustic data. This will improve understanding of seafloor hydrothermal plumes by clarifying the geologic interpretation of the acoustic data. In addition, changing the number of lights can be used to mimic the effect of different lighting conditions <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 11)</ref>. Thus, the lighting model is effective and our future studies varying optical properties will address the relative importance of different types of particles in the plume's appearance. <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. This sequence shows the effect of changing the numbers and locations of lights in the lighting model (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref> for the exact positions). (a) The cruise lighting setup has 2 lights close to the camera. The plume is very hard to see consistent with the observation that during the acquisition of the acoustic data, it was not possible to see the plume at all. (b) The IMAX 3 lighting set up has 3 lights, two of which are farther from the camera. The plume is brighter with more light and some internal shadows are visible. (c) The IMAX 5 lighting setup has 5 lights and hence the plume is much more visible. Internal shadows make the eddies very visible in this image. a) c) b) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>. Lighting panorama of the acoustic data using the IMAX 5 setup. Viewing angles from left to right are -45°, 0°, 45° and 180°. The 180° view shows the glow of the lights around the edges of the opaque plume. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref>. This sequence shows the variation in the generated images with the assumed albedo based on the chemical composition of the particles. The albedo varies left to right as 0.3 (chalcopyrite dominates), 0.5 (pyrite dominates), and 0.7. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>.
