<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The digitization age changed strategies and methods to gain knowledge in the humanities essentially. In terms of philology, humanities approaches were traditionally oriented primarily on language and text. As retrieval strategies in printed encyclopedias were mostly based on the alphabetical order of contained names, the now available access to large relational databases provides the opportunity for humanities scholars to filter groups of entities not only based on names, but also on various other data facets. But the pure access to a database containing a multitude of information also reveals limitations when it comes to investigating concrete research questions beyond only showing lists of entries that match a given database query. Especially for humanities scholars who are not used to exploit the cardinality of query languages, it becomes hard to navigate large databases and filter results accordingly <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Also, with experiences of the so-called visualistic turn <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> in the early 1990's, humanities scholars more and more wished to explore complex issues not only based on texts, but also based on images. An example of this process is given by the Bavarian Musicians Encyclopedia Online (German: "Bayerisches Musiker-Lexikon Online (BMLO)") <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, a powerful web-based interface for musicologists, as it provides access to information about around 30,000 musicians, extracted from various digitized printed media. Being an invaluable tool in the daily work of musicologists, this innovative access to music history heritage raised new research questions in musicology. Besides the visualization of a musician's profile and profile comparison, the major desire was the ability to find similar musicians based upon the attributes of a musician of interest, in short: profiling.</p><p>In order to develop a valuable visual analytics system capable of determining similar musicians interactively, we closely collaborated with those musicologists who originally raised the profiling research question. Initially, we discussed possible profiling tasks and various aspects of how the musicologists imagined profiling workflows. We transformed the provided data for profiling purposes, mapped required musicians' attributes to visual features, and defined similarity measures to be used as the basis for profiling similar musicians. In summary, our contributions to the visualization community are: • The similarity of person attributes: For various attributes of musicians, we designed similarity measures in accordance to musicological conceptions.</p><p>• Profiling system: Based upon eight similarity measures and a semi-automatic weighting of attribute dimensions, we designed a visual analytics system that is used by musicologists to iteratively search for musicians similar to a musician of interest.</p><p>• Column Explorer: For the comparison of temporal and textual metadata of musicians, we provide a column based representation that borrows ideas from Jigsaw's list view and Parallel Tag Clouds in order to explore correlations among various attributes.</p><p>• Temporal uncertainty: We consider existent temporal uncertainties when fixing a musician's activity time and provide a design that communicates these uncertainties to the musicologists.</p><p>We emphasize the utility of our visual analytics profiling system for musicologists by providing various usage scenarios. In a storytelling style, each scenario exemplifies how the profiling system can be used to discover unexpected insights. Additionally, we report experiences gained during our digital humanities project. This includes the iterative evaluation of our profiling system with musicologists, limitations due to the nature of humanities data and future prospects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Our work on a profiling system for musicians is related to three different aspects of research. As the usual method of profiling is based upon similarities to a given subject, we first take a look at recommendation systems, where recommendations are determined in dependency on an object of interest. The second paragraph lists visual analytics and information visualization papers that (1) are motivated by similar research questions to ours without a digital humanities background, or (2) present similar visualization techniques to the ones our profiling system is composed of. Finally, we illustrate related visualizations motivated from research questions in digital humanities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Recommendation Systems</head><p>Tapestry, the first recommender system developed in 1992, was based on collaborative filtering <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The system aggregates recommendations provided by users, and directs them to appropriate recipients. In the last two decades, many different recommendation algorithms have been developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Basically, the initial step of our profiling approach imitates recommendation based on item similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. In our case, the item is a musician, and the system determines similar musicians as recommendations. The further profiling steps of our systems are rather comparable to content-based recommendation systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. An item is recommended based upon description and the "profile of the user's interests", which are user-defined similarity weights and mandatory musician attributes in our case. The benefit of using weights to reflect the importance of certain attributes for users has already been shown for discovering related movies <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Other application areas include the development of recommender systems for YouTube videos <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, music files <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, or related people in social networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The recommendation of social media data proposed by Guy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> is based on relationship information among people. Our system uses this idea and determines a relationship similarity between musicians.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Related Visual Analytics &amp; InfoVis Techniques</head><p>The visualization of relational, geospatial, temporal and nominal textual data is a common task for researchers in visual analytics and information visualization. In accordance to the features of our profiling system, we outline the most related works under various aspects.</p><p>Visualizing recommendations Many works provide visualizations for recommendations of different type. Choo et al. present a recommendation system for a vast collection of academic papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Recommended documents can be explored in a scatterplot. Overview is a system that also supports the systematic analysis of large document collections to be used by investigative journalists <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Documents are hierarchically clustered based on content similarity, thus, can be recommended during investigation. A recommendation of notes from past analysis tasks when operating a visual analytics system is explained by Shrinivasan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. For the visualization of recommended movies, Vlachos uses a radial layout <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. Gansner offers geographic maps that use the metaphor of neighborhoods and clusters to group related recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. The latter approach communicates relations among recommendations. That a recommendation system is not seen as a black box from the user's point of view <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, we provide visual and textual cues for the collaborating musicologists to explain the existence of a recommendation.</p><p>Social network visualizations In our profiling system, relationship graphs visualize the social networks of musicians under inspection. Especially interesting are unknown musicians that connect unacquainted musicians. Applied to the relationships of characters in literary works, Euler diagrams can be used to visualize groups of social networks in clusters while also showing relations among clusters <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Weaver embeds an attribute relationship graph in his visual analytics environment to visualize the relationships between movie actors <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. Quite often, visualizations attend to the matter of visualizing large social networks and their navigation by various interaction means <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. The design of such visualizations is especially important for the exploration of online social networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multiple views</head><p>Our system consists of multiple views that visualize the musician's metadata information, e.g., we provide visual representations of temporal, geospatial, and nominal textual data. The multiple views concept is often used to communicate various data aspects. An overview of various visual analytics approaches to dynamically explore spatio-temporal data with the help of maps and timelines is given by Andrienko et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The purpose of such visual analytics environments ranges from the analysis of crime incidents <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> to the extraction and characterization of significant places from mobility data <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the visualization of semantic web data <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and the comparative analysis of geospatial-temporal data <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Also popular is the additional visualization of contextual keywords -next to map and timeline -in the form of tag clouds, for instance, to visualize topical metadata <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> or to support the discovery of meaningful events in news and social media data <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Many approaches are based on textual data sources. The cross-filtered views for multidimensional data sets as proposed by Weaver include various interfaces to be used as filters to determine potentially interesting events in newspaper article collections <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. Heimerl et al.'s visual analytics system is also composed of many views with the purpose of interactively training classifiers to be used for document retrieval on large text collections <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</p><p>Layered Textual Metadata One of the major components of our system is the Column Explorer (see Section 5.2) with a column per data facet showing textual attributes of musicians. Jigsaw's list view <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> provides the basic idea for such a visualization. The user can select an arbitrary entry and correlations to other attributes are shown. Related data entries in adjacent columns are linked. Similarly, this is done in Parallel Tag Clouds <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Each column lists tags of a certain time slice, and equal tags are linked on selection. PivotPaths is a yet similar approach to ours <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. After selecting a research paper, links are drawn to related authors and paper keywords. The related attributes in our Column Explorer are connected with colored streams. Often, streams express a temporal evolution of events <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. Tags at certain positions in streams can be used to illustrate contextual information <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Visualizations for the Digital Humanities</head><p>The database of our visual profiling approach is based upon the textual contents of numerous digitized documents about music history. Many visualization techniques with a motivation from the humanities also provide abstract views on digital text editions. Most often, the focus of interest is a specific literary text.</p><p>Keim et al. present fingerprint matrices that visualize extracted features, which characterize a given text <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. The purpose is to support the analysis of the behavior of feature values across the text. Another approach concerns the visualization of poem features. Proposed by Abdul-Rahman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, the Poem Viewer uses visual attributes to encode phonetic units as well as phonetic and semantic relationships. VarifocalReader facilitates the work with individual, potentially large digital texts by providing visualizations on various text hierarchy levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>: an overview of the text structure, tag cloud summaries, and a close reading view. Applied machine learning techniques and search mechanisms support the user to extract entities, concepts and other artifacts from the examined text. Correll et al. provide a text analysis environment for a whole corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. It aims to allow the detection of corpus-wide statistical patterns, and texts can be displayed the way that text passages reflect the relevance according to the user's preferences. Vuillemot et al. provide a flexible system for the dynamic exploration of a single literary text <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>: The Making of Americans by Gertrude Stein. Various interfaces like tag clouds and self-organizing graphs support to review vocabulary, to filter by part of speech, and to explore character networks. In GeneaQuilts <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, the genealogy of extracted characters from a literary text such as the Bible are visualized.</p><p>The purpose of our work is to visualize the similarity between musicians. Some related works on issues in literary criticism visualize the similarity between various text passages. The Word Tree shows all sentences of a given text that share the same beginning in the form of a tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. Other approaches highlight differences and similarities among various editions of a text, e.g., various German translations of Shakespeare's Othello <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> or various English translations of the Bible <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">DIGITAL HUMANITIES BACKGROUND</head><p>This research bears on musicology, a field of the humanities that observes musicians and their achievements. This includes not only composers, although a composition is seen as the fruit of a musical process. Moreover, many other musical professions are in the focus of interest of musicological research, e.g., instrument makers, conductors, singers, instrumentalists, music publishers, etc.</p><p>Motivation The Bavarian Musicians Encyclopedia Online (BMLO) project was initiated in 2004 with the goal to create a database that combines a multitude of biographical information about musicians of various professions. In cooperation with the Bavarian State Library and the Society for Bavarian Music History, musicologists of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich searched, collected and digitized related documents on music history. They combined biographical information about musicians extracted from various sources such as encyclopedias, periodicals, and series concerning musicology as well as research papers from musicology, history and science of art. A web-based platform <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> provides access to the database, which contains musicians who are part of the Bavarian music history; musicians with an active lifetime period living in Bavaria as well as musicians with a considerable influence on the Bavarian music history are included. Despite the prior focus on Bavaria, the BMLO is a valuable tool for many musicologists as it provides information about 28,137 musicians from all musical eras, spanning a time range from 4AD to the present. Working with the BMLO, the main interests are not examinations of the musicians' achievements -musicologists rather explore the features of musical professions or analyze the biographies of musicians. This includes generic research questions concerning the geographical or temporal evolution of musical professions as well as precise research questions that focus on an individual musician. One such research question -the profiling of musicians with similar careers to a musician of interest -is interesting for musicologists for a long time. Traditionally approaching an answer to this type of question, musicologists solely refer to musicological editions and monographs. But musicology primarily focuses on fifty musicians -mostly composers -and their main works. Due to this inhomogeneous state of research (what we call the popularity of musicians), a traditional similarity analysis usually starts and ends within this limited set of musicians. Although the BMLO provides an immense diversity of information about a large number of musicians, the profiling of musicians is not supported. Maybe the database could be used to address some research questions, but for musicologists complex database queries are hard to formulate <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and the musicians' attributes in the query result are hard to analyze and to compare. Therefore, musicologists desired a system that allows to approach a profiling task interactively with the aid of visual interfaces that pictorially illustrate the provided information.</p><p>Digital Humanities Project In close collaboration with musicologists using the BMLO, we developed a visual analytics system that supports the profiling of similar musicians based on a selected musician of interest. For the implementation of this project, we adopted several suggestions made by Munzner <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> to ensure designing a beneficial, powerful tool that supports answering the posed research questions. We furthermore took collaboration experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> from other visualization researchers who worked together with humanities scholars into account to avoid typical pitfalls of such interdisciplinary projects. Additionally, we worked through related works in the digital humanities, which provide valuable suggestions and guidelines for designing interfaces for humanities scholars, e.g., outlined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. To avoid making assumptions for the design of a profiling system that is hard to comprehend and does not solve the concerned musicological research questions, we initially discussed the needs of the musicologists, their workflows and challenges in the targeted domain in several meetings. Furthermore, we presented and discussed related visualization techniques to convey an impression of the capabilities and challenges within our research field. The musicologists explained how they use the BMLO for their workflows and communicated their fascination about this unique type of encyclopedia invaluable for their daily work. This get together turned out to be important to understand each others mindsets. A major outcome was a set of research questions on the profiling of musicians and the analysis of musician profiles.</p><p>Project Data The provided database and aspects of data transformation were also discussed with the musicologists. This included occurring data anomalies, the conversion of the temporal metadata to a uniform scheme while considering occurring uncertainties as well as defining popularity values by counting a musician's references. In discussions about the provided musician attributes we could separate attributes worth to integrate into the profiling process -a musician's sex, lifetime data, places of activity, musical and further professions, relationships, divisions and denomination -from irrelevant ones. For instance, the potentially interesting attribute nationality is only provided for 416 musicians (1.5%) as most musicians lived in a time when the assignment of a nationality to a person did not exist. Therefore, we decided to exclude nationalities from the profiling process. The musicologists argued that most research interests concern musicians without nationality attributes. We also asked for the relevance of each attribute dimension for a profiling task and the comparative analysis of musicians in order to push the development of the profiling system the way that predominant attributes receive more attention. Additionally, we gained information how musicologists imagined to operate with the musicians' attributes. For example, they wanted to see how attributes of different facets correlate, and they wanted to detect the links between unrelated musicians.</p><p>Project Challenges To solve the profiling task, we faced two main challenges. On the basis of relevant musician attributes, we first needed to define various similarity measures that determine the similarity of musicians (see Section 4). Second, we needed to design visual interfaces that communicate these similarities intuitively. In preparation, we looked at related visualizations and collected possible representations to map relevant attributes of musicians to visual attributes. In meetings with the musicologists, we argued on opportunities and drawbacks when applying various visualization techniques. The resultant visualization design is explained in Section 5. Finally, various usage scenarios illustrate the utility of the profiling system for the collaborating musicologists (see Section 6), now capable of detecting similar musicians without the bias of popularity. As further demands included the visual exploration of individual musician profiles and the comparative analysis of multiple profiles, we also provide an example besides profiling. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">THE SIMILARITY OF MUSICIANS</head><p>Based on various biographical information, the similarity S(m i , m j ) between the musician of interest m i and a similarity candidate m j is determined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">S(m i , m j ) = w p • P(m j ) + 8 ∑ k=1 w k • S k .</formula><p>w k is a weight for the relevance of the corresponding similarity S k . To mimic the traditional profiling approach by referring to musicological editions and monographs, we insert the popularity P(m j ) of m j as a further component into the similarity equation. The collaborating musicologists define P(m j ) in dependency on the number of publications (articles, editions and media) from and about m j . Thus, the popularity reflects the current state of research on a musician. According to this heuristic, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is the most popular musician with around 150,000 publications. Taking the musicologists' suggestions into account, we group all musicians with the same number of publications into groups g 1 ,...,g n sorted by ascending publication count. The popularity P(m j ) is then defined in dependency on m j 's popularity group g k as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P(m j ) = k n .</formula><p>w p can be used to adjust the influence of popularity during the profiling process. Using w p = 0 disregards popularities and w p = 1 mimics the traditional profiling approach. All weight values are defined interactively during the profiling process. In the following, we outline the calculation for each of the eight contributing similarities. Some of the similarity measures are defined by the Jaccard index like</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">S i (m i , m j ) = J f (m i ), f (m j ) = | f (m i ) ∩ f (m j )| | f (m i ) ∪ f (m j )| .</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Sex Similarity S sex 1</head><p>For some research questions of the collaborating musicologists, the sex of a musician plays an important role when determining similar musicians. Such an information in the form of male or female is provided for nearly all musicians (27,403= 97.4%). If the sexes of m i and m j are equal, we define S sex 1 (m i , m j ) = 1. For unequal sexes or if the sex of one musician is unknown, we use S sex 1 (m i , m j ) = 0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Activity Time Similarity S tem 2</head><p>The activity time of a musician is defined in dependency on the temporal metadata provided for nearly all musicians of the database (27,681 = 98.4%). Three various datings may be given for a musician: a dating of birth B (provided for 27,357 musicians= 97.2%), a first mentioned dating F (25,592= 91%), and/or a dating of death D (18,610 = 66.1%) The musicologists exploited the underlying textual sources of the database the way that the first mentioned dating is always an evidence for an active phase of a musician, thus, always ranges between birth and death. The granularity of the given datings ranges from date to year. Due to uncertain information in the textual sources, the given datings are often imprecise. Three types of uncertainty occur: before datings (e.g., before 1745), around datings (e.g., around March, 1745), and after datings (e.g., after <ref type="bibr">September 22, 1745)</ref>.</p><p>In order to process uncertain datings for the purpose of defining and visualizing the activity time for each musician, the collaborating musicologists provided a taxonomy -based on state-of-the-art knowledge in musicology -to map uncertainties to years as approximate datings. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref> lists how various uncertain datings are resolved in dependency on centuries. For all before and after datings we add or subtract the given difference value. For datings with an around uncertainty, we subtract the difference value for births, add the difference for deaths, and for first mentioned datings we define F min by subtracting and F max by adding the difference value. In few cases, irregularities occur after resolving uncertain datings. In case of F min &lt; B (or F &lt; B) we set  purpose, we define the two measures Political Distance D pol and Geographical Distance D geo .</p><p>Political Distance D pol The (contemporary) political distance D pol (p 1 , p 2 ) between two places p 1 and p 2 is defined in dependency on hierarchical place identifiers provided for each place. The level of detail of such an identifier varies from one (only continent) to seven. Examples are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>. For most places, at least five hierarchy levels are given. Therefore, we define D pol (p 1 , p 2 ) dependent on k first equal hierarchy levels as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">D pol (p 1 , p 2 ) = k 5 .</formula><p>Geographical Distance D geo To determine the geographical distance D geo (p 1 , p 2 ) between two places p 1 = {x 1 , y 1 } and p 2 = {x 2 , y 2 } in kilometers, we use the great circle distance G, taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">G = 6378 • arccos sin(y 1 ) • sin(y 2 ) + cos(y 1 ) • cos(y 2 ) • cos(x 1 − x 2 ) . D geo (p 1 , p 2 ) is then defined as D geo (p 1 , p 2 ) = d max − G d max .</formula><p>Specified by the musicologists, d max is the maximum distance allowed for two places to be geographically related in former times. For the examples in this paper, we used d max = 500km -empirically determined by the musicologists. In case of G &gt; d max , we define D geo = 0. Given two sets P i and P j of places of activity for m i and m j , we use the iterative closest point algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> to calculate the activity region similarity S reg 3 (m i , m j ). For each place p k i in P i , we determine the distance d(p k i ) to the "closest place" in P j , which we define as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">d(p k i ) = max p l j ∈P j D pol (p k i , p l j ) • D geo (p k i , p l j ) .</formula><p>Likewise, we determine the distance d(p l j ) to the "closest place" in P i for each place </p><formula xml:id="formula_6">p j ∈ P j . Finally, S reg 3 (m i , m j ) is defined as S reg 3 (m i , m j ) = ∑ |P i | k=0 d(p k i ) + ∑ |P j | l=0 d(p l j ) |P i | + |P j | .</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Further Profession Similarity S pro 5</head><p>The database also provides information about professions unrelated to music (e.g., philosopher, teacher, soldier) for 7,920 musicians (28.1%). As above, the Jaccard index is used to determine the similarity S   <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>). The distance between two related musicians m k and m l is defined in dependency on the relationship strength s rel (m k , m l ) as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">d(m k , m l ) = 1 s rel (m k , m l )</formula><p>.</p><p>Taking all relationships of the database into account, the relational similarity S rel 6 (m i , m j ) of m i and m j is derived from the shortest path p(m i , m j ) = {m i ,...,m j } connecting both musicians in the social network graph and its length |p(m i , m j )|, determined using Dijkstra's algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">S rel 6 (m i , m j ) = |p(m i ,m j )|−1 ∑ k=0 1 k + 1 • d(p[k], p[k + 1]).</formula><p>Thus, the similarity between acquainted musicians is S rel 6 (m i , m j ) = s rel (m i , m j ) and the similarity for musicians unconnected in the graph is S rel 6 (m i , m j ) = 0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.7">Division Similarity S div 7</head><p>Further important characteristics are the divisions where musicians worked (e.g., court, theater). These information are given for 17,062 musicians (60.6%). We determine the similarity S div 7 (m i , m j ) between the known divisions div(m i ) and div(m j ) of the musicians m i and m j using the Jaccard index: S div 7 (m i , m j ) = J div(m i ), div(m j ) . In case of unknown divisions |div(m i )| = |div(m j )| = 0, we define S div 7 (m i , m j ) = 0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.8">Denomination Similarity S den 8</head><p>Especially in former times, the denomination(s) of a musician influenced her activity in a particular manner. Although this information is not provided for 21,302 musicians of the database (75.7%), research questions may include references to a musician's denomination(s). One denomination is given for 6,733 musicians, two denominations for 117 musicians, and for two musicians even three denominations are provided. Therefore, we use the Jaccard index also to determine the denomination similarity S den 8 (m i , m j ) between m i and m j in dependency on the musicians' denominations den(m i ) and den(m j ) as S den 8 (m i , m j ) = J den(m i ), den(m j ) . In case of unknown denominations |den(m i )| = |den(m j )| = 0, we define S den 8 (m i , m j ) = 0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">THE PROFILING OF MUSICIANS</head><p>The idea of musician profiling is to detect a user-defined number N of similar musicians s 1 ,...,s N , who shared similar attributes with a given musician m of interest. The profiles of all observed musicians are visualized in three different views: Column Explorer, Relationship Graph and Map.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Profiling Workflow</head><p>Initially, the musicologist enters the musician m of interest for whom the profile is visualized in the previously mentioned visual interfaces.</p><p>Observing the various attributes of m, the scholar is able to define mandatory profiling attributes. A similar musician s then requires to share this attribute. Possible mandatory attributes are:</p><p>• Musical &amp; further professions, divisions, denomination(s): s shares all mandatory attributes of m in these categories.</p><p>• Activity time: The intersection of the activity time ranges of m and s is not empty.</p><p>• Place(s) of Activity: All mandatory places of activity of m were also places of activity of s.</p><p>The selection of mandatory attributes supports specific research questions like "Find the most similar musicians to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart with the musical profession concertmaster who worked at a court and who had Salzburg as place of activity!" Mozart worked as a concertmaster at the court of Salzburg between 1772 and 1777. Although the database does not contain information if a musician worked at a specific place in a certain profession, the system is capable of providing hints to investigate such questions. After selecting mandatory attributes, the musicologist performs the first profiling iteration based on all similarity measures defined in the previous section. The weight w i of a similarity measure S i is automatically determined in dependency on the diversity of available attributes in relation to the attributes of m in the corresponding dimension. With the number n of musicians m 1 ,...,m n with the given attribute (m / ∈ m 1 ,...,m n ), we define w i as</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">w i = 1 − ∑ n k=1 S i (m, m k ) n .</formula><p>An example is given by the weight w 1 for sex similarity S sex 1 . The database contains 23,865 male musicians (84.8%), 3,538 female musicians (12.6%) and 751 musicians (2.7%) without a sex information. When profiling similar musicians for Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the initial weight for sex similarity is w 1 = 0.13 as the database contains mostly male musicians. An initial profiling on Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's wife Constanze Mozart would use w 1 = 0.87 due to the comparatively small number of female musicians.</p><p>The result of the first profiling iteration are N similar musicians s 1 ,...,s N . As outlined above, the profiles of s 1 ,...,s N are visualized alongside the profile of m. That individual attributes are easy to track, a certain color is assigned to each musician. As N is usually small -less than ten similar musicians -, we use the ColorBrewer <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> to generate a qualitative color map that provides solely saturated colors to be used on the bright website background. In further iterations of the profiling process, the musicologist can gradually modify mandatory attributes and similarity weights as desired in order to receive similar musicians with certain attributes relevant to the posed research question. In Section 6, we illustrate several usage scenarios with interesting findings to emphasize the benefit of this interactive visual analytics approach for the collaborating musicologists.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Column Explorer</head><p>Inspired by Jigsaw's list view <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> and Parallel Tag Clouds <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, we designed an interface that allows for the exploration of various metadata information provided. The Column Explorer consists of various columns that serve various purposes. Lifetime Data In a vertical timeline, the temporal metadata of all observed musicians is visualized in vertical slots. If provided, we put marks for the date of birth (additionally highlighted with a star symbol 5), the first mentioned date (slightly larger mark), and the date of death (additionally highlighted with a cross symbol ¦). The shapes used as marks reflect the precision of the provided dating. A small horizontal line is used for precise datings, and circles q highlight around datings. Triangles v mark before datings as they point to the start of the vertical timeline, thus, upside down triangles w illustrate after datings. The lifetime of a musician is shown with a vertical line in the corresponding color that connects dates of birth and death. Various examples are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>Nominal Textual Metadata Four columns list the occurring musical and further professions, divisions and denomination(s) of m and s 1 ,...,s N . In each column, the attributes of m are listed first in alphabetical order. By descending similarity, further attributes of the determined similar musicians are listed. Being the most powerful metaphor of tag clouds <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, we use variable font size of labels to encode the number of attribute occurrences. If a musician does not have an attribute in a certain column, we put a "no information" label to communicate this information -an often mentioned demand of the musicologists of our project. Clicking an attribute label toggles its mandatory selection for the profiling process. Only attribute labels (except "no information" labels) belonging to m can be selected.</p><p>In Jigsaw's list view, attributes from different columns are connected if they belong to the same data entity. Also, in Parallel Tag Clouds various tags are connected after selection. We use these ideas and display the coherence of the attributes of each musician as colored streams passing all columns of the Column Explorer. Starting from the legend, a stream marks the activity time of the corresponding musician in the timeline. Thereby, the occlusion of streams illustrates similar activity times. After passing the timeline, a stream runs through all related attributes of a musician. In case of multiple attributes, a stream splits and passes the corresponding attributes. This metaphor aims to visualize occurring correlations among various attributes of musicians and to further facilitate the visual comparison of different profiles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Relationship Graph</head><p>The relationship graph of our profiling system is invaluable for the collaborating musicologists as it provides the view on a musician's social network for the first time visually. Furthermore, musicians that connect two observed musicians of interest become visible. For many musicians, a list of relationships to other musicians in the database <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. A profiling for musicians similar to court composer Georg Friedrich Handel. The musical profession composer (Komponist) and the division court (Hof) are marked as mandatory. The results are shown disregarding popularity (w p = 0) and taking popularity into account (w p = 1).</p><p>is provided. Possible relation types between two musicians and the strength of each relationship are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>. Taking all relationships of m and s 1 ,...,s N forms a social network graph with vertices representing musicians and edges connecting related musicians. In order to facilitate an easy exploration of the graph, we only take the direct relationships of each musician into account. Furthermore, we add the relationships between related musicians / ∈ {m, s 1 ,...,s N } to receive a closed social network. We use a force-directed algorithm to generate the network graph. We thereby map the strengths of relationships to intended ideal edge lengths when computing the layout. An example social network is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>. The observed musician vertices for m and s 1 ,...,s N are drawn in the corresponding color, and their full name is shown next to it. To keep the social network explorable, all additional musicians are drawn as gray vertices, and only the first four letters of their names are shown. The latter design decision reduces the occurrences of occluding labels to a minimum while alongside providing an "adequate information" for the musicologist, who is usually aware of the social relations of the observed musician(s). More detailed information can be shown using mouseover interaction. Hovering a gray vertex pops up the full name of the corresponding musician, whereas hovering an edge provides the roles of the two connected musicians in their relationship. Unobserved, but potentially interesting musicians shown in the social network graph can be added to the profile visualization via mouse click. A mouse click onto the vertices representing m and s 1 ,...,s N visualizes the shortest paths to all other musicians under investigation. This feature supports the musicologists in examining the channels through which information was most probably transferred in former times.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Map</head><p>The map of the profiling system visualizes all places of activity provided for m and s 1 ,...,s N . The focus of interest is to facilitate the visual interpretation of a certain activity region and to support the comparison of different activity regions. A location that was only the activity place of one of the musicians under inspection is displayed as a single circle with a radius r c drawn in the corresponding color. Quite often, musicians shared the same places of activity. For example, Munich was a place of activity for 10,558 musicians of the database (37.5%). To forestall the misinterpretation of activity regions through occluding individual circles, we draw a pie chart for each shared place. We scale the radius r p of a pie chart dependent on the number of associated musicians to avoid visual distortion. To receive pie slices with the same area as an individual circle, we define r p as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">r p = √ N • r c .</formula><p>All shapes are drawn slightly transparent to avoid losing the geographical context in dense regions. An example is given in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5</ref>. Hovering a shape displays a popup that shows the place name and a list of related musicians.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">USAGE SCENARIOS</head><p>The traditional approach of searching for similarities between musicians is biased due to the inhomogeneous state of research (popularity). Rather observing the similarities among the other musician's attributes, the usage of the profiling system revealed substantial anomalies in contrast to this traditional approach. The first out of four scenarios provided by musicologists using our system exemplifies this issue.</p><p>Profiling Georg Friedrich Handel Handel is one of the most popular court composers. A musicologist used the profiling system to iteratively discover court composers of the same era (mandatory activity time, division court and musical profession composer) with similar careers. The initial profiling result shows similar musicians from different generations with first mentioned datings ranging from 1691 to 1731. Now increasing the weight for activity time (w tem 2 = 1) and ignoring activity regions (w geo 3 = 0) better models the musicologists imagination of a "same era" by narrowing this time range (1691-1708). Then, the musicologist tests various combinations of weights for popularity and denomination disregarding relations (w rel 4 = 0) with interesting insights (in all combinations the era range remains small). The set of similar musicians for various popularity settings and w den 8 = 1 changes only slightly and always contains popular Evangelical-Lutheran musicians like Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Philipp Telemann. By further applying varying denominational significance and using w p = 0, the musicologist discovers unexpected, very similar profiles to Handel in terms of musical professions and divisions for rather unknown musicians with activity places in southern European regions; especially, two Italian musicians are in the result set. With Venice, Rome and Naples, Handel had an active period in three Italian cities. As w geo 3 = 0 was used, this correlation hypothesizes mutual influences between Handel and the musicians found as well as an Italian influence on Handel's work. Now mimicking the traditional profiling approach based upon print media by applying w p = 1, most of the rather unknown musicians are replaced by popular ones with a lesser similarity regarding musical professions and divisions (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). Especially the similarity between Handel and Antonio Vivaldi -both sharing only few characteristics -seemed accidental to the musicologist. Thus, this use case exemplifies the biased influence of popularity. But the tool opens new research perspectives by focusing rather unknown but more similar musicians as opposed to focusing popular musicians.</p><p>Profiling Meinrad Spieß Starting a profiling for musicians similar to monastery composer Spieß, a musicologist would predominantly refer to musicological editions and monographs. According to them, the results of this traditional approach would be again biased due to the inhomogeneous state of research (popularity). Our profiling system was used to search for musicians similar to Spieß disregarding popularity (w p = 0). The initial profiling step shows a list of other southern German Catholic church musicians of the early modern era. To further specify the profile scheme, the musicologist increases the weight for activity region, activity time, division and denomination similarity, whereas the weight for relationship similarity is lowered. As the result differs only slightly, the weights for denomination and activity region are set to 0. Then, middle German Protestant contemporaries occur -a comprehensible fact as Spieß (1) was an active member of Lorenz Mizler's musical circle in Leipzig, and (2) corresponded frequently with academy colleagues outside his denominational bounds and activity region. A particular observation is an obvious similarity to musicians belonging to a generation that essentially characterized the bandmaster profession. Similarities are discovered to the known musicians Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Friedrich Handel, and other representatives of this first bandmaster generation -a fact hardly recognized in previous music research. Approaching insights this way is a novel technique in musicology. An also known, but never visualized phenomenon in musicology are homogeneous subcultures of the early modern era. By only regarding relational similarities for Spieß, the musicologist detects a closed Benedictine network composed of Spieß' students and the relatives of his own teacher Bernabei.</p><p>Profiling Maier Kohn The cantor is one of the most multifarious musical professions in cultural history. The characteristics of this profession equally depend on chronology, cultural area and denomination. Consequently, the responsibilities of a cantor are widespread and the term cantor is impractical to be used as musical vocabulary. The map shows places of activity from Mozart, Bach, and relationships who connect both musicians in the social network to analyze potential places where related musicians met each other or worked together. The city Bologna marks a shared place of activity on one possible transfer path of Bach's score to Mozart.</p><p>Subsequently, cantors cannot be easily retrieved using the Bavarian Musicians Encyclopedia Online. The musicologist requires an analysis in dependency on the various duties of the cantor profession. Using the profiling system, this multifacetedness can be visualized and analyzed in individual cases. The Jewish cantor Maier Kohn had many musical responsibilities in clerical music and in school, as a singer, organist, composer and choirmaster. Similar profiles regarding musical professions that compose the cantor profession can be found in various contexts for musicians of different generations, with different activity regions and denominations. Limiting the profiling to Jewish musicians with similar profiles provides a list of Jewish cantors (e.g., Salomon Sulzer and Joseph Freudenthal) with many varying musical professions (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). This brief meta-analytic test reveals a contradiction to the anti-Semitic influenced state of research of the early 20th century. At that time, musicologists claimed a monotonous interpretation of the cantor profession for Jewish musicians. But the multifaceted musical professions of all cantors in the result suggest a diversity similar to known Christian cantors. According to the anti-Semitic research, Maier Kohn was therefore not a "typical Jew". His strong similarity to Christian cantors when disregarding Jewish denomination in the profiling underpins this fact. This example outlines the utility of the profiling system to transform a musicological issuethe multifacetedness of the musical profession cantor -, which is not existent in the database, into a representation visualized as the Column Explorer.</p><p>The missing link between Johann Sebastian Bach &amp; Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart This example illustrates the usage of the system without its profiling capacity. Mozart was born few years after Bach's death, but Mozart played Bach's music. Mozart primarily worked at southern German Catholic residences where the trade with music supplies was unincisive. An interesting research question for the musicologist arose: "What was the connection through which Bach's score was transferred to Mozart?" First, the musicologist visualizes the profile of both musicians. Second, the relationship graph is explored and candidates on probable pathways between Bach and Mozart are added to the profile visualization (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>). Taking all visualized attributes into account, the musicologist is now able to measure possible pathways, especially by observing shared places of activity (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5)</ref>. Although the musicologist requires additional literature to examine this question more precisely, the system provides valuable evidence to narrow the number of possibilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">DISCUSSION</head><p>The proposed profiling system was designed to support answering a novel type of research question in musicology. Some aspects of the collaborative work are outlined below.</p><p>Evaluation When developing the profiling system, we closely collaborated with four musicologists -a professor, a PhD student and two M.Sc. students -, who iteratively evaluated current prototypes. One of the key features of the profiling system was the design of similarity measures for relevant musician attributes included in the profiling process. Some of the similarity measures were refined step-bystep to incorporate musicological knowledge in order to gain results that meet the expectations of the musicologists. For example, when designing the activity region similarity, we always provided a list of place tuples with their calculated similarities to the musicologists to ensure an appropriate representation of musicological imagination of space. When determining relationship similarity -first defined for two musicians only by their distance in the social network graph -we mapped relationship strengths, provided by the musicologists, to edge lengths. As a result, familial relationships form clusters, which was an important requirement of the musicologists. Activity time similarity -first defined as lifetime similarity by birth and death of musicianswas also iteratively modified. Here, the inclusion of first mentioned dates and the mapping of uncertainties allowed us to define this similarity measure more precisely. The visualization of the profiling system was also iteratively improved and evaluated by the musicologists to meet their needs. This included both aspects of visual representation and interaction design. We could communicate our own concerns as well. For instance, we thought that overlapping streams in the vertical timeline are too confusing. But the musicologists prevented us from changing this representation arguing that it perfectly reflects their imagination of activity time similarity. As there is no ground truth regarding the profiling of musicians, the accuracy of our approach is not easy to measure. Sometimes, surprising and unexpected results occur. Being involved in all development stages, the musicologists assess individual similarity measures as well as entire profiling results as reasonable, which underpins the benefit of our method for musicology.</p><p>Limitations Being a challenge for developing the visual analytics system on the one hand, the existence of uncertain temporal metadata slightly affects the reliability of a profiling result. As the BMLO gets updated gradually, the removal of uncertainties requires future effort for musicologists using the database. A further limitation concerns the missing consideration of historical circumstances when calculating activity region similarities. First, the meaning of a geographical distance varies for different ages. Whereas a travel between European cities required several weeks in the Renaissance era, such a trip takes only few hours nowadays. Second, the usage of contemporary political conditions cannot be applied appropriately to historical contexts, although our collaborative solution turned out to be heuristically valuable for musicologists. But the elaboration of historical place identifiers could further improve the profiling result. As the provided textual metadata is not linked, e.g., the existence of "London" as activity place, "bandmaster" as musical profession and "church" as division does not imply that a musician indeed was a bandmaster at a church in London. The interpretation of such information still requires a musicologist's knowledge or the usage of further sources. In terms of scalability, our proposed system is designed to compare the profiles of a rather small number of musicians -distinguishable through various colors -, usually less than ten. Therefore, general research interests like analyzing and comparing all court composers is not supported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future Work</head><p>The BMLO is an ongoing digital humanities project under crowdsourcing aspects. Next to potential future data transformation and data representation challenges, the collaborating musicologists suggested several improvement prospects to determine similar musicians more precisely. First, the inclusion of hierarchical information into the profiling process was an often discussed issue. At the moment, a hierarchy is only given for musical professions. According to the musicologists, hierarchical representations for other text-based metadata dimensions (further professions, divisions), hierarchical relationship strengths or the calculation of activity region similarities taking historical circumstances into account could further strengthen the result of a profiling process. Consequently, we would need to adapt similarity measures and the visualization, especially the Column Explorer. Another future work is the profiling for coupled musicians -a novel type of research question stimulated through our profiling system. For instance, the profiling result for musicians similar to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Johann Sebastian Bach in a single request could answer the question if a found musician would be more similar to Mozart or to Bach. As a straightforward adaption of the similarity measures does not anticipate adequate results, we require further interdisciplinary sessions to discuss required implementation steps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSION</head><p>As of the late 19th century, musicology focuses primarily on fifty musicians and their main works in a traditional philological manner. The achievements of other musicians only obtain less attention. The proposed profiling system aims to change this imbalance by rather throwing the spotlight on less popular musicians. Based upon a musician of interest -potentially one of the popular ones -musicologists are now capable of discovering less popular musicians with similar careers.</p><p>During the development, we closely collaborated with musicologists, who state that the resultant profiling system is a valuable analysis instrument that serves a novel type of research interest and provokes new research questions. Thereby, we designed the profiling system the way that it can easily be adapted to other historical groups of people.</p><p>Our presented approach facilitates comparative methods and research questions concerning musicians -for the first time with the aid of visual means. As the visualization indicates historical circumstances and cultural contexts, it gets possible to review time-dependent ideological opinions about individual musicians. Usage scenarios showcasing Handel's, Spieß' and Kohn's careers demonstrate this capability of the profiling system.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>4 . 3 Activity Region Similarity S reg 3</head><label>433</label><figDesc>F min = B (or F = B), and if F max &gt; D (or F &gt; D) we set F max = D (or F = D). The activity time t(m) = {t min (m),t max (m)} of a musician m is determined based upon the given dates as follows: • if F or F min and D are defined and unequal, we set t min (m) = F or t min (m) = F min and t max (m) = D • else if F min and F max are defined, we set t min (m) = F min and t max (m) = F max • else if F is provided, we define F max by applying the after uncertainty to F and use t min (m) = F and t max (m) = F max • else if B and D are provided, we use t min (m) = B + 20 years and t max (m) = D In the rare cases if only B or only D are provided, the definition of an activity time range is too hypothetical according to the musicologists. In such cases, the corresponding similarity is always S tem 2 (m i , m j ) = 0. In case of two valid activity time ranges, we define S tem 2 (m i , m j ) using the Jaccard index as S tem 2 (m i , m j ) = J t(m i ),t(m j ) . The database contains places of activity, where musicians lived or worked for a certain period of time. At least one such place is provided for 26,101 musicians (92.8%) in the database. For the most often occurring 1,661 places of activity, geographical coordinates as longitude/latitude pairs and hierarchical place IDs for the contemporary political belonging of a place are given.
