<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Quantitative evaluation is the cornerstone of the scientific discovery process and it is no-less important for relatively young fields, such as visualization, virtual reality and human-computer interaction. Tory and Moller <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> have underlined the importance of testing visualization systems, as part of human-factors research in visualization. In the IEEE Information Visualization Conference of 2014, roughly half of C. <ref type="bibr">Papadopoulos</ref> the accepted papers included some sort of formal evaluation through empirical experimentation. Similar trends can be observed in the majority of seminal conferences and journals that focus on human-centric computing.</p><p>These experiments are primarily conducted as evidence supporting the value of a newly introduced technique and/or contrasting the effectiveness of several established methods. These goals are pursued by performing statistical analysis, driven by a set of hypotheses aimed at answering high-level research questions. When presenting the results of these experiments, scientists follow their exposition of the analysis with a discussion, putting the results in context. Often this process involves inspecting the performance of individual participants under the prism of the analysis results or isolating and visualizing only parts of the experiment design. This post-hoc exploratory process is critical for three reasons. Firstly, it further validates the results of the statistical analysis. Secondly, it generates insights that can not be captured directly through statistics (due to the generally low granularity of the effects of independent variables). Finally, it provides future research directions that drive the conduct of more specific or differently targeted experiments through the generation of new hypotheses.</p><p>The importance of empirical evaluation has driven researchers to develop visual analysis systems, specifically targeted at the exploration of their experimental data. Blascheck and Ertl <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> have suggested a generalizable methodology for visual experiment analysis with a seeming focus on eye-tracking data. Generally, efforts to leverage visualization for the exploration of empirical studies are targeted at specific domains. However, the underlying data (the experimental design, the types of metrics, etc.) tend to be similar across domains. This uniformity can be leveraged for the development of a generalizable framework for the analysis of empirical experimental data.</p><p>In this paper, we introduce VEEVVIE, the Visual Explorer for Empirical Visualization, VR and Interaction Experiments. VEEVVIE is a versatile tool that enables the visual analysis of empirical experiments in visualization and human-computer interaction. At its core, VEEVVIE is driven by an ontology that can model a wide range of experimental designs, with arbitrary variable, measurement and sample sizes. This ontology can, on its own, capture multiple experimental designs that are based on "common" measurements (e.g., ordinal or interval). Driven by this ontology, VEEVVIE generates several familiar linked information visualizations of experimental measurements with support for interactive brushing across different pivots. This functionality is enabled by the relational information captured by the ontology, which connects trials, to measurements, participants and experimental conditions. Additionally, the VEEVVIE ontology can be expanded to support domain-specific data types. Through a plug-in architecture, new visualization widgets can integrate in the VEEVVIE workspace and ingest this domain-specific data. We demonstrate VEEVVIE through several use cases, examining data from a prior visualization experiment.</p><p>Our paper is structured as follows. We begin with an overview of previous work relating to empirical experiments and their visualization. We continue by motivating the design decisions for VEEVVIE and then present the ontology that drives our visual analytics framework. Following this groundwork, we describe how VEEVVIE leverages this ontology to enable extensible visual analysis of experimental data. We present a set of case studies, and conclude with directions for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>In this section we provide a brief overview of some fundamentals of experimental design that are relevant to the architecture of VEEVVIE. We also overview some instances of experimental evaluation in visualization and human-computer interaction, which influence the design that powers our visual explorer. Finally, we overview some existing tools that have been used for the visual analysis of experimental data in the sciences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Experimental Design</head><p>Since at least Lind's work on the treatment of scurvy <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, controlled experimentation has been an essential tool of the scientific process. Critical to the value of a controlled experiment is its design, the set of parameters that define how it will be conducted. Experimental design has been covered in countless books and scientific articles, from Fisher's fundamental work <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> to modern textbooks <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Such designs involve several important decisions, like the selection of meaningful factors at which to perform measurements, the assignment strategy of participants to factor levels, the types of measurements that are important to a productive statistical analysis, etc. In order to define the semantics that drive VEEVVIE, we are interested in the aspects of an experiment's design that can be used to characterize the resulting information. Specifically, we are interested in the following:</p><p>• Independent Variables -The aspects of the experiment that are controlled and explicitly varied by the experimenters. Independent variables have levels or predetermined values. For example, in an HCI experiment, the interaction device could be an independent variable, with mouse, touch and gamepad being its levels. • Participants -A sample of the population being evaluated that takes part in the experiment. In an HCI experiment conducted at a research university, the participants may include students taking a class for credit, laypeople who respond to a recruitment flyer, etc. Participants often are characterized based on demographical information (such as age or sex), various aptitude questionnaires (e.g., spatial cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, simulator sickness <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>), etc.</p><p>The measurement of some/all of the dependent variables at a certain combination of levels of independent variables for a certain participant is termed a trial. The totality of trials forms the product of an experiment and the data generated by the trials serves as input to different forms of analyses. For a given experiment design, there might exist several statistical methods can be leveraged for analysis of the product data, depending on the number of independent variables, the types of dependent variables, the total number of participants, the source population that the experiment targets and, sometimes, the personal preference and/or scientific background of the researchers. Ultimately though, statistical analyses seek to find significant effects of the independent variables on the dependent variables. Main effects characterize the impact of a single independent variable on a measurement. Interaction effects are present when the effects of two or more independent variables on a dependent variable are not additive. Part of VEEVVIE's ontology and visualization is targeted at modeling these effects. We consider the statistical analysis process itself to be separate and done a-priori to the visual exploration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Experimental Evaluation in Visualization, VR and HCI</head><p>Experimental evaluation is commonplace in the fields of visualization, virtual reality and HCI. For example, early work by Bowman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> described multiple experiments that evaluated several travel techniques for virtual environments. The experiments included a small number of factors (between 1 and 3) and a single dependent variable (time to task completion). Yu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> have proposed and evaluated an elaborate touch interface for 3D visualization. They utilized a within-subjects design with the independent variable being the input method and the dependent variable being the elapsed time to task completion. A subsection of their experiment was not subject to statistical analysis (this happens frequently with open-ended tasks that yield useful qualitative feedback). Ball and North <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> have conducted an experiment with two independent variables (display size and peripheral vision), measuring their impact on performance (time to completion or accuracy) across different tasks. Another experiment by the same research group <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> also incorporated the collection of motion tracking data and estimated gaze trajectories for each trial. Cashion et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> have evaluated four different 3D selection techniques (the first independent variable) across five usage tasks (the second dependent variable). Their experiment measured error rates and time to completion. They also administered pre and post study questionnaires to their participants. Endert et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> conducted an experiment that evaluated performance (time and accuracy) across several visualization designs, with overall visualization size and glyph design being the independent factors. The scientists also collected physical navigation data which is productively used in their discussion. An complete overview of visualization and interaction literature that includes experimental evaluation is unrealistic within the constraints of this paper. Through this brief review we want to underline the commonalities between experimental designs in our fields:</p><p>• Small numbers of independent (e.g., interaction modality, visualization design, task, etc) and dependent variables (elapsed time, accuracy, etc.).</p><p>• Pre-and post-experiment questionnaires that are administered per-subject.</p><p>• Supplementary per-trial data, such as motion tracking which is leveraged to either produce additional dependent variables (e.g., travel distance) or as material for discussion.</p><p>The ontology that we describe later in this paper is based on these characteristics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Visual Analytics for Experiments</head><p>Visual analytics tools have been proposed for several domainspecific applications, some of which involve or are centered around hypothesis-testing via empirical experiments. For example, recent work by Palmas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> descrived the MovExp tool which fused biomechanical simulations with performance data from interaction tasks in order to assist HCI developers. Their tool is similar to VEEVVIE in that it allows the linked visualization of generic performance data together with interface-specific visualizations and domainrelevant views. However, it is does not seem to expose data related to hypothesis testing (such as statistically significant effects). Papers by Andrienko et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and Kurzhals and Weiskopf <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> introduce several techniques for the exploration of data stemming from eye-tracking studies. Tools proposed by Steenwijk et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> and, more recently, by Klemm et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> focused on the exploration of cohort studies in the medical domain. Their motivation is similar to that of VEEVVIE, e.g., hypothesis validation and generation. It is also worth noting that general-purpose multidimensional coordinated visualizations can be used to perform visual analysis of experimental data. Systems like Polaris <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> and Improvise <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref> could ingest information that is modeled in our ontology. Still, we posit that, due to their more generic nature and intent to serve as visualization "design" platforms, they are significantly more complex to use, particularly for non-experts. Overall, our review of the literature has led us to the conclusion that, while visual analysis is a part of several experimental evaluations in visualization, HCI and virtual reality, the tools that enable such types of analyses (without the complexity burdens imposed by targeting generic information visualization) do not readily exist.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">DEFINING THE PROBLEM SPACE</head><p>In this section, we outline some examples of visual analytics that are used in a complementary fashion to statistical analysis as part of visualization and interaction experiments. We move on to define several key "tasks" that emanate from those and other works and also briefly summarize the information that concretely describes a visualization experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Examples of Visual Analysis for Experiments</head><p>The design of VEEVVIE is based on the utilization of visual analysis experiments conducted by our research group and also those described in the literature. For example, Ball et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> generated simple visualizations of user movement and gain estimation during different tasks on a tiled display. A sample observation was that during an "insight" task, when participants were provided with a lectern for notetaking, physical navigation was substantially different and clustered around the lectern. This observation led to a recommendation later in the article. They also utilized visualizations to reinforce the statistical findings, which indicated that increases in display width resulted in increases in physical navigation. Bezerianos et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> utilized motion trajectory visualizations in order to categorize select participants' movement strategies, which then served as input into further statistical analysis. Overall, we have observed that usage of visualization in the exploration of experimental data generally focuses on filtering, summarizing and highlighting aspects of the experiment, in a manner driven by the findings of the statistical analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Tasks</head><p>Overall we identify the following tasks that researchers might want to perform on their experimental data using a visual analysis tool:</p><p>1. Emergence of the sources of statistical effects. Given a significant difference between two levels of a factor, or an interaction between two factors, the visualization tool should enable the rapid identification of the subset of the experiment that falls under those factors.</p><p>2. Cross-experiment identification of trials or subjects. During the visual analysis process, the researcher might identify a set of trials or subjects that exhibit an interesting pattern (e.g., combination of trial measurements, etc). The visual analysis tool should permit the quick investigation of these datums under different visualization modalities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Summarization of experimental results across different pivots.</head><p>The visualizations generated by the tool should enable visual aggregations of the results across different dimensions of the experiment (e.g., across all subjects, across trials, etc).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Filtering experimental data based on the current analytical task.</head><p>When investigating a subset of the experiment (e.g., a particular significant difference between two levels of a four-level variable), the tool should allow the removal of non-relevant information. Similar functionality should be enabled across other pivots of the experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Input Data</head><p>As described earlier, an experiment is fundamentally a set of trials, measurements conducted for participants at different experimental conditions. Trials are the core data that drives VEEVVIE and the ontology that we describe in the next section allows us to uniquely characterize them. Each trial occurs for a particular combination of levels for different independent variables (effectively at a cell of the experimental design matrix). Every trial is associated with a single experiment participant. This is a deliberate design decision since the majority of experiments that we have encountered are non-collaborative. Each trial also corresponds to a number of values for the dependent variables that are being observed. These variables can result from direct observations during a particular trial (e.g., the accuracy of a participant at a certain task) or from post-processing information that was collected during the trial (e.g., calculating travel distances based on motion tracking data). These measurements can be nominal, ordinal or interval, or they can be described in an experiment-specific data format. Additionally, several experiments (particularly ones that are based on repeated-measures designs) often require more than one trial per participant at each cell of the design matrix. These repeated trials are generally consistent across participants in order to reduce confounds. Thus, each trial is also characterized by a set of grouping factors that can describe these correlations. The trial descriptions, along with higher-level experiment meta-data (such as the totality of independent and dependent variables, their types, their potential values), experiment-wide measurements for each subject (e.g., pre-and post-experiment questionnaires) and descriptions of the statistical effects yielded by the analysis are the input data to VEEVVIE. It also worth noting that we have identified designs for which the statistical analysis is carried out within individual grouping factors (but without considering the factors themselves as an independent variable). This information is summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">AN ONTOLOGY FOR DESCRIBING EXPERIMENTS</head><p>Given the above task definitions and input data, we designed an ontology that can represent a wide range of experimental designs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Core Classes</head><p>The primary building block of an ontology is the notion of a class. The VEEVVIE ontology defines several classes that allow the description of experimental data.</p><p>• Experiment -Instances of Experiment are objects that own the totality of information for a particular study. • Participant -Instances of Participant describe individuals who partook in the experiment. Participant does not explicitly define any properties for demographical information. Rather, these are modeled as instances of ExperimentWideMeasurement.</p><p>• IndependentVariable -Class for describing the independent variables of the experiment. The valid levels of each variable are attributes to its instance.</p><p>• Measurement -Instances of Measurement describe a metric that is substantive to the experiment, either as whole or stemming from a single trial. The type of the measurement (ordinal, interval, nominal, or other custom types) are appended as attributes to instances of this class. Note that this is effectively an abstract class.</p><p>• DependentVariable -Subclass of Measurement. Describes dependent variables, the values of which result from experimental trials (e.g., an accuracy or performance metric).</p><p>• ExperimentWideMeasurement -Subclass of Measurement. Describes metrics, the values of which are only acquired once for each participant during the experiment (e.g., demographical data, pre/post study questionnaires, etc).</p><p>• IndependentVariableValue -Instances of this class describe a fixed value of a certain factor. These are referred to by instances of Trial in order to determine membership to a particular cell of the experimental design matrix.</p><p>• DependentVariableValue -Class for describing a measurement of a particular DependentVariable. The instances of this class are owned either by the source Trial they correspond to.</p><p>• ExperimentWideMeasurementValue -Class for describing a measurement of a particular ExperimentWideMeasurement. Owned by an instance of Subject.</p><p>• GroupingFactor -Instances of GroupingFactor are referred to by trials in order to denote cross-trial groupings as outlined earlier.</p><p>• Trial -A trial brings together one or more IndependentVariabl-eValue instances (denoting its membership in the experimental matrix), one or more DependentVariableValue, one Participant instance and, optionally, one or more GroupingFactor instances to describe a measurement event.</p><p>• StatisticalEffect -This class serves as a base for subclasses describing statistical effects. It points to a target DependentVariable and also refers to a number of GroupingFactor instances, for which the statistical analysis was conducted.</p><p>• MainEffect -This class describes a main effect of an instance of IndependentVariable. It also contains as attributes pairs of significant differences, as provided by the statistical analysis.</p><p>• InteractionEffect -Instances of InteractionEffect bring together two or more IndependentVariables (as provided by the statistical analysis) to describe an interaction on a DependentVariable (pointed by the base class).</p><p>The VEEVVIE ontology and relationships between classes are schematically illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>. It is worth noting that our ontology (and VEEVVIE in general) can work in a complementary way to experimental design support systems, such as Touchstone <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, enabling post-hoc visual analysis after an experiment has been conducted. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Application to Experiments</head><p>Our ontology is applicable to experiments in the fields of visualization, HCI and VR. To illustrate this point, we have used it to model the experimental evaluations presented in several pieces of research work. These modelings can be seen in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Implementation</head><p>The VEEVVIE ontology is accessible through a series of RESTfull <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> endpoints. The core web application functionality is implemented on top of NodeJS 1 , with the Sails.js 2 framework handling interactions with a MongoDB 3 database and enabling Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) functionality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">THE VEEVVIE FRONT-END</head><p>In this section, we describe the VEEVVIE front-end (seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>), through which researchers can conduct visual analysis of experimental data modeled in our ontology. We illustrate some of the generic visualization modalities, the overall functionality of our interface, technical implementation details and also ways in which VEEVVIE can be extended to visualize experiment-specific data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Layout and Functionality</head><p>The VEEVVIE front-end application defines three main interaction areas. On the left-hand side of the screen the user finds the persistent data selection controls, contained in a sidebar. The user can select an experiment to be loaded from the back-end. Following this selection, the left-hand sidebar populates with persistent data-filtering tools. Specifically, VEEVVIE allows researchers to drill-down into subsections of the experiment by excluding combinations of levels of independent variables, grouping factors and/or subjects from the visual analysis.</p><p>The main VEEVVIE workspace occupies the majority of the screen. At the top of the workspace lays the visualization generation toolbar which allows researchers to inject visualization widgets into the workspace. The user binds experiment measurements to different widget dimensions or axes and can also set various options. Widgets declare options and support for different types of measurements as described below. VEEVVIE widgets are responsive, resizable and can be moved around the workspace.</p><p>VEEVVIE leverages heavily the principles of coordinated multiple views <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. Through a standardized API, visualization widgets can  <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>. Sample (simplified) declaration of a visualization widget. Widgets can declaratively define dimensions (including repeatable dimensions, e.g., for an arbitrarily dimensional visualization) and supported data types. Additionally, widgets can define custom options (e.g. toggleable brushing behavior). This declarative approach allows widgets to integrate with and digest the VEEVVIE ontology in a way that is agnostics to the inner workings of the application.</p><p>request highlighting of combinations of trials, subjects, or independent variable factors which are propagated throughout the active view. Additionally, most VEEVVIE widgets support transient brushing operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> which trigger highlight operations. Custom widgets can also access this functionality through a standardized API.</p><p>A sample view of the VEEVVIE front-end can be seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Implementation and Extensibility</head><p>The VEEVVIE front-end is implemented using standards-complaint HTML5, CSS and Javascript. We opted for a browser-based solution rather than developing a native application because it enables rapid development-testing-iteration cycles, cross-platform deployment and access to several open-source and extremely powerful visualization and interaction frameworks. The VEEVVIE front-end is structured as an AngularJS 4 application and makes heavy use of its data binding functionality for the propagation of active filtering, highlighting and widget state options. The visualizations are based on the Highcharts SDK 5 , Data-Driven Documents <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> and Kai Chang's D3.js parallel coordinates library <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> . The architecture of VEEVVIE allows the development of visualization plugins without knowledge of the inner workings of the front-end or ontology back-end systems. The plug-in API defines several callback functions for creating a visualization, responding to resize events, reacting to and generating changes in filtering, highlighting, etc. These callbacks are implemented by delegates, which define the functionality of new visualizations. Delegates also declare the dimensions and corresponding supported data types for their widget (which are used to populate the UI and also determine valid experimental variables). Additionally, they can define creation-time options which are also presented to the user via the main VEEVVIE UI. Interactions are handled programmatically. A sample declaration for one of the built-in widgets of our front-end can be seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. The front-end provides each delegate with a DOM element in which it can render its content and also several helper classes for managing access to experimental data, retrieving simple statistics and ensuring a consistent appearance <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. Sample view of the VEEVVIE front-end during a visual exploration session. The data filtering controls are visible in the sidebar on the lefthand side (a). These enable researchers to drill down data by toggling on/off factors of independent variables, grouping factors, and/or individual subjects. Visualizations can be generated through the toolbar at the top of the interface (b) by selecting a widget and then binding experimental measurements to dimensions. Widgets appear in the main workspace (c) and are moveable, resizeable and responsive. The four widgets visible in this image are: the statistical-effect explorer, the subject-centric visualizer, a parallel coordinates visualization of the experiment and a presence heatmap visualization. scheme across widgets. We found that this affords flexibility in the widget development process. Widgets can be created separate from the relatively heavy-weight VEEVVIE front-end and then ported to the final system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Built-in Visualizations</head><p>Using the VEEVVIE widget architecture, we have implemented several visualization widgets that allow researchers to visually explore experiments that are centered around numerical or categorical dependent variables. Overall, these widgets were chosen so as to be immediately familiar to non-experts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1">Multidimensional Visualization Widgets</head><p>Traditional multi-dimensional visualization is provided through two widgets, scatterplots and parallel coordinate visualizations, illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5</ref>.</p><p>Researchers can create interactive scatterplots of trials, across arbitrary pairs of dependent variables (or experiment-wide measurements). Scatterplots support zooming and brushing. Brushing on scatterplots highlights the selected trials across all active visualizations while hovering over a single datum with the mouse pointer will either highlight that single trial across the workspace or (if a modifier key is active) highlight all measurements traced to the subject of the current trial. Thus, researchers can visually identify outliers in the visualization of two performance metrics and then identify if these outliers also correlate to other aberrations in the source data.</p><p>We also provide a parallel coordinates <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> visualization widget which can be configured to display all or a subset of the measurements and/or independent variables of the experimental design. Individual polylines correspond to single trials. Experiment-wide measurements are concatenated with the per-trial measurements for the source subject in order to complete the descriptor vector for each polyline. Parallel coordinates provide a very effective way to generate a high-level aggregate view for the entire experiment. Additionally, through axial brushing researchers can highlight increasingly narrow sections of the experimental data (e.g. all trials from a certain combination of independent variable levels that fits within a particular performance threshold) which can in-turn be applied as filtering in order to reduce cognitive load during the analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.2">Statistical Effect Explorer</head><p>As we described earlier, a critical task for the visual analysis of experimental data is the identification of the source of statistically significant effect. In order to facilitate this, VEEVVIE provides a widget that visualizes main and interaction effects that are described using its ontology. The statistical effect visualizer illustrates main effects in the form of a matrix, with cells corresponding on the presence (or not) of a significant difference between pairs of levels for a particular independent variable. Interaction effects are visualized in the form of radar charts. The combinations of levels for the independent variables of the interaction define the axis of the chart while the measurement for each axis corresponds to the mean of the dependent variable at that particular cell of the design. This approach allows to quickly visualize independent variable combinations with interesting measurement characteristics while scaling to (theoretically) arbitrary experimental designs. Both main and interaction effect visualizes support highlighting. For main effects, hovering over a particular cell of the visualization will highlight the two source populations across all supporting widgets in the workspace. Highlighting a particular factor combination brings out the source data. In both cases, tooltips provide simple descriptive statistics. The functionality of the main effect visualizer is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> while both sub-widgets can be seen also in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.3">Subject-centric Visualizer</head><p>A frequent task during the exploration of experimental data is the identification of performance patterns across participants. For example, a researcher may want to quickly identify if some participants deviated significantly from the median of a measurement and then follow that up with an investigation of the root case. To facilitate this analysis approach, VEEVVIE provides a subject-centric visualizer. The researcher can select a dependent variable and is then presented with a heatmap visualization of the performance of all (filtered) participants across all experimental design levels. The heatmap cells are color-coded (red to green) to indicate deviation from the mean of the selected dependent variable at each particular experimental condition while hovering over a cell highlights the trials that satisfy the subject × condition constraint. An example of the subject-centric visualizer is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 6</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">USAGE</head><p>In this section, we demonstrate the usage of VEEVVIE for the purposes of analyzing an experiment we conducted on the Reality Deck <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, a gigapixel-resolution immersive display. We illustrate the application of VEEVVIE for three use-cases: hypothesis validation, insight gathering and hypothesis generation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Experiment Description</head><p>The overarching goal of our experiment was to evaluate the scalability limits of large, high-resolution, immersive displays. We were motivated by prior research that illustrated the benefits of large displays in data visualization, but which did not scale those benefits to the absolutely massive display sizes and resolutions that are currently feasible. In pursuit of our goal, we designed an experiment which asked of 16 participants to complete four visualization tasks -attribute search (AS), visual search (VS), pattern finding (P) and comparisons (C). These tasks were conducted under four display resolutions, sizes and horizontal immersion fidelities -100 megapixel planarly (100MP), 300 megapixel planarly (300MP), 600 megapixel partially immersive (600MP) and 1 gigapixel fully immersive (1GP). Our main metrics concerned user performance, specifically elapsed time (ET) and scaled elapsed time (SET). We also measured subjective mental effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref> (SMEQ). Finally, we captured physical navigation data and calculated total physical navigation distance (TRAVEL). For a thorough exposition on the experimental design, tasks, data and analysis we refer our readers to Papadopoulos et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Implementing a Custom Visualization Widget</head><p>The VEEVVIE widget architecture and ontology allowed us to develop an interactive visualization tool for displaying the physical navigation trajectories captured during our experiment. We defined an  Presence heatmap for the AS task. (c) Heatmap highlight of a good performer for the VS task (small amounts of physical navigation). (d) Heatmap highlight of a poor performer for the VS task (much larger amounts of physical navigation). (e) Motion tracking paths for all participants for the VS task. All visualizations are generated for the 1G display condition.</p><p>additional dependent variable using the VEEVVIE ontology (termed TRACKING) which also had a custom data type trackingURI. We then developed a visualization widget that declared its support for the trackingURI variable type. The VEEVVIE back-end stored and delivered the Unique Resource Identifiers that corresponded to the tracking trajectory files. These files were served via another web server and our new widget handled their download. The raw trajectories (which were recorded at 120Hz) were simplified using the Douglas-Peucker algo- <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>. Illustration of utilizing VEEVVIE for the validation of hypotheses and understanding of the results of statistical analyses. In this example, the analysis did not indicate a significant difference between the 600MP and 1GP display conditions. By utilizing the statistical effect explorer, the two populations can be highlighted in the linked scatterplot shown in (a) (600MP in orange, 1GP in blue). Conversely, the 100MP condition is highlighted in orange in the parallel coordinates plot (b) along with the significantly different 1GP condition (visible in blue). The SET axis has been highlighted for emphasis and the visual pattern of the difference is visible.</p><p>rithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> in order to reduce file size and also remove jitter. The visualization was implemented using WebGL and the BabylonJS 8 scene graph. Our tracking visualizer widget can display trajectories and also generate simple heatmaps of user presence via quad-splatting. It also supports the VEEVVIE highlighting functionalities. Samples views of the tracking data visualizer widget can be see in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 7</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Case 1: Hypothesis Validation</head><p>Prior to our experiment, we hypothesized that larger (in terms of resolution and total visualized data) displays would enable users to more efficiently tackle core visualization tasks. Our hypotheses were largely motivated by prior experiments in the space. Our statistical analysis showed that performance, when scaled against the size of the visualization, did improve up until and including the 600MP display condition. However the hypothesis did not hold for the 1GP display condition. These results can be visually verified using VEEVVIE. In <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> we show results generated using VEEVVIE, by highlighting combinations of experimental conditions and looking at the distributions of the SET measurement. Notice the relatively clear boundary between the 100MP and 1GP populations but the much more diffuse distribution when looking at the 600MP and 1GP conditions. Similar visual patterns can be identified for most results of the statistical analysis. These patterns (and their outliers) motivate the insight gathering process. Visual hypothesis validation is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Case 2: Insight Gathering</head><p>During the visual analysis of the results of our study, we wanted to delve into the driving factors behind substantial differences in performance across our sample, particularly in the largest display condition, for which our analysis did not indicate an overall improvement in performance. Using the filtering controls, we narrow the data scope to <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>. Leveraging VEEVVIE for insight development. The interaction effect explorer points out a regression in scaled performance (SET) for the 1GP-VS independent variable level combination (a). This leads us to examine the worse-case performance across subjects and find exemplar good and poor performers (b). Sample physical navigation trajectories and presence heatmaps from the selected participants are visualized in (c). We notice that the good performer only navigates very little, standing near the center of the visualization space and only moving to confirm his response. Contrarily, the poor performer navigates much more as they frantically inspect individual columns of displays within the visualization facility, potentially resulting in poor performance.</p><p>the 1G display condition. Using the interaction effect explorer we can see that mean SET regressed for the VS task substantially. We further drill down in this particular task and attempt to understand this performance regression. The participant-centric visualizer widget offers a "compare against worse case" option which we leverage in order to quickly identify the most and least performant subjects in this experimental condition. We identify subjects 2 and 3 as being good performers and subjects 9 and 15 as performing poorly.</p><p>We then proceed to visualize the motion trajectories and presence heatmaps of these individuals. We observe that subjects 2 and 3 navigated substantially less. Contrarily, the poor performers travelled much more throughout the visualization facility, often several "rountrips" around the space and seemed to inspect individual columns of displays closely. This initial insight along with additional observations led the hypothesis generation use case that we describe below. A visual overview of this process is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5">Case 3: Hypothesis Generation</head><p>The statistical analysis reported a main effect of the display condition on the SMEQ metric. We begin by examining the significant difference between the 300MP and 1GP display conditions and drill down to the AS task. A scatterplot of SMEQ × TRAVEL shows that several participants exhibited high SMEQ measurements at the 1GP display condition. However, these measurements do not seem to tightly correlate with the amount of TRAVEL. In fact, we observe that several participants self-reported high SMEQ values (≈ 70 − 80) but within a wide range of physical navigation measurements (between 10m and 75m), all generated at the 1GP display condition. The three participants that generated those trials spanned a range of self-reported visualization experience (1, 2 and 5 on a 0 − 6 scale). The subject-centric visualizer indicated that their performance was worse than the average within that particular design cell. Looking across the rows of the <ref type="figure">Fig. 10</ref>. Illustration of the generation of a new hypothesis material using VEEVVIE. An SMEQ × TRAVEL scatterplot (a), highlighted per display condition (orange for 1GP, blue for 300MP) shows that the larger display condition three users (b) exhibited similarly high frustration for varying levels of physical navigation. Using the participant-centric visualizer we can observe that overall performance for all these subjects was below average (c). The physical movement of these frustrated performers (e) is contrasted with that of some other below-average performers that reported substantially lower SMEQ readings (d). The patterns in (d) are much simpler while the patterns in (e) appear substantially more involved, with users moving close to the displays. These different "strategies" in tackling the visual search problem and their correlation to user frustration can form the basis for a future experimental hypothesis.</p><p>visualizer, we also observe that these participants generally underperformed in the VS task across all display conditions.</p><p>By visualizing the movement trajectories we can see a clear difference in how the approach to the task affects user frustration. In this case, we contrast one of the participants that self-reported high frustration with the task versus another participant that reported lower than average frustration. The non-frustrated user preferred to look for targets that answered the task query by observing displays from a distance. However, the highly-frustrated participant approached the displays and basically aligned themselves with the columns of the facility, individually inspecting visualization glyphs in search of an answer. Both participants reported the same experience in visualization.</p><p>This leads us to believe that the strategy with which users tackle problems within large display environments might be highly correlated to their eventual frustration. In this case, neither participant had prior exposure to any large-scale visualization system. Both participants performed approximately the same. However, one "enjoyed" their time in the facility much more than the other and, consequently, would be more likely to use it in the future. Thus, we feel that a future experiment should investigate this interrelation between largedisplay strategies, user performance and frustration. This process of visually driven hypothesis generation using VEEVVIE is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>Through this paper, we introduced VEEVVIE, the Visual Explorer for Empirical Visualization, VR and Interaction Experiments. Our experience with VEEVVIE has allowed us to generate new insights and provided us with several investigative avenues for future research on human factors for large visualization systems. We hope to eventually release VEEVVIE to the visualization, VR and HCI communities so that our colleagues can utilize interactive visual analysis as a tool in their experimental processes.</p><p>We have identified several features that we would like to incor-porate or iterate upon in future versions of VEEVVIE. For example, the current filtering and highlighting functionality can be enhanced by providing users with an interface for managing complex queries. A technical shortcoming of our current architecture is that widgets can not inject HTML and CSS declaratively into the front-end (this can be done programmatically). We plan on remedying this in the future by allowing delegates to declare paths to HTML templates and stylesheets that VEEVVIE injects automatically. Additionally, visual analytics applications have sometimes offered domain-specific query languages which can allow expert uses to more quickly delve into sections of the data. The VEEVVIE ontology can be used to support such a DSL for experimental designs. We plan on expanding the functionality of the built-in visualization widgets and also incorporate new ones based on feedback. For example, we wish to investigate visualization alternatives for the subject selection view and the subject-centric visualizer, which can scale for large experiments. Additionally, the statistical effect explorer could be expanded to visually encode the size of the mean difference between treatments. Our current system is geared towards single-user experiments, since they are most commonly encountered in literature. While collaborative experiments could be modeled with small modifications to our ontology, we feel that their visualization presents unique challenges and would like to explore it in the future. Additionally, we wish to identify experimental designs that can not be captured by the existing VEEVVIE ontology, in an effort to make our contribution even more generalizable. Finally, we would like to investigate the applicability of VEEVVIE to other application domains, such as the evaluation of computer algorithms.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Diagram of the VEEVVIE ontology, denoting the relationships between classes.
