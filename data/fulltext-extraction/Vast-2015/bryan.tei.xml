			<abstract>
				<p>The Epidemic Simulation System (EpiSimS) is a scalable, complex modeling tool for analyzing disease within the United States. Due to its high input dimensionality, time requirements, and resource constraints, simulating over the entire parameter space is unfeasible. One solution is to take a granular sampling of the input space and use simpler predictive models (emulators) in between. The quality of the implemented emulator depends on many factors: robustness, sophistication, configuration, and suitability to the input data. Visual analytics can be leveraged to provide guidance and understanding of these things to the user. In this paper, we have implemented a novel interface and workflow for emulator building and use. We introduce a workflow to build emulators, make predictions, and then analyze the results. Our prediction process first predicts temporal time series, and uses these to derive predicted spatial densities. Integrated into the EpiSimS framework, we target users who are non-experts at statistical modeling. This approach allows for a high level of analysis into the state of the built emulators and their resultant predictions. We present our workflow, models, the associated system, and evaluate the overall utility with feedback from EpiSimS scientists.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Disease spread is a complex problem in today's globalized world. A number of factors influence a disease's impact, including transmission rate, incubation period, antiviral supplies, and population dynamics. Mosquito-borne illnesses such as chikungunya <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> have had recent outbreaks in North America, highlighting the need to understand the critical parameters in the spread of these diseases.</p><p>Simulation is one way to do this. The Epidemic Simulation System (EpiSimS) is a scalable, complex, agent-based model for simulating the spread of infectious diseases within the United States <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>. A single EpiSimS run generates a large set of temporal, geospatial, and multivariate data, and requires significant compute and time resources. Because of this, it is impractical to test over the entire parameter space. One solution is to take a discrete sampling of the input parameter space, and employ a simpler predictive model to fill in the gaps. Such "simulation of simulations" is sometimes called scientific emulation; the idea is that an emulator can map the high-dimensional inputs to outputs with a reasonable degree of confidence and without having to run full simulations.</p><p>In this paper, we are studying the feasibility of visual analytics in an emulation workflow. Informally, our workflow is: build an emulator, analyze the emulator, make a prediction, analyze the prediction. However, consider that a built emulator, defined as a predictive model, selected parameters, and input data, can be good or bad at making accurate predictions. Its output accuracy and confidence depends on many factors. Analytics help inform the user whether the emulator is suitable for running predictions. If the system indicates aspects of the emulator have issues, such as outlier data points, the user can modify or select a different model. When satisfied, the user makes predictions. Here the prediction is reviewed in relation to other runs in the dataset. In our view, the prediction itself is not the goal, but a place for more analysis.</p><p>In the context of EpiSimS, our motivation is to predict and analyze disease runs. EpiSimS scientists, while experts at disease simulation, are not statistical modeling (or even visualization) experts, thus they are good candidates for this system. We employ two main panels, one for emulation and one for prediction, integrated into the existing EpiSimS viewer application and focus on using simplified visuals that combine color, comparison, and interactivity. From the emulator panel, users build and analyze an emulator. The prediction panel is used for making predictions, both temporally and spatially, and is where the user can review the prediction's place in both input parameter and spatiotemporal output space. Specifically, our contributions can be summarized as follows: 3. Novel visual interfaces for building and analyzing emulators and their predictions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.</head><p>Integration into the visualization application for a large-scale, scientific simulation framework, specifically, EpiSimS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK</head><p>There are two main facets to this work. Disease simulation and visualization is the first, and EpiSimS is our particular flavor of it. The second is predictive and parameter space analytics.</p><p>EpiSimS and Disease Visualization EpiSimS is a large, discrete-event, agent-based model for disease spread within the United States. It is highly customizable, scales to large population and geographic sizes, and can implement a number of response mechanisms for disease mitigation such as school closures, antiviral stockpiles, and behavior modifications. For prior work, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22]</ref>. The work in this paper uses the chikungunya disease model from <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>, augmenting that system by extending the front end viewer and introducing the emulation workflow.</p><p>More generally, visual analytics plays an important tool in the study of disease spread. The time-dependent geographic nature of disease makes maps an effective method of showing overall diffusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>. A recent systematic review <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref> discusses many applications that utilize map views (and other techniques) for disease spread. A single geospatial mapping may be insufficient, however, of the parameters. This can happen if the input data is not fully ranked, which means there is insufficient data information to estimate the model. That is, the first several runs play the important role, and the others are approximate linear combinations of these. These other runs could not provide much information towards building the model.</p><p>To figure out which is the case, the user rebuilds the emulator after removing four high-influence runs and compares how the analytics have changed <ref type="figure">(Figure 9d-f</ref>). In the radar plot <ref type="figure">(Figure 9e</ref>), the R 2 value has increased slightly and the MSE value has decreased, both of which indicate an improved model. In other words, the removed runs' error residuals were outliers (the first reason in the list), and removing them made the emulator better.</p><p>The error residuals plot and the run chart also confirm this <ref type="figure">(Figure 9f and d)</ref>. Two of the removed runs were outliers, and the run chart displays a much smooth distribution of influences.</p><p>Since the runs were outliers, it suggests two things. First, removing them improved the emulators. Second, these outlier runs represent areas of the parameter space that need to be simulated more. If the user ran full EpiSimS simulations close to the outlier runs in the parameter space, then future emulators could include these runs with less issue.</p><p>If the runs were linear combinations of each other (the second possibility), that would mean that despite the large number of runs there was little variability in parameter space. The information needed to build the model was insufficient with this dataset, so more varied EpiSimS runs should be done over the whole of parameter space. In either case, an ideal model building analysis should have a smooth run bar without any dominating runs. When this happens, the R 2 and MSE values do not change too much when removing a single run from the input data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">USER FEEDBACK AND DISCUSSION</head><p>Ensuring that our workflow and components are intuitive and usable by the non-statistical experts of the EpiSimS team is a critical task. We did an initial demo of the system and workflow with the EpiSimS team, then supervised them as they walked through the use cases and played around with the system. This led to a first round of feedback. We recommended that the scientists play with and use the new panels while we implemented some of the initially suggested changes. Both supervised (where we observed and helped users) and unsupervised usage took place. Also during this time, the spatial analysis panel (Section 5.3) was developed and added to the application.</p><p>Aside from bug submissions, feedback was mostly qualitative. In our initial demo, we had to define terms like R 2 , so a Help overlay was added. Users were initially concerned about the subtle interplay of some metrics (such as analyzing the run influence chart in the second use case), and there was a small learning curve for users as they became accustomed to the system. However, users noted in follow-up evaluations that they were better able to understand the interface components as they became familiarized with the workflow. One noted that the visual display of statistical metrics (instead of raw numbers) helped simplify things. While our system did not completely alleviate the need to learn about the metrics, visualization eased the process. Users became proficient at being able to build emulators, analyze for outliers and recognize parameter space gaps, and make and analyze predictions. As a general feature in EpiSims development, users stated the new emulation capabilities would be beneficial for future studies. Normally, only a small number of input parameters are tested, and only one parameter is changed and analyzed for each run. By being able to load a granular parameter sampling and use emulation in between, users said in future studies they will be able to test over a higherdimensional parameter space.</p><p>Specifically regarding the emulator panel, one user remarked that it's good to easily see if runs are skewed to high influence, as they can quickly be verified as outliers. This helps determine if more varied full runs are needed to "fill in the gaps."</p><p>On the prediction panel, team members liked that they could analyze the predicted run both temporally, spatially, and in relation to other existing runs. One user noted "comparing a potential run to existing similar runs for the time series is useful, helps to understand the effect of the parameter settings." The predicted map views were said to be beneficial on an intuitive level, a sort of "sneak peak" into a prospective run's spread. When the spatial analysis panel was made available, one user said the ability to spatially compare an existing run to the prediction was a "very cool analysis tool, being able to see how they will look visually as compared to a real run." Users also liked that they could compare only existing runs if desired, omitting the prediction altogether. "This is something we could really leverage for future analysis," and has led to discussions about expanding the spatial analysis panel's capabilities.</p><p>Regarding current system limitations, evaluations touched on a number of areas. One things users wanted was to continually assess variable influences while iteratively building an emulator, like as is done in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. This would help better validate the chosen predictive model, and alleviate some parts of the subjective trial-anderror building process currently performed. Although users could see outlier runs for a built emulator and areas where predictions would probably perform poorly, one request was for an automated way to show and analyze parameter space gaps, such as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>. Users also wanted a system for highlighting correlations and significant results between panels.</p><p>The three predictive models we have implemented could also be more refined and studied quantitatively to see how well suited they are for EpiSimS data. For example, the nonparametric model's predicted time series curve is equal on both sides. Although this works well for our particular EpiSimS chikungunya dataset, this is not always the case (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>, where the time series can have multiple humps). New models can be easily integrated into our system and workflow, but this is an ongoing research topic. Similarly, our spatial predictor may not perform as well if the geographic disease spread is more stochastic and/or subtle. Future EpiSimS datasets will have to do accuracy analysis to ensure the spatial predictor is feasible. Finally, we note that our panels could have scalability issues on larger datasets containing thousands of runs over hundreds of parameters. For this dataset of seven parameters and 100 runs, it's not an issue, but too many runs and/or parameters would make the bar charts insufficient visualization techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper we describe a novel emulator workflow and visual analytics interface. We combine a number of statistical metrics, interactions, predictive models, a novel spatial predictor, and visualization techniques for emulator building, usage, and analysis.</p><p>Our approach utilizes main two panels: one for emulators and one for predictions. The emulator panel is useful for showing the overall state of a built emulator. The prediction panel is used for making and analyzing potential simulation runs, letting a user explore both output and input space. We also developed a spatial analytics view to let a user geographically compare two runs.</p><p>We validate our design through two use case scenarios and feedback from users. We also discuss and justify our spatial predictor.</p><p>Possible future work includes integrating feedback obtained from users, mostly concerned with helping users understand the large number of statistical metrics and their sometimes subtle relationships with each other, as well as giving users better analysis of input parameter space. We are also considering adding more predictive models to our system, and performing a quantitative study of their predictive ability.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Index Terms: D.2.2 [Software]: Software Engineering-User Interfaces; G.3 [Mathematics of Computing]: Probability and Statistics-Time series analysis; H.5.2.
