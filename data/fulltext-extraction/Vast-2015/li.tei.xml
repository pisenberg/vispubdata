<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The rapid growth of the computer game industry has driven innovation in hardware development, which ranges from new desktop graphics hardware to powerful mobile and handheld game devices that support increasingly compelling computer games with extravagant scenarios and high resolution. Many factors may contribute to player performance and gaming experience, including resolution, network latency, and frame rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>. Analyzing each of these factors carefully to determine their overall impact on game playability is both essential and meaningful. This paper focuses on frame rate, which is a key parameter that affects both game smoothness and immersion. Although maximizing frame rate is appropriate and even advantageous, increasing frame rate is frequently achieved at the expense of reducing resolution, which decreases the sharpness of game images. Moreover, the wide variety of game hardware, which is mainly attributed to the influences of GPU, CPU, and RAM, results in the same game being played over a range of frame rates. Considering all these factors, game platform designers and developers are striving to combine available hardware capabilities with an ad hoc understanding of the effects of frame rate on game play to provide smooth or sharp images in computer games. Unlike other technical solutions, we perform a visual analytics method to manage frame rate data. However, developing such methods to satisfy the requirement is a highly challenging task. Firstly, game performance analyses are becoming increasingly important and complex because of many factors and the scale of data collected from real gaming environment. Secondly, simply identifying frame rate data patterns is insufficient. The overall quantitative measurement of game performance and a comparison between two game tests are also essential to game designers and developers because they need to be aware of whether a game is on its way to improving its per-formance and providing smooth gaming experiences.</p><p>To address the aforementioned issues, we present a practical solution for quantitative visual analysis to identify results from different game performance optimization channels, such as providing optimization from engineering programs, alternating map resources, and amending play rules by designers, among others. Consequently, the proposed solution is useful to: (1) game analysts to make recommendations on graphic card purchases and on adjusting game display settings whenever appropriate from the angle of data level; (2) game designers to improve and optimize game map design, gameplay rules, and the position collocation of nonplayer characters (NPCs); and (3) game developers to track the performances of different computer graphics cards and potential programming bugs that may affect gaming experience, as well as compare overall game performance between two game tests to determine whether performance has improved or degraded. We first analyze the problem with the aid of a game designer, developer, and user experience engineer to identify relevant analytical tasks. Then, we construct processing steps to detect performance ad hoc as well as player display setting changes in a game scenario. Afterward, we develop the proposed visualization modules and refine their visual designs with the aid of game researchers. Lastly, to evaluate our visual analytics framework, we apply our system to a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) operated by NetEase Games 1 , one of the largest game companies in China. To our knowledge, our work is the first to help designers visually analyze patterns of game performance data and identify game performance results in a quantitative manner. It is also the first to allow users to interactively trace and target possible reasons from the complex distribution of game performance data across time and space. Our work presents three technical contributions: (1) A comprehensive visual analytics framework that rapidly conveys the salient aspects of the implied patterns of game performance data across time and space, while simultaneously maintaining sufficient context and space to help users examine, adjust, and identify overall performance; (2) an iterative and progressive visual analysis method, as well as an active cooperation and feedback system between designers and developers, which enables smooth communication between visualization and the game performance analysis model via interactions; and (3) real-world game scenarios cases.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Game Performance Study</head><p>Factors such as resolution, network latency, and frame rate, affect player gaming experience. In this work, we focus on frame rate data. Most intuition in the effects of frame rates on games is based on studies on perceived video quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>, which examine the effects of frame rate on users who are passively watching streaming videos. Other studies measure user ability to learn from such videos <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. However, watching videos, even those that involve interactions such as a videoconference, does not require the same interaction as games. Claypool, et al. provide a unique classification scheme for actions in first-person shooter games based on interaction requirements that enable qualitative assessments of the effect of frame rates on player performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>. These studies generally draw their conclusion based on the relationship between user performance and the scale of frame rates and basically focus on different effects of interactions on frame rates, but none quantitatively examines the overall effect of frame rates on game performance in detail. Most employ statistical methods or basic infographics and focus on presenting static information without considering their dynamical attributes. Other technical reports focus on hardware performance analysis. In this paper, we propose a visual analytical approach that integrates in-depth analysis and intuitive visualiza- <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> http://game.163.com/ tion into a comprehensive solution for quantitative measurement in game performance analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Visualization of Gameplay Data</head><p>Wallner provides a literature review of gameplay data based on visual analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>. The first issue that should be considered when designing a visualization scheme for a computer game is its target audience and users. In this paper, the target users of our system are the development team and game analysts. Therefore, techniques derived from software visualization may be appropriate. Wallner et al. propose PLATO for time-dependent and multidimensional gameplay data <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>. However, unlike our work that is designed particularly for certain analysis tasks, the work of Wallner et al. integrates many perspectives. Dinara et al. visualize the behavior of players in video games to discover patterns and support aggregation and comparison <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. Their visualization scheme primarily consists of basic views. The methods used in games, including multidimensional graphs and even text visualization techniques, may become prevalent in the near future <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>. Another closely related and emerging topic is visualization for sports. Sports share similar characteristics with games in terms of data, such as the target audience and questions that the audience may ask. Medler draws connections between the collection of statistics from sports and computer games <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>. Systems such as TenniVis <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> have begun to emerge. Recently, Cox and Stasko use information visualization to discover hidden meanings in baseball season data using bar displays and treemaps <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Gameplay data generally involves both spatial and temporal elements and these have been extensively studied. Except for linear time or periodical time, which has been discussed extensively <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23]</ref>, a stacked graph and its variants <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> are popular methods for simultaneously visualizing changes in multiple attributes over time. Compared metaphorically to a river, a flow map is yet another effective visualization technique that is commonly employed to show the movement of objects from one location to another or to many destinations. A preceding work is proposed to connect origins and destinations using lines and arrows, and the width or color of lines to reveal flow volume <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>. However, this approach has several shortcomings. First, visual clutter easily occurs when applied to a large data set or one with complex patterns. Second, flow lines can easily overlap with others. Many methods, such as spatial generalization and aggregation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref> and edge bundling <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> have been proposed to reduce the number of location pairs before visualization. In our work, we also adopt a stacked graph and extend it with a flow map with a parallel isotime style to handle complex analytical tasks. With regard to the spatial component of the data, the most common means used to present geographical information are maps and their variants (e.g., heat map). Many methods have been proposed for applications in various fields that have to encode both temporal and spatial changes into a single and integrated display or multiple linked views <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> to detect potential spatiotemporal correlations in the data. Given that our proposed system is designed to handle multiple analytical tasks, we adopt the link/view scheme. Inspired by these spatial and temporal visualization techniques, we apply some similar designs, but encode different attributes based on our game scenarios. In this paper, we analyze game performance data, which differ from player behavior data, and use visual analytics methods under a macro-perspective to quantitatively evaluate the performance of games and the gaming experience of players to help designers and developers target potential problems and make sound and timely decisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">DATA AND TASK ABSTRACTION</head><p>In this paper, we focus on game performance data adopted from an online MMORPG. To ensure the gaming experience of mainstream players and test the gaming fluency of the target computer hardware configuration, we focus on NV IDIAGT X650 and the RAM ranging from 3000 to 10000. The marking criterion of this GPU is 1832 based on the latest GPU benchmark 2 . We do not consider the detailed information of players (such as the player score/life/energy). As in a MMORPG game, these variables are mainly determined by players' operation skills, rather than the game fluency. Therefore, the overall game scenario performance is defined mainly by the frame rate data, and we arrange them in Format A: (playerid, timestamp, display setting, position x , postion y , f ps), which are collected at an interval of 1.5 minutes. To compare performance difference between two tests, we collect data from the two tests and summarize them in Format B: position x , position y , display setting, last test info ( f ps 1 : f req 1 , f ps 2 : f req 2 , ...), this test info ( f ps 1 : f req 1 , f ps 2 : f req 2 , ...).</p><p>We closely work with a game designer; a game developer, in charge of optimizing game engines; and a game data analyst. We hold several discussions to establish the design objective of our system and reach a consensus that providing a useful summary with clear visual clues as an overview of game performance is necessary or even essential. To further explore interactively, the different aspects of frame rate data should be analyzed. The quantitative measurement of game scenario performance should be provided based on user interactions and certain parameter settings. In summary, we identify a set of basic and common analytical tasks that are expected to be provided by our system, which are listed as follows: [T.1] Statistical analysis and overview of game scenario performance: Analyze the overall distribution of frame rate data; [T.2] Effects of design patterns on game performance in different regions of a scenario: For a specific geographic region, determine its game performance and its similarities with other regions, since the game scenario is composed by different "trunks" ("trunk" is referred to a grid element in game programming context) and the performance varies among different "trunks". [T.3] Analysis of temporal patterns: Analyze display setting evolution, detect potential patterns (how and when players subjectively adjust their gaming settings), identify spatiotemporal correlations with players' positions, and reveal possible interrelations among different display settings and frame rate levels; [T.4] Performance comparison: Compare the performance between different game tests, and quantitatively measure game performance in order to offer suggestions to designers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">VISUALIZATION DESIGN</head><p>To satisfy these requirements, we carefully select the visualization techniques and extend those that are well established, which can be easily understood by users. Our system has four major views: the frame rate, FootRiver, grid, and comparison views. In this section, we describe our visualization design for each view in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Frame Rate View</head><p>The frame rate view enables users to grasp the overall characteristics of a series of time frames and facilitate the interactions of these time frames to adjust the final results. First, we divide the game scenario map into grid elements with the same fixed size. Then, we normalize all frame rate values with different coordinates into grid elements. We use the average frame rate to represent the value of a grid element, and then map the value to a single warm color to represent a low frame rate and to a cool color to represent a high one. In reality, the game scenario is composed of "trunks" with different sizes, however, we cannot determine the specific size of trunks. In order to simplify the problem, we divide the game scenarios into grid elements. Considering the different sizes of game scenario maps, users should be able to adjust grid element size to check the performance of each grid element. Furthermore, not all grid elements should be considered if the sampling number within <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/gpulist.php. it is not statistically meaningful. We provide users with the freedom to control sampling threshold. Besides, to present how players move on one time frame to the next, we encode the pairwise "fromto" as red and green dots and the trajectories are represented by moving yellow arrows starting from the "from" places to the "to" places, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">FootRiver View</head><p>The FootRiver view reveals the temporal patterns of the frame rate level with the changes in display settings, and potential spatiotemporal correlations in gaming process evolution. We initially divide frame rate values into three levels based on the following criteria:</p><p>(1) the visual retention time of human eyes (0.1s-0.4s, that is, if the shooting speed of play is less than 10 f ps, then a lag phrase will occur); (2) the national standard of TV broadcast frame rate is 25 f ps; and (3) the highest frame rate of current mainstream displays is 60 f ps. In particular, (1) f ps ∈ (0, 10): Obvious lag of a game. Players cannot accept this situation, with no feeling of smoothness;</p><p>(2) f ps ∈ <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr">25)</ref>: No obvious lag phrase. Players can marginally accept it; and (3) f ps ∈ (26, 60): No lag phrase. Players enjoy a smooth gaming experience. In online gaming, lag is a noticeable delay between the action of players and the reaction of the server. Although lag may be caused by high latency, it may also occur due to insufficient processing power in the client and a low f ps value. A low frame rate would make the game less responsive to updates and may force it to skip outdated data <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Apart from the frame rate level, the display setting can also varies along with time steps. Players may proactively adjust the default display setting if they are experiencing a lag phrase. Game designers are interesting in whether the default game display setting is appropriate. Thus, we combine the frame rate levels and display settings to generate layers. In this paper, we divide the frame rate levels into 3 categories. The display settings provided for players have only 3 options: "high", "median", and "low". Therefore, the number of the whole layers here is 9. To present these changes, we discuss several candidate designs. However, since we should simultaneously display the changes of total number of online players and provide information of how players change from one particular gaming condition to another, we choose to integrate a flow map visualization in ThemeRiver <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> fashion, rather than using link and view scheme and propose the FootRiver view ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3)</ref>: (1) Layers: we encode each gaming condition as a node and assign in a parallel manner. The size of the node represents the number of players arrived. The links between nodes show the migration of players under different gaming conditions, and their weights indicate the number of migrations. The changes in area size under different gaming conditions are depicted using ThemeRiver, whereas additional details of migration changes are encoded as threads placed on the layers. After that, we adjust positions of the nodes within the same gaming condition generated in the parallel manner and embed them into the layers. (2) Threads: in each layer, the highlighted threads are drawn to depict major migration changes in the corresponding nodes in adjacent time frames when selecting a certain gaming condition. However, neighboring branches may overlap. To resolve this issue, we adjust the order of each thread in each node. Threads are arranged based on the order of their destination nodes, and they occupy the corresponding spaces of the starting node in proportion to the weight, and the coordinate (c ix , c iy ) of link i is determined by Eq. 1:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">c ix = (x down + x up )/2 c iy = y up + (y down − y up )/(num * 2) + shi f t i−1<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where (x down , y down ) and (x up , y up ) are the coordinates of node n and shi f t</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">i (shi f t i = l i * (y down − y up )/(num) + shi f t i−1 )</formula><p>is the offset of link i from the top position of node n and l i−1 is the transition number represented by link i − 1. (3) Transition Curves: to provide an overview of changes of players' subjectively adjusting the display settings, we design a transition curve. The height at each time epoch encodes the transition rate (the ratio of the sum of the total number of all display setting transitions and the original number), as indicated in Eq. 2:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">h x = ( n ∑ i=1 N link i ∑ j=1 l j num )/( n ∑ i=1 n i num )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>in which h x is the the x th timestamp and n i num is the total number of the display setting node n i . N link j is the number of links where the father node is n i and l j num is the transition number from n to other nodes in the next timestep. In our case, we render three transition curves, representing the transitions in three situations (from level 1 to level 2 or level 3, from level 2 to level 1 or 3, and from level 3 to level 1 or 2). (4) Lost players: at each timestamp, some players would exit the game. We depict the numbers of lost players in ellipses and encode them in the bottom of each layer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Grid View</head><p>Game designers are concerned about the similarities among grid elements when designing a new game scenario because the specific performances of different grid elements ("trunks") vary. Grid elements are essentially high dimensional data and plenty of similarity metrics are available to measure similarities among high dimensional data. The traditional distance functions are Euclidean distance, Chebychev distance, Manhattan distance, Minkowski Distance, Weighted Minkowski Distance, Mahalanobis distance, and the cosine measure, etc. Based on different applications, we choose different distance functions. The difficulty in similarity measurement in a high-dimensional space not only lies on the complexity of the algorithm, what's more, is to obtain a meaningful result. As the traditional measure algorithms are mostly based on the spatial distance, the results obtained in the high-dimensional space are often meaningless <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6]</ref>. In this paper, we modify the original distance measurement function to alleviate and eliminate the impact that high dimensions bring. Suppose each data object has M dimensions, and namely two data objects:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">x i = (x i1 , x i2 , ..., x iM ) and x j = (x j1 , x j2 , ..., x jM ).</formula><p>In traditional similarity measurements, the contribution of each dimension of data objects is equal. We use Eq. 3 to define the dissimilarity between two objects, which normalizes the scale of similarity of each dimension between data objects to the scope between 0 and 1. Therefore, compared with the traditional Euclidean distance to calculate similarity, Eq. 3 reduces the overwhelming effect of a single dimension.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">d(x i , y j ) = 1 − M ∑ k=1 1 1 + x ik − x jk</formula><p>(3) <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: Sampling numbers are encoded as different colors and the "smoothness" of the f ps distribution is encoded as glyph shape.</p><p>After determining the similarity values between any two existing grid elements and the statistical values of each grid element, we map all grid elements using heat map in the grid view ((b) grid view in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). All the grid elements in the frame rate view lie along the x axis and the y axis determines f ps values (ranging from 1 to 60). The color of the heat map shows the number in the corresponding f ps and the grid element. We adopt a point-based display with each point representing a grid element and the relative distance representing similarity. This scheme, which can be easily understood and exhibits good scalability, is widely used in many visualization systems. Thus, the similarity of each grid element is represented as a high-dimensional vector</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">(d i,1 , d i,2 , d i,i−1 , d i,i+1 , ..., d i,n )</formula><p>where n is the number of all grid elements. d i, j represents the value of similarity measurement between grid element i and grid element j. Through Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), the grid element corresponding to the vector</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">m i = (d i,1 , d i,2 , d i,i−1 , d i,i+1 , ..., d i,n )</formula><p>can be mapped to a point in the scatter plot. The distance between each pair of points encodes the similarity between the corresponding pairs of grid elements. We design a grid glyph <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4)</ref> to encode the detailed f ps distribution of a grid element. The sampling number of a grid element is encoded by different colors as using the visual clue of size may cause overlap, and the "smoothness" of the f ps distribution with the shape of the glyph. To differentiate grid elements with varying sampling numbers, we modify the radius of the glyph when hovering on the glyph: the longer the radius, the larger the sampling number. To present grid elements with different f ps distributions, we divide the outer circle into 60 equal parts, and the geometry of the curve shape is further employed in the glyph. The "smoothness" for each f ps value is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">s i = radius * v i v max ∼ s i = radius * (∑ i j=1 v j ) v max<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where radius means the size of the grid glyph, v i is the sampling number of the corresponding f ps and v max is the largest sampling number of all f ps values. Through experiments, we find that applying the cumulative percentage to replace the absolute values of the sampling number has considerably more intuitive effects (Eq. 4). Suppose the coordinate of the grid glyph i is (x i ,y i ), then, the specific coordinate c i of f ps i is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">c ix = x i + s i * sin((i + 1) * PI/30 c iy = y i − s i * cos((i + 1) * PI/30<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Through the scatter plot layout (See an example of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 5</ref>), users can easily observe the clusters of sampling number and the similar distributions of grid elements and outliers, which is an important and common analytical task in game scenario map design (T.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Comparison View</head><p>Comparison view visualizes the difference between two separate game tests and provides a quantitative assumption about game performance changes, which assists users in exploring additional details of game performance improvement or degradation through interactions. For each grid element, we use the arithmetic mean to represent the performance difference. By considering the unbalanced distribution of samplings in different grid elements, the overall performance is defined in Eq. 6:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">f ps k = n ∑ m=1 ( num m N * f ps m )<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where num m represents the number of sampling in grid element m and N indicates the total number of sampling in the game test k, and n is the number of all grid elements that are being considered.</p><p>To help users determine how the performance difference changes with different size of grid element and sampling thresholds, we fix several sampling thresholds (10, 50, 100, ..., 400), perform loop iterations for different grid element sizes ranging from 1 to 200 (in some scenarios, the range is from 1 to 100 depending on the size of the game scenario) and calculate each result of game performance difference. Then, we need a solution to determine specific and exact performance differences (T.4). We must first perform a correlation analysis between the two selected difference curves based on user interactions. If the curves are strongly correlated with each other, then they are unrelated to the sampling thresholds, and we can use the average value of all the performance differences of each corresponding grid element to represent the final quantitative measurement. However, some deviation values may reflect the average level of game difference, and thus, influence the correlation between the two performance difference curves. Determining whether such deviation values will affect the correlation index among samples have been studied extensively in meteorological statistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>. The most common methods adopted are using scatter plots and moving correlation analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>. Analyzing the correlation in a scatter plot is a simple and intuitive process; however, it requires human subjective judgment. The moving correlation method has been used extensively in stock analysis; however, the outliers may affect correlation analysis results and cause users to draw false conclusions. We propose a correlation coefficient analysis method based on interactive recursive deletion to objectively and quantitatively determine whether an inappropriate grid element size may lead to a considerable variation in the correlation coefficients between the two performance difference samples selected by users. Unlike in related previous works, we involve users in the visual exploration and iteration processes.</p><p>Step 1: suppose the selected two performance difference samples are X = (x 1 , x 2 , ..., x n ) and Y = (y 1 , y 2 , ..., y n ). We use the Pearson correlation coefficient to measure the correlation (r(X,Y )) between X and Y.</p><p>Step 2: for each element in X = (x 1 , x 2 , ..., x n ) and Y = (y 1 , y 2 , ..., y n ), we remove the i th (i = 1, 2, ..., n) pair of elements (x i , y i ) and name the remaining n − 1 pairs of sample data X i = X x i and Y i = Y y i and the corresponding correlation coefficient is r i = r(X i ,Y i ). After n times of deletions, we construct an correlation coefficient array, which is recorded as (r 1 , r 2 , ..., r n ).</p><p>Step 3: to ensure that the correlation coefficient array follows Gaussian distribution, we perform fisher-Z transformation for each element in r i = (r 1 , r 2 , ..., r n ) and obtain r f = (r f 1 , r f 2 , ..., r f n ). Furthermore, in order to facilitate the subsequent calculations, we apply Z-score normalization to r f and obtain rz = (rz i , rz 2 , ..., rz n ).</p><p>Step 4: after obtaining rz = (rz i , rz 2 , ..., rz n ), we successively remove the i th element in rz, and generate the variance v r i of the remaining n − 1 values.</p><p>Step 5: construct χ 2 statistics to test whether the volatility of v has changed. For each element in v, we examine whether the difference between v r i and v r = 1 is significant. The traditional approach is to provide significance level α, and then conduct χ 2 testing for each value in v. If the corresponding χ i 2 statistics of s r i is in the rejection region, then we reject the original hypothesis and conclude that when removing rz i , the volatility of correlation coefficient array rz is significantly changed. That is, the sample pair (x i , y i ) significantly affect the correlation coefficient r of the whole samples. Instead, we provide interactions to assist users refine the aforementioned outliers rather than encapsulating all detected outliers in the black box.</p><p>Step 6: when users remove a outlier, we obtain a new pair of sample curves, namely, X i = X x i and Y i = Y y i . and repeat the preceding steps until no significant volatility exists. The final correlation coefficient we obtain could be considered as the reliable fact of the two selected game performance difference curves. Once we obtain a reliable correlation coefficient between the two selected performance differences, we use the average of the corresponding difference of all the remaining grid elements to represent the final game difference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Interactions</head><p>Users can filter data by selecting different display settings, timestamp, grid element size, and sampling threshold. Besides, our system provides users with the following interactions to assist them in performing comprehensive analyses: Brushing/Linking: users can brush in the frame rate view to detect a specific grid element and view the distribution of values. In FootRiver view, users can select any layer or node along the time axis to check transition from one gaming condition to another. In grid view, the distribution of grid elements can be brushed. Besides, the system supports automatic linking among proposed views. When users choose a grid glyph in the grid view, the corresponding grid element will be highlighted; or when a node or a thread is brushed in the FootRiver view, the frame rate view will update to show the geographic distribution and the migration from one timestamp to the next. Since all the views are closely linked, it is fairly easy to select any wanted grid elements according its attributes. Iteration/Feedback: we integrate interactive recursive deletion based on the correlation analysis into the user intuitive interface. When users compare two game performance difference curves, the original correlation coefficient, the variance view and the χ 2 view display the corresponding results of the interactive selection and deletion of the users, which would simultaneously affect the original comparison views. Users can repeatedly follow a detection-deletion interaction until they eventually obtain a stable game performance difference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CASE STUDIES</head><p>In this section, we demonstrate the usage and effectiveness of our visual analytics system through three cases that explore game performance data using our interface as well as through feedbacks from game designers, developers, and analysts. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Newbie Scenario Performance Analysis</head><p>The first case study illustrates how to interactively analyze game performance of a newbie scenario in an online MMORPG. A newbie scenario is a slang term for the first scenario of a novice or newcomer to a game. This scenario plays an important role in determining retention rate/churn rate and determines the first impression of players. We have collected the first day's data since game released and over 220000 logs from over 12000 game players have been recorded for analysis. From the frame rate view and the grid view, we can see some locations where a large bunch of players gathering outstand themselves from others. We also find a gap near the position of 10 fps <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1(b)</ref> in yellow retangle). That's because when the value drops to 10, players are out of control and the game is automatically changed to an on-hook state, which will not be explained as real frame rate data. Although 10 fps is considered as an on-hook value, many samples with frame rates lower than 10 fps remain, particularly in level 1. In the grid view, grid elements are scattered in the MDS scatter plot, in which the fps sampling number in each grid element largely determines their positions with respect to one another (T.2). We separately show the scatter plot with different display settings: level 1 has a more cluttered distribution, different from level 2 and level 3. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 5</ref>, AOI 1 has less fps sampling numbers and the responding areas in the scenario are shown in the frame rate view, encoded by yellow rectangles. AOI 2, on the other side, gathers a large population of players and their positions all occupy the main areas of the scenario. From the scatter plot, it is quite easy to observe the areas with high density players or open areas. Meanwhile, we also clearly observe some deviation grid elements, such as AOI 3. The detailed distribution of AOI 3 is largely different from those of others, in which fps 1 occupies the largest portion and overwhelms the other fps values. Other deviation grid elements including CP1 and CP2, of which the cumulative percent of relatively lower fps values (less than fps 30) determines over a portion of 80%, and while in the main pattern (CP3 and CP4), the fps value of 60 occupies nearly 20% of all samplings <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 6</ref>). <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>: Transition trajectories from players' positions at the previous timestamp to the next positions through clicking the transition threads in the FootRiver view and the corresponding trajectories will be plotted in the frame rate view.</p><p>Next, we move to explore the spatio-temporal patterns. We find that game players mainly adjust the display settings in the first five steps (see the transition curves in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1 (b)</ref>). If we take a deep look at different gaming condition layers, we find some interesting patterns. As show in <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>, the main transitions happened in layer 2-1, 2-2, 1-3, and 2-3. When the fps level is relatively low, and if the corresponding display setting is high (median or high), players will proactively adjust their display settings to a lower level (from layer 1-3, 2-3 to layer 2-1 or 3-1; from 1-3, 2-3 to layer 2-2 or 3-2, etc.). However, the transition threads between layers of different display settings are few and mainly distributed in the first several timestamps. The mainstream transitions happen in the same display setting layers but vary among different fps levels. By plotting those players in the transition threads on the geographic scenario and dynamically visualizing their transition trajectories from their positions at the last timestamp to the positions at the next timestamp ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 7)</ref>, we find that most trajectories happen in the birth places of this scenario. Therefore, as for the newbie scenario, the key issue to improve the scenario performance is to distribute the large population of players that rush into from the entrance equally.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Instance Dungeon Performance Analysis</head><p>An instance dungeon, which typically exists in MMO games, is a special area that generates a new copy of the location for each group or for players entering the area <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>. This place typically gathers a massive number of players to repeatedly enter and exit. For this case, we have a total number of over 6800 logs from 3624 game players recorded. Loading frame rate data and observing the frame rate view is the first step for analysts to explore data using FPSSeer (T.1). In this step, we can try different grid element sizes and sampling thresholds to determine the overall distribution of frame rate data in a game scenario. Most regions have a high frame rate, approximately 40 fps. The MDS scatter plot presents all the samples in an intuitive manner, with colors representing the sampling number in the plot. By clicking on the scatter plot, the corresponding item would be highlighted. Although a thick crowd is found in dense areas, game performance is relatively good. However, at the entrance of such scenario, the distribution of the sample is slightly different from those in other dense areas, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 9</ref>. We find numerous fps values that are approximately 1, which is totally unacceptable for players to continue playing. The game designers explain the reason for such a finding as follows: numerous resources in the entrance have to be loaded from disks to construct the scenario. And the game developer responsible for engine optimization will continue to optimize the performance of the scenario entrance and preload the required resources.</p><p>We move to analyze how players subjectively adjust the display settings (T.3) and find that nearly all the fluctuations happened within the same display setting but among adjacent frame rate levels, which means the overall gaming experiences are smooth. In <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>: FootRiver view to show the main transitions happened in layer 2-1, 2-2, 1-3, and 2-3. When the fps level is relatively low, and if the corresponding display setting is high (median or high), players will proactively adjust their display settings to a lower level (from layer 1-3, 2-3 to layer 2-1 or 3-1; from 1-3, 2-3 to layer 2-2 or 3-2, etc.). addition, we find several cases of adjustment between different display settings, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 10</ref>. After checking the trajectories in the frame rate view, we divide them into two categories: those move forward would adjust the display setting higher, while those move backward to the entrance (birth place) will adjust lower. The game analysts conclude that when moving forward to the next waypoint, there are few monsters blocking the path. However, when moving backward, the only explanation is that the role is killed and return back to the birth place, and before that, there are many monsters and game special effects that will affect the frame rate, making players subjectively adjust the display setting lower. Thus, in this instance dungeon, we conclude the main factor that contributes to the overall performance is the game resources, including the number of monsters and the game special effects. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Game Downtown Performance Comparison</head><p>Game downtown is a representative area for game performance analysis, in which a large population gathering and trading. Unlike other scenarios, game downtown keeps a stable stream of players, thus often considered as a symbol of game performance optimization. We collect the data from two separate game tests and arrange them in Format B. There are about 25000 and 40000 sampling numbers collected from the two game tests, respectively. We use comparison view to compare the performance difference. The difference heat map shows the performance difference in each grid element. We can interactively check up on each grid element to get its sampling numbers, average fps values and the performance difference. For example, when we select the entrance of this game downtown scenario, the game performance improvement is witnessed, rising from about 28.46 fps to 32.69 fps. However, the detailed distribution of fps values in this grid element tells us that about 50% of samplings are below 20 fps, and there is a huge rise on the 20 fps in the cumulative percentage. Game analysts conclude that the resources loading may contribute to this phenomenon. Besides, game designers also want to know the areas which share poor performance, which have been improved or degraded under a controllable standard between the two tests to quickly localize the areas. We provide them with such an intuitive comparison, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 11</ref>. We continue to quantitatively analyze the performance difference (T.4). In general, we can easily detect which locations experience an improved or degraded performance through the performance difference heat map. However, we have to adjust different parameters (size of grid element, sampling threshold, etc.) with domain knowledge to get an appropriate value. The correlation coefficient analysis method based on interactive recursive deletion helps us to refine the final result. We first select two performance difference curves generated with different parameters of grid element size and sampling threshold, and the quantitative measurement (correlation coefficient/variance/χ 2 test views) simultaneously present the results based on our selection <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 12)</ref>. Based on the χ 2 test view, grid element 5 exhibits the largest fluctuation. We then delete the corresponding value of grid element 5 by right-clicking the value, which would iteratively affect the selected performance difference curves. And the quantitative measurement views will be refreshed once more. After removing several outliers, the χ 2 test view becomes stable. We can repeatedly continue the preceding operations, until eventually obtain a result of the game performance difference by averaging all the performance differences of the corresponding remaining values. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref>: Users can interactively refine outliers (remove grid element 5, and 95) and check up on whether exists significant volatility. If not, then a reliable correlation coefficient is obtained to calculate the final game performance difference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Experts Review and Discussion</head><p>We demonstrate our system to a chief game designer, a game developer and a game data analyst to obtain feedbacks. We firstly explain our system workflow and visual encoding method, and then show how to target problems. All three experts are impressed with our system and regard it as a useful tool. They comment that the visual analytics approach to data could intuitively display the gathering places of players in each timestamp as well as their proactive adjustment of display settings, which can offer significant suggestions for game scene optimization/scenario design/game task line design/NPC distribution. The game programmer responsible for optimizing game engine performance appreciates the conclusions drawn from FPSSeer, especially the quantitative measurement of game performance difference. The findings obtained by our system are backed up by the facts he has already known through players' feedback from game forums/one-on-one telephone interviews/questionnaire data. The expert recommends our way as a standard and regular job to evaluate game performance in the follow-up tests. He agrees on that our system has met his requirements for an objective evaluation of engine performance from the data level. Finally, the chief game designer comments that in the follow-up, we should further control the freedom of each variable, and consider other relevant factors that may influence game performance. There are some lessons that should be learned through the collaboration with industrial experts. Users with little backgrounds on visualization often have difficulty in understanding some complicated visual designs. They are used to various data analysis reports that only present the final conclusions. Therefore, how to involve them in the interactive exploration is challenging. Therefore, we choose some well-established techniques and extend them to meet our special business requirements. Also in industry, webbased applications may be much more convenient compared with our desktop application, since we have to prepare the data beforehand, sometimes making the communication complicated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper presents a collaborative work with game personnel to help them analyze factors that may influence gaming experiences and quantify performance difference between game tests. We first define the analytical tasks, and then present FPSSeer to facilitate analysis for game performance data. Several well-established visualization techniques are extended and integrated into our system. We also propose an interactive approach for users to quantitatively and objectively measure performance difference. We demonstrate the usability and effectiveness through real-world case studies. Multiple avenues are available for future work. At present, we ignore some factors that may influence game performance to simplify the problem and plan to introduce these factors to extend our system, collect more feedback from end users and conduct controlled experiments to further improve our system.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>(a) frame rate view with grid element size of 5 and sampling threshold of 10; (b) grid element size of 10 and sampling threshold of 10; (c) Player transitions between adjacent time frames representing by moving blue arrows.
