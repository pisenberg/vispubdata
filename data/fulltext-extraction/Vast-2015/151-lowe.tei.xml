				<p>Order selection of autoregressive processes is an active research topic in time series analysis, and the development and evaluation of automatic order selection criteria remains a challenging task for domain experts. We propose a visual analytics approach, to guide the analysis and development of such criteria. A flexible synthetic model generator-combined with specialized responsive visualizations-allows comprehensive interactive evaluation. Our fast framework allows feedback-driven development and fine-tuning of new order selection criteria in real-time. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach in three use-cases for two general as well as a real-world example.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The goal of time series analysis is to find an adequate model for given time series data. The most attention in time series literature has been devoted to autoregressive (AR) models <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. In many application areas-such as speech analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, biomedical engineering <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, or EEG <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>-AR processes are used for prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> or classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> of time series data. However, determining an appropriate AR process from given data remains a challenging task for domain experts <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>In an AR process of order p, each value depends linearly on the previous p values. The main difficulty thereby is to select the correct order, and many order selection criteria (information criteria) have been proposed for this task. These criteria are widely used in practice, but determining which criterion performs best for given conditions has to be done for each scenario individually <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>.</p><p>While there have been empirical studies investigating the performance of order selection criteria, these studies were performed on a very limited number of AR processes-sometimes even individual processes. These studies mostly investigate the behavior of selection criteria for many different time series data sets (realizations) of the same AR process.</p><p>In practice, however, the underlying AR process is typically not known or does not exist and, thus, an evaluation is required that samples from a comprehensive set of possible AR processes. Additionally, we have to take into account many factors that influence the behavior of selection criteria, such as sample size, the orders of the generated processes, or the maximum considered orders. Moreover, when analyzing the results, domain experts are interested in the average output of the selection criterion, in whether a selection criterion tends to overor underfit the order, and in the distribution of false positives.  Overview of our visual analytics framework. Using the visual interface, the user provides (1) settings for the synthetic process generator as well as (2) order selection criteria to be evaluated. <ref type="formula">3</ref>Realizations of the processes are generated and used to test the given selection criteria. The visual interface receives live feedback from the evaluation and constantly updates the visualization. Based on this responsive visual feedback, experts can quickly perform fine-tuning of selection criteria or alter generator settings.</p><p>In this paper we introduce a visual analytics framework that-in combination with a novel synthetic AR process generator-allows comprehensive interactive evaluation and development of order selection criteria. Since this is a new form of comprehensive evaluation in AR theory, collaboration with domain experts was of particularly importance for the development of both the workflow, as well as a suitable user interface. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> gives an overview of the resulting visual analytics framework. The user provides settings for the synthetic AR process generator (e.g. order, sample size), <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> (1). These settings are then forwarded to an evaluation thread that is constantly running in the background generating vast numbers of synthetic AR processes based on these specifications. A scripting interface enables users to add desired order selection criteria to the evaluation, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. These criteria are then tested in the evaluation thread and immediate feedback is given to the user about their average performance, i.e. how often the criterion selected the correct order. Specialized interactive visualizations guide users to quickly gauge the reliability of each criterion, to identify overand underfitting selection bias, and to determine the amount of false positives, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1 (3)</ref>.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives a motivation and overview of the problem domain. Section 3 discusses related work. Section 4 explains our approach to create synthetic AR processes. Section 5 describes our interactive user interface and details our visual analytics approach. Section 6 demonstrates the performance of our framework and evaluates our approach using two scientific examples, as well as an application example. Section 7 concludes this paper and outlines future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">MOTIVATION</head><p>Let AR(p) denote an autoregressive process (autoregressive model) of order p ∈ N, defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">X t + a 1 X t−1 + ••• + a p X t−p = ε t , t ∈ Z (1)</formula><p>where a 1 ,..., a p ∈ R are the parameters and ε t are normal independent and identically distributed random variables with zero mean and σ 2 variance (white noise). Fitting such an AR model to time series data consists of two steps: Selecting the order of the model and determining the corresponding parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. All orders-up to a user-defined maximum-are considered and the parameters for each order are estimated using established parameter estimation methods. For each set of parameters, the residual variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> is calculated and used as a fitness measure. As the fitness naturally increases with the number of parameters, many order selection criteria have been proposed to balance model error against model size to prevent over-or underfitting the data. As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>, the order for which a selection criterion returns the minimum value is considered to be the best fit.</p><p>Two different cases can be distinguished in AR model order selection: The first is the infinite sample or asymptotic case. Asymptotic criteria are mathematically derived and select the correct AR process-or the best approximation if no such process exists-with probability approaching 1 for a sufficiently large sample size. Finite sample criteria, on the other hand, are heuristic selection criteria, based on the fact that infinitely large sample sizes are not encountered in practice.</p><p>The parameters of an AR process are commonly estimated using either the Yule-Walker <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, Burg <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, or the Least-Squares <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> methods. These parameter estimation methods are well-researched and perform well in most scenarios. Even if the given time series data does not have an underlying AR process, the Yule-Walker and Least-Squares estimates behave in a good-natured manner and lead to well interpretable results <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. It should be noted that the Least-Squares method does not guarantee the estimated model to be stable <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and is therefore less frequently used than the other two methods.</p><p>In the asymptotic sample case, the choice of parameter estimator does not influence the performance of the applied order selection criterion. However, it is well known that this is not true for the finite sample case <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>-a fact that is often neglected when evaluating selection criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. In fact, many studies on the performance of order selection criteria only consider a single parameter estimation method, a narrow set of possible orders, and fewer than ten AR processes with arbitrarily pre-defined parameters. In particular, the influences of parameter estimation methods, process order, and process root distribution have received little attention.</p><p>Therefore, a customizable evaluation framework is needed, in order to allow users to compare selection criteria based on their individual requirements, e.g. sample size, parameter estimation method, maximum order etc. Such tests have to be performed on a representative set of AR processes, thus also requiring a synthetic process generator. Visual analytics can be used to provide an intuitive and interactive graphical user interface that not only allows the above mentioned customization options, but also presents responsive evaluation feedback. As new order selection criteria are still being developed, the framework further needs to be extensible by providing an interface for adding new selection criteria.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RELATED WORK</head><p>Compared to other visual analytics approaches in the field of time series analysis, we do not directly analyze <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, predict <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>, or explore <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref> individual time series data sets. Instead, we present a tool to evaluate and develop the kind of automatic order selection criteria which are used in such tools as the ARMASA Toolbox created by Broersen <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, or the TiMoVA prototype created by Bögl et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</p><p>There have been many simulation studies evaluating the performance of order selection criteria. Some concentrate on the be-haviour of order selection criteria regarding a great number of realizations from individual autoregressive processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>. However, as Broersen <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> pointed out: Such studies might lead to dubious conclusions, as they compare criteria known to be sensitive to overfit, with criteria known to be sensitive to underfit. The obtained results thus heavily depend on whether the considered processes are more prone to underfit or to overfit. Therefore, a more general evaluation approach is required that samples from a representative set of AR processes to avoid such a fitting bias. While there have been Monte Carlo simulation studies that evaluate the behavior of selection criteria for a large set of different AR processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>, these studies sample only from a limited subset of possible AR processes. As will be discussed in Section 4, our proposed framework features a more general synthetic generator that additionally allows user-defined statistical distributions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">AUTOREGRESSIVE PROCESS GENERATION</head><p>Synthetic data generation algorithms enable users to create artificial data sets with desired characteristics. Generating time series data from an autoregressive process is simple. However, representatively sampling synthetic stationary autoregressive processes themselves is significantly more difficult.</p><p>Stationarity is a crucial property of time series models. Meaning that an occurring shock has a diminishing effect over time and will finally disappear. Formally, an AR(p) process, Equation <ref type="formula">1</ref>, is stationary, iff the corresponding p-th order linear homogeneous difference</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">equation X t + a 1 X t−1 + ••• + a p X t−p = 0</formula><p>is stable <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. This difference equation is stable, iff the roots (zeros)</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">r 1 , r 2 ,..., r p of the corresponding characteristic polynomial χ(λ ) = λ p + p ∑ ν=1 a ν λ p−ν</formula><p>are inside the unit circle <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. In literature, stationarity of autoregressive processes is commonly assumed and we will do the same throughout this paper, unless noted otherwise.</p><p>In particular, domain experts are interested in being able to customize the distribution of roots, since the behaviour of AR processes is known to be influenced by the position of its roots in the unit circle.</p><p>When creating AR processes, the most common approach in literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref> is to directly sample the parameters uniformly in such a way that the sufficient condition for stationarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">p ∑ ν=1 |a ν | &lt; 1.</formula><p>is fulfilled. However, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> (a), this method is not comprehensive as it only samples from a limited subset of possible stationary AR models.</p><p>Another prominent approach is the Beadle and Djurić algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. It exploits the Levinson-Durbin recursion to guarantee that the generated AR process is stationary, and that the parameters are uniformly distributed in the parameter space, however not in the root space, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4 (b)</ref>. While the distribution of the generated processes can-in theory-be customized, the authors remark that altering the distribution is a non-trivial task.</p><p>We therefore developed a more intuitive approach that allows greater control over the distribution of generated processes, inspired by the direct-root method <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> from the field of control and system theory. Rather than generating parameters for an AR process, we directly generate p complex roots r 1 , r 2 ,..., r p inside the unit circle, and then derive the corresponding parameters, in order to obtain the stationary AR(p) process. These parameters a ν are given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">a ν = (−1) p−ν σ p−ν (r 1 , r 2 ,..., r p ),</formula><p>where σ is the elementary symmetric function <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>Since we directly generate our roots, we can use either a uniform distribution, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4 (c)</ref>, or any arbitrary statistical distribution.</p><p>Based on this method, we developed an intuitive widget that allows users to directly modify the root distribution. We will discuss this widget in detail in Section 5. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">EVALUATING ORDER SELECTION CRITERIA</head><p>Our framework is designed around the synthetic autoregressive process generator outlined in Section 4. While the user enters and investigates order selection criteria, an evaluation thread is constantly running in the background. This thread repeatedly generates synthetic AR processes, then samples time series data from these processes, and finally attempts to fit processes to that data using the user-defined order selection criteria. Since the ground truth processes are known, the framework can assess the accuracy of these fittings, and provide insight into the average performance of each order selection criterion, e.g. how often the criterion selected the correct order, and whether a criterion tends to under-or overfit the order. In our implementation, hundreds of AR process can be tested each second. Results are accumulated, averaged and presented to the user instantly. Whenever the user changes a setting of the AR generator, the previously accumulated results are automatically reset. New results usually stabilize within less than one or two seconds of such a reset, thus providing responsive feedback. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> provides an overview of our user interface, which is divided into four areas. The Settings bar on the left houses the variables for the synthetic process generator, a general Evaluation area at the top provides comparison views of all active order selection criteria, another more Specialized Evaluation area, holds information about the individual performance of a user-picked selection criterion, and the Order Selection Criterion area at the bottom of the interface allows managing and editing selection criteria.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Graphic User Interface</head><p>Overall, the interface is designed to be clean and simple to use. We favored visualizations commonly found in domain literature, such as line graphs and bar graphs, as those were most familiar to domain experts. There was an early discussion what parallel views were required for the evaluation. In particular regarding the simultaneous comparison of generator settings. Our domain experts favored fewer highly interactive views that highlight comparisons of different selection criteria for a single generator setting. This was motivated by the fact that usually a fixed scenario (generator setting) is assumed and order selection criteria are evaluated against or fine-tuned for that specific setting. In the case that a user wants to compare two generator settings simultaneously these settings can be saved and loaded into a second instance of our application.</p><p>(1) Root Distribution Controls The most prominent widget in our Settings bar is the Root Distribution Controller which controls our synthetic process generator, see Section 4. At the center of the widget, a scatter plot constantly updates to show the generated complex roots in the unit circle, giving an impression of the root distribution. As certain properties (e.g. degree of stability) of an AR process mainly depend Four buttons allow users to choose from different distributions: uniform, Gaussian, inverted Gaussian, and reflected Gaussian. An additional slider below the widget allows setting a percentage of sampled real roots that shall be enforced by the synthetic process generator. As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>, these options enable users to model a variety of root distributions. (2) Additional Settings In addition to manipulating the root distribution, our framework offers further settings to customize the evaluation.</p><p>As the behavior of order selection criteria varies for different maximum orders <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, our framework allows users to change that number. For example, order selection criteria prone to overfit are more likely to select the highest possible order. Such criteria will therefore yield higher success rates for that order-along with an increased number of false positives. Changing the maximum number of observed ordersalong with our framework's responsive visual feedback-allows experts to quickly discern a truly higher success rate from the results of overfitting.</p><p>Another important variable is the sample size, i.e. the number of steps in the generated time series data. As discussed in Section 2, most of the established order selection criteria are mathematically derived for asymptotic sample sizes, while more recent heuristic criteria are designed for finite sample scenarios. When comparing such criteria, it is important to investigate their behavior for both small finite sample cases, as well as larger sample sizes. Our framework allows setting an arbitrary sample size.</p><p>We further implemented all three established parameter estimation methods discussed in Section 2: Burg, Least Squares, and Yule-Walker.</p><p>(3) Order Selection Criteria At the bottom of our graphical interface, order selection criteria and their corresponding graph colors are shown in a list widget. New selection criteria may be added and existing ones may be edited using a simple ECMAScript editor. Since most established order selection criteria are functions that can be represented in just a single line of code this interface proved sufficient for untrained users, and powerful for domain experts with basic programming knowledge. We discuss this interface in detail in Section 5.2. (4) Guess Accuracy The main part of our user interface consists of a set of interactive visualizations designed to aid the evaluation of selection criteria. These visualizations are animated and constantly update to show the latest results of the ongoing evaluation thread. This rapid feedback allows experts to gauge the relative quality of order selection criteria within a few seconds of starting-or altering-the evaluation.</p><p>The most intuitive evaluation view is a line graph visualization that gives a straight-forward comparison of the average success rates of each selection criterion, i.e. the percentage with which each criterion correctly identified processes of a given order. Each line represents a selection criterion. For each order, the percentage is given with which the selection criterion correctly identified processes of that order. This <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>: Example for the interactive Guess Distribution plot, showing the AIC (red), BIC (green), FAIC (blue), FBIC (purple) order selection criteria. All criteria have a low success rate for the observed (correct) order 9. Additionally, the non-finite sample criteria AIC and BIC both show significant overfit at orders 11 and 12.</p><p>makes it easy to compare the accuracy of different selection criteria against each other. (5) Guess Distribution In addition to comparing the overall success rate, our domain experts noted that it would also be interesting to investigate the distribution of false guesses for a given correct order. This could be used to determine whether a selection criterion is prone to over-or underfit. To this end, we designed an interactive line graph visualization that compares the distribution of guesses for all selection criteria. The user drags a slider to pick an order. The results are then filtered to show the percentage with which the criteria selected an order, if the correct order would have been the one picked by the user. This again shows the success rate for the chosen order, but also allows insight into the error of each criterion. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> shows an example where the order 9 is chosen. We observe that in this example the order selection criteria AIC <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> (red) and BIC <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> (green) show significant overfitting at orders 11 and 12, whereas the corresponding finite sample variants FAIC (blue) and FBIC <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> (purple) show signs of underfitting. (6) Average Guess If an order selection criterion is highlighted by the user, additional views become available that allow further insight into this specific criterion. One such view is the Average Guess for a selection criterion. This deviation plot illustrates how far the average order guess differs from the correct order. (7) Output of Selection Criterion When analyzing the individual selection criteria, experts are interested in the behaviour of the values of the selection criterion and the values of the residual variance over the different orders. We use a bar graph to illustrate both the residual variance (gray), as well as the penalty for model size (in the color of the selection criterion). The minimum value for a given order is additionally highlighted. This visualization was inspired by the traditional textbook illustration similar to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref> shows examples where the minimum order does not correspond to the observed (correct) order, with (a) demonstrating an example of underfit, while (b) shows a case of overfit. (8) Selection Error The selection error serves as a guide for the Output of a Selection Criterion. For each order, the order for which the selection criterion returns the minimum value is plotted in the deviation graph. This guides users towards the interesting views in the previous visualization, i.e. those orders for which the selected minimum differs from the correct optimum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Scripting Interface</head><p>Our framework provides a simple scripting interface that allows adding and editing new order selection criteria using ECMAScript. In addition to the most common mathematical functions, our implementation provides a few important variables: The current order p, the maximum order P, the sample size N, the finite sample variance coefficient v, and the residual variance r. In our implementation, we decided to use Broersen's calculation of the residual variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, as it is equivalent to the more common calculation, but proved to be more numerically stable. As a convenience for users our framework already supplies the AIC, BIC, HQC <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and several finite sample selection criteria. In addition to these straight-forward selection criteria, the powerful scripting interface further allows domain experts with basic programming knowledge to implement arbitrarily complex order selection criteria using conditionals, loops, and custom methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">RESULTS</head><p>We investigate the applicability and usefulness of our proposed framework for different use cases. We begin our evaluation with a look at the performance of our implementation. Next, we show how our framework can be used to conduct more general evaluations of order selection criteria than existing simulation studies. We then take a look at a real world scenario, in which autoregressive processes are used for anomaly detection in nuclear reactor analysis. Finally, we use our findings to develop a new specialized order selection criterion for near-unit root distributions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Performance</head><p>We tested our framework on an Intel Core i7-4820K CPU @ 3.70GHz. This platform supports generating and evaluating autoregressive processes in real time, <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>. We measure our performance in trials, where each trial consists of the generation and evaluation of one autoregressive process for each order up to the maximum order. For example, in a trial of maximum order 20, 20 synthetic autoregressive processes of order 1 to 20 are generated. For each of these 20 processes, 20 sets of possible parameters are estimated and the best order <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>: Average running times for one trial with a given maximum order and a sample size of 100 and the AIC for order selection. Each plot uses a different parameter estimation method. From left to right: Yule-Walker, Burg, and Least Squares. The timings of each individual step-i.e. process generation (orange), parameter estimation (green), and order selection (blue)-are additionally highlighted. We observe that the less frequently used Least Squares estimation method performs approximately ten times slower than the other two methods.</p><p>is selected using an order selection criterion. Generating and evaluating such a trial of order 20-the most common maximum order encountered in literature-takes less than 5 milliseconds using the Burg or Yule-Walker parameter estimation methods. Even at order 50 our implementation is still interactive at 20 trials per second.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Use Case: Finite Sample Case</head><p>There have been simulation studies evaluating order selection criteria for the finite sample case. However, these studies have so far only been conducted for individual orders, e.g. orders 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, 4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and 5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Furthermore, these studies have all used the limited sufficient condition sampling, see Section 4. In the following use case, we demonstrate how our framework can be used to conduct a more general evaluation, using arbitrary orders and a more representative set of AR processes. We compare asymptotic order selection criteria with their finite sample variants for different root distributions for multiple orders. The most commonly used asymptotic criterion AIC is compared with the finite sample AICc <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, Broersen's AIC variant called FAIC <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and the AICF <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> provides a step-by-step overview of our experiment, with the root distribution of each step on the left and a line graph comparing the resulting hit percentages of the order selection criteria on the right.</p><p>We begin our experiment using the Yule-Walker parameter estimator, a uniform root distribution, and a sample size of 25. We observe that in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10 (a)</ref>, the AICF and AICc perform best, while the AIC shows the lowest hit percentages. Furthermore, the accuracy of all criteria significantly decreases for higher orders, with a minor peak towards the highest order, which might indicate overfit.</p><p>When switching to a Gaussian root distribution-which has more roots located near the unit circle-we notice that the accuracy of all order selection criteria increases, even for higher orders, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10 (b)</ref>. However, as the lower bound of the root distribution is dragged towards the unit circle-i.e. only roots near the unit circle are considered-a sharp peak can be observed at order 1, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10 (c)</ref>.</p><p>By interactively investigating the individual Guess Distributions of the selection criteria, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11 (a)</ref>, we find that all criteria have a strong tendency to underfit, especially to select the lowest possible order 1 as a false positive. For example for order 2 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> (a) 40% of the time the selection criteria falsely select order 1 instead of order 2. Since order 1 is selected more often in general, it is also more likely to be guessed correctly, leading to the apparent peak.</p><p>Such behavior is expected by domain experts and originates from the use of the Yule-Walker parameter estimation method, which is known to yield poor estimates when the roots of the original process are located near the unit circle <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. We therefore switch to the Burg parameter estimation method-which is known to remain stable in this case-and observe that the peak disappears and that all selection criteria perform better overall, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10 (d)</ref>. The percentage of correct guessed orders up to order 4 of the AIC is for each order about 60%, whereas the AICF and AICc correctly guess around 80% of the time. Furthermore, we observe a significant improvement of the accuracy towards higher orders. Taking another look at the guess distributions shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> (b), reveals a strong tendency to overfit, i.e. create false positives at higher orders, especially at the last considered order 6. The Guess Distribution plots even show that the criteria never falsely select orders that were lower than the correct order, i.e. no underfitting occurs. It can be observed that using either method, the relative performance of selection criteria remains the same, with the AICF and AICc yielding the best results.   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref>. (a) For the Yule-Walker parameter estimation method, we observe that all criteria have a tendency to underfit, especially to pick order 1. (b) For the Burg method, this tendency disappears and the overall success rate increases. However, a tendency to overfit is apparent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Use Case: Nuclear Reactor Analysis</head><p>Autoregressive modeling is used in nuclear reactor analysis to detect anomalies in the reactor operation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Acoustic signals from the nuclear reactor are measured during normal operation and the autoregressive process is determined. If modelled properly, the residual noise will have a white frequency spectrum for stationary signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. It is assumed, that this is no longer true if anomalies occur in the reactor operation, resulting in a large residual variance. However, if the process order is chosen too large (overfitting) the residual variance might raise for not-anomaly data resulting in a false alarm. Whereas if underfitting occurs, one or more significant parameters have been excluded from the process and an anomaly might not be detected.</p><p>The 1994 IAEA Benchmark test on leak detection from acoustic signals in a steam generator of a liquid metal fast breeder reactor included both measurements during normal reactor operations and during anomalies. The test data were synthesised of background noise measured with four acoustic detectors. Hoogenboom and Schoonewelle <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> proposed to use the AIC with the Burg parameter estimation method and a sample size of 2048 to determine the best model order. The authors dismissed the Yule-Walker parameter method as not suitable for this case, as it returned non-interpretable results. De Hoon et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> showed that the roots of the processes during normal operation were all located close to the boundary of the unit circle. As observed in Section 6.2, this is a possible explanation for the bad results obtained using the Yule-Walker method.</p><p>Knowing that all roots are located near the unit circle, we can use our framework to analyze whether the AIC is the best order selection criterion for detecting anomalies in this use-case. We compare the AIC with the other two most common order selection criteria BICs and HQC. As the exact root distribution is not known, but only the information that the roots are close to the boundary of the unit circle, we consider a wider range of possible distributions. We begin with a Gaussian distribution and use our Root Distribution Controls, in order to drag the lower boundary closer to the edge of the unit circle. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref>, this leads to an improvement of the guess accuracy of the BIC and HQC for higher orders. However, both criteria are around 20% more accurate than the AIC. We observe that the AIC accuracy suddenly peaks at order 20 for root distributions closer to the unit circle, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12(b)</ref> and (c). This is consistent with the observation made in Section 6.2, regarding overfitting of the AIC. This can further be observed in the Selection Error view, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 13</ref>.</p><p>Overall, we can conclude that the BIC and HQC both perform significantly better than the AIC for the conditions of the benchmark.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Use Case: Fine Tuning</head><p>In the following, we demonstrate the development of a new order selection criterion for a special case, using our framework. In Section 6.3 we observed, that the performance of the BIC and HQC using the Burg estimator improved drastically for roots near the unit circle, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12</ref>. Looking back at the finite sample case, we are now interested in the behavior of the BIC and HQC for small sample sizes. In particular, we want to develop a new finite sample order selection criterion for near-unit root distributions.</p><p>The HQC even outperforms the AICF, which had scored best in our evaluation in Section 6.2. The BIC shows comparable results to the AICF. When further investigating the HQC and BIC, we observe that for order 1 the HQC shows little error, as opposed to the BIC, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 14</ref> As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 15</ref> this new selection criterion (orange) outperforms all other criteria in the finite sample case for this scenario, as it shows the highest accuracy, i.e. the highest percentage of correctly selected order. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12</ref>: Evaluation of order selection criteria for detecting anomalies in reactor operations using the properties of the 1994 IAEA benchmark. Each row shows the success rates for the AIC (red), BIC (green), and HQC (blue) and the corresponding root distribution: (a) Gaussian distribution, (b) Gaussian with lower bound, (c) near-unit distribution. We observe that the relative accuracy of the selection criteria remains the same for all root distributions near the unit circle. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 13</ref>: Selection offset of the AIC for the nuclear reactor example.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In this paper we have presented a novel visual analytics framework to aid domain experts in the evaluation of existing, and in the creation of new order selection criteria for autoregressive processes. Our synthetic process generator samples a representative set of autoregressive processes with user-defined statistical distributions. Due to a specifically developed evaluation thread, immediate feedback can be given to the user, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation in real-time.</p><p>In cooperation with domain experts, specialized interactive visualizations have been developed to guide the user to quickly gauge the reliability of each criterion, to identify over-and underfitting selection bias, and to determine the amount of false positives. We demonstrated that our framework is able to support the analysis and comparison of different order selection criteria, using both two general examples as well as a real-world use case based on nuclear reactor analysis.</p><p>As future work, we intend to perform a comparative study of the effectiveness of existing order selection criteria, to investigate how root distributions can be automatically obtained from time series data, and to adapt our framework from autoregressive processes to the closely related ARMA time series model.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>VisualFig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Analytics for Development and Evaluation of Order Selection Criteria for Autoregressive Processes Thomas Löwe Student Member, IEEE, Emmy-Charlotte Förster Student Member, IEEE, Georgia Albuquerque, Jens-Peter Kreiss, and Marcus Magnor Senior Member, IEEE Our proposed framework helps domain experts evaluate and develop order selection criteria for autoregressive processes.</figDesc></figure>
