<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Architectural lighting design has a strong impact on the atmosphere and aesthetics of buildings and open spaces. The illumination also affects how working environments foster productivity and creativity. However, finding an acceptable trade-off between often contradictory customer requests regarding the quality and price of a lighting setup while conforming to industry standards is a challenging task. Physically accurate lighting simulations have long been used to support lighting designers in planning and communicating potential solutions to customers. Given a 3D geometric model of the scene as well as the position, type, and additional properties of the involved luminaries, the simulation computes the illuminance for each part of the scene.</p><p>Commercial software for lighting design <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> typically takes up to several hours to compute the result of a single setup, and focuses on inspecting a single solution rather than comparing many solutions. As a consequence, the workflow in lighting design has traditionally been restricted to computing a small number of alternative setups in a trial-and-error fashion. As an additional challenge, separate tools have been required for analyzing aesthetic and financial aspects of a given lighting design <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Therefore, it has been highly dependent on the experience of the lighting designer, how fast a convincing solution could be found.</p><p>Recent advances in lighting simulation reduced the effort for computing a physically accurate illumination to a few seconds <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Technologically, this enables significant improvements in the workflow of lighting designers. First, it is now possible to examine the design space much more systematically and comprehensively by computing hundreds of potential solutions as a starting point of the design process. Second, lighting designers may now define and compute additional setups on-the-fly, e.g., during a workshop with a customer.</p><p>However, existing software tools in lighting design do not support these new possibilities well. For this reason, we conducted a design study in collaboration with lighting design experts. The result is Lite-Vis, a system for the efficient decision support in lighting design. In contrast to existing tools, a focus of LiteVis is on a comprehensive comparison of multiple solutions. LiteVis tightly integrates global illumination-based lighting simulation, a spatial representation of the 3D scene, and non-spatial visualizations of setup parameters and result indicators. Specifically, LiteVis relies on hierarchically structured measurement surfaces in the 3D scene for defining quantitative quality indicators. Weighting these spatial indicators along with non-spatial indicators, such as monetary costs, supports a holistic view of all relevant decision factors while making the decision maker's preference explicit and reproducible.</p><p>The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:</p><p>• A design study of decision making in lighting design resulting in the system LiteVis. • A problem characterization of the application domain of lighting design, including an abstraction that relates the application problem to other areas of simulation-based decision making. • A novel visualization for ranking multiple decision options based on weighting hierarchically structured objectives. • A report on feedback from domain experts and a reflection on the design process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK 2.1 Lighting Design</head><p>In the scientific community, several approaches to semi-automatic or user-guided, interactive lighting design have been proposed, e.g., sketch-based methods, where the user "paints" the scene parts to be lit <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, as well as procedural methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Additionally, the direct specification of lighting-induced features like shadows or highlights <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> have been suggested to trigger the generation of an ideal lighting solution. While all these approaches tackle the problem in plausible ways, they have not found their way into today's industry standard lighting design tools. Potential reasons are that some constraints are hard to express mathematically (e.g., regarding aesthetics), or the wish for artistic freedom. Glaser et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> have approached the lighting design problem by developing various 2D visualization prototypes, inspiring our work in terms of analytical aspects, but without linking spatial 3D and non-spatial 2D views in a common tool. Commercial lighting design applications, on the other hand, leave the task of placing and adjusting the light sources in a scene to the skills of a lighting designer. Tools like Relux <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, Dialux <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, Agi32 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> or others rely on Radiosity and/or Raytracing-based simulation kernels. They visualize the simulated results on measurement areas placed in the 3D scene using false color visualizations. None of them supports the user in the comparison of different solutions. Separate tools, such as ecoCALC <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, tackle related problem domains like financial aspects. Even though their respective outputs are needed to form an overall decision, the tools used in the workflow of finding an ideal solution are oftentimes isolated from each other, which makes a holistic exploration of the problem space cumbersome.</p><p>We base our approach on a lighting modeling system that relies on a simulation kernel recently proposed by Luksch et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. It provides a faster lighting simulation as compared to Radiosity-based approaches and thereby enables faster scene parametrization and evaluation cycles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Visual Parameter Exploration</head><p>The field of visual parameter space exploration has shown significant progress in the last years. Beham et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> developed a composite visualization that combines the abstract parameter space of geometry generators with the output space of the resulting shapes. Illustrative parallel coordinates allows the user to study the sensitivity of parameters in a global-to-local drill down fashion. In LiteVis, we also connect the input space with the output. However, in our case, input as well as output have both spatial and non-spatial properties. Coffey et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> propose a tool for simulation-based design that provides integration of forward design (input manipulation) and inverse design. Inverse design lets the user query a database of pre-computed samples by specifying the desired simulation output/result directly in the 3D scene. This specification of goals in the 3D scene shares the same principle as the specification of spatial objectives in LiteVis (see Sec. 4.2). Bruckner and Möller <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> propose a tool for the exploration of clustered time series data of physical fluid simulations for visual effects design. Since their approach is result driven, the input is not of interest to the user. In contrast to the solution by Bruckner and Möller, we do not have to deal with dynamic scenes but our scenario demands an inputas well as output-driven approach. While the input is not abstract, it is restricted according to constraints of the use case scenario.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Multi-Objective Decision Making</head><p>In lighting design, multiple objectives must be optimized simultaneously. This is a common issue in many application domains. For this reason, multi-objective optimization (MOO) has long been an active field of research (see, e.g., Köksalan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> for a survey). As a single best solution does not exist for MOO-problems, one approach is to offer the decision maker multiple solutions that have been (semi-)automatically generated. Miettinen and Mäkelä, for instance, introduced an interactive method called NIMBUS <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, that asks the user to repeatedly examine the values of objective functions calculated for a current solution.</p><p>There are several approaches for visualizing the set of multiobjective optimal solutions, which is known as the Pareto Frontier. Korhonen and Wallenius <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> stress that visualizing the Pareto Frontier for more than three objectives is difficult. The authors classify several visualization techniques for multi-criterion decision making based on the cardinality of the result set. Lotov et al. employ scatter-plot matrices to show bi-objective slices of the Pareto Frontier <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. In order to support decision making, Andrienko and Andrienko <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> propose several extensions to parallel coordinates, the prevalent technique for visualizing Pareto Frontiers <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. More recently, Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> employ self-organizing maps for projecting all Pareto-optimal solutions to a 2D radial visualization. However, most of these approaches do not scale to a very high number of objectives, e.g., up to hundreds in lighting design if spatial aspects are taken into account (see Sec. 3.1). Moreover, inspecting the entire set of Pareto-optimal solutions can still be inefficient.</p><p>A common approach is thus to weight the objectives in order to attain a score, which can then be used for ranking possible solutions for decision making. LineUp <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> is an interactive approach for weighting multiple objectives and visualizing the resulting ranking. While LineUp inspired our approach for decision support in the context of lighting design (Sec. 4.2), it does not scale to a very large number of objectives and does not take the semantics of these options into account, e.g., the underlying parametrization. As an additional problem for most approaches in lighting design, each solution refers to the illumination of an entire scene and has thus complex characteristics, such as aesthetics, which are hard to quantify.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">LIGHTING DESIGN BACKGROUND</head><p>This section provides a brief introduction to the field of lighting design as far as necessary for understanding the design decisions of LiteVis. This information is based on experiences gained from a tight collaboration with experts in lighting design for nearly five years. After describing the data and the tasks, we motivate the key design goals of LiteVis. In a problem abstraction, we put the domain specific challenges into a broader context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">The Data: Simulation in Lighting Design</head><p>Modern lighting design is based on lighting simulations which compute an output illumination for a particular scene and luminary setup. As for many simulation types, the input of a lighting simulation can be classified as control parameters, environmental parameters, and model parameters. We refer to a particular assignment of values to all parameters that are necessary for starting a simulation as parametrization. We refer to simulated parametrizations as solutions or simulation runs.</p><p>The control parameters in lighting design, are luminaries and their placement and orientation in the scene. They are applied by designers to achieve certain goals regarding the appearance and budgetary constraints of a solution. Luminaries are placed using controls similar to those in geometric modeling tools. Each luminary has several parameters. The most important ones in the context of this paper are:</p><p>• Type: Type corresponds to a particular product of a manufacturer which is typically classified by the application as, e.g., floor lamps, ceiling lamps, wall mounted lamps. • Wattage: This parameter describes the illumination power and energy consumption of a luminary. • Dim profile: A luminary can be dimmed, resulting in lower power consumption and increased longevity, but also lower performance. Environmental parameters describe aspects of the simulation which are not directly controlled by the user or vary over time:</p><p>• Scene: Contains the 3D geometry of the scene such as desks, windows, walls, etc. Geometry can absorb and reflect light based on material properties, and also act as an occluder. • Environmental conditions: Such conditions determine external influences, like sunshine that illuminates a scene based on the time of day/year and the weather condition. These factors can optionally be included in the simulation. Model parameters are the implicit parameters of the lighting simulation algorithm responsible for transforming the simulation input into the simulation output. Model parameters typically define a trade-off between accuracy and speed. An example is the number of times the light bounces in the calculation of the indirect illumination. These parameters are not of direct concern to the lighting designer and therefore play a minor role in scope of this paper.</p><p>The output of the lighting simulation comprises an illuminance value (measured in lux) for each texel in the scene. Using this direct output for 3D rendering of the scene is suitable for a qualitative inspection of the results. However, for most tasks, the direct simulation output is too detailed. The standard approach in lighting design for condensing the data and assessing the compliance to industry standards is based on pre-defined measurement surfaces on top of the geometry. Each measurement surface corresponds to a semantically meaningful part of the scene such as a particular desk, a certain part of the wall, a door, etc. A scene typically comprises multiple types of surfaces which are structured hierarchically. For example, a top-down classification of a particular measurement surface could be "officeworking area -all desks -desk 3".</p><p>Measurement surfaces aggregate the illuminance of their geometry to define quantitative local indicators. The most important local indicators in lighting design are the minimal, maximal, and the average illumination, and uniformity. Uniformity is defined as the relation of the minimal illumination to the average illumination and describes the evenness of the distribution of illuminance values on a surface.</p><p>It is common to define target values for these local indicators per measurement surface and to assess the suitability of a solution in terms of the difference to the respective target values. Different classes of measurement surfaces are subject to varying degrees of constraints regarding the illumination quality, which is reflected in different target values (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>). In addition to a customer-driven specification of target values, several classes of measurement areas such as desks must also meet industry norms and standards <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>This description of lighting simulations in the context of lighting design is general and applies to commercial systems as well as to the simulation underlying LiteVis <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. In all cases, the simulation by various software tools involves global illumination techniques. In commercial systems, the effort for computing the illumination of a single parametrization takes up to several hours, depending on the complexity of the scene and the configuration of the luminaries. Using the GPU and clustering virtual point lights into a set of virtual polygon lights, the simulation underlying LiteVis, however, reduces the effort  <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. Conceptional sketch made by a lighting design expert, defining the location of the measurement surfaces and their target values in the office scene according to industry standards <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>for obtaining comparable results to a few seconds. We refer to Luksch et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> for additional technical details of the lighting simulation.</p><p>Besides the simulation output and the indicators derived from this output, global indicators regarding budgetary values of the scene parametrization are crucial for the final decision. Specifically, each type of luminary has an investment cost as well as a run-time cost in terms of energy consumption.</p><p>Summarizing, the key entities of LiteVis are the simulated parametrizations. Regarding the data model, each parametrization comprises a multivariate part and a geometric part. The multivariate part includes (1) the parameters per luminary such as wattage, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> environmental variables like the simulated time of day, (3) the local indicators per measurement surface and their deviation from the target values, and (4) the global indicators regarding monetary cost. The geometric part describes the spatial extent of the illumination in terms of an illuminance value per texel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Task Analysis</head><p>Our collaboration with experts in lighting design enabled us to identify the following recurring tasks <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3</ref>). The subsequent list of tasks is based on insights gained from semi-structured interviews and contextual inquiries <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>• T0 -Scene setup: After the scene is modeled by a 3D artist, measurement surfaces are defined on top of the geometry, e.g., for desks and walls. The designer defines target values and constraints for local indicators, such as uniformity per measurement surface, in accordance with customer requirements and industry norms. • T1 -Scene parametrization: The lighting designer defines one or more parametrizations for a subsequent simulation. This particularly includes the placement and parametrization of a specific set of luminaries in the scene according to customer requirements, budget constraints, industry standards, and the designer's experience in order to achieve specific aesthetic effects. The designer may also specify certain environmental conditions, such as the position of the sun. The initial definition of parametrizations is mainly based on the experience and skill of the designer while later iterations are based on insights from previous solutions. In all cases, the generation of parametrizations may be partly automated based on parameter variations, e.g., for varying values of luminary wattage. • T2 -Assessment of single solutions: Once a simulation has been completed, its qualitative and quantitative output is typically evaluated individually in order to quickly reject inappropriate solutions. The qualitative evaluation assesses the aesthetic appearance of the illuminated scene in false color renderings, e.g., regarding the strength of shadow gradients. The quantitative evaluation is based on the indicators of measurement surfaces and, for example, rejects solutions that violate industry norms. • T3 -Comparison of multiple solutions: Multiple candidate solutions are compared in detail in order to understand in which regard one is superior. One goal is to further reduce the set of possible candidates by excluding those which are not superior to others according to the involved criteria. Another goal is to  <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. The five steps of the lighting designer's workflow. After initialization of the scene (T0), the lighting designer works in an iterative fashion (T1-T3) until he or she finds a satisfactory solution (T4).</p><p>identify key trade-offs, e.g., between a certain aesthetic aspect and monetary cost. Traditionally, this task is performed using side-by-side comparisons of false color renderings and the corresponding data sheets.</p><p>• T4 -Decision: In order to arrive at a final decision, it is common to weigh the various result indicators. Qualitative aspects and a detailed comparison of the illumination of multiple solutions still play an important role at this stage. In many cases, this task is performed by the lighting designer together with the customer. The traditional strategy for decision making in lighting design is based on trial&amp;error. As computing a single solution took up to several hours, only very few alternatives were typically considered in a rather sequential manner. In some cases, an initial guess that appeared to be "good enough" was used without further comparison. In other cases, it could take up to several work-days to identify an acceptable solution, especially for less experienced designers or very complex scenes.</p><p>In LiteVis, the description of these tasks remains valid. However, the lighting simulation underlying LiteVis enables two important improvements to this workflow. First, it enables to initially specify and compute a set of numerous samples in one step within T1. For example, hundreds of variations regarding luminary placements, wattages, and environmental parameters such as external lighting conditions can be simulated automatically over night. This provides a more global understanding of the space of possible solutions at a very early stage of the design process. The understanding supports the fast identification of acceptable designs while avoiding to miss interesting solutions.</p><p>Second, the simulation is fast enough to enable the exploration of additional solutions in real-time. The improved feedback loop makes it possible to reach a decision during a single meeting with a customer. Previously, multiple consecutive meetings could have been necessary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Design Goals of LiteVis</head><p>The design goals of LiteVis are motivated by the gap between the stateof-the-art software in lighting design and the new possibilities for improving the workflow as enabled by the fast simulation.</p><p>• G1 -Holistic overview of all relevant aspects: Currently, separate tools are necessary for a qualitative inspection of the simulated illumination, a quantitative analysis of result indicators, and an examination of budgetary constraints. This separation makes comparing multiple solutions cumbersome. A goal of LiteVis is thus to provide a convenient and integrated access to the simulated illumination, the local surface indicators, budgetary values, and the parameter values of a specific solution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• G2 -Integration of scene parametrization and evaluation:</head><p>The lighting simulation (T0, T1) and the evaluation of the solution (T2, T3, T4) are currently isolated from each other since they are performed with separate tools. This lack of integration impedes an efficient feedback loop between scene parametrization and evaluation. A goal of LiteVis is consequently to allow the user to trigger new simulation runs easily based on inspecting prior results, and to display new results immediately when they become available.</p><p>• G3 -Effective comparison of multiple solutions: The comparison of solutions is essential for defining additional iterations and reaching a final decision. However, current simulation tools in lighting design do not offer the designer appropriate means to understand, compare, and make decisions based on alternatives. The status quo for comparing multiple solutions is to assess the corresponding data sheets side-by-side, which is ineffective for decision making. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Problem Abstraction</head><p>For problem abstraction, the domain of simulation-based lighting design can be characterized in terms of the conceptual framework for visual parameter space analysis by Sedlmair et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. The lighting simulation is a deterministic computational input-output model. It enables an integrated sampling of control parameters, environmental parameters, and model parameters as input (see Sec. 3.1) to generate the illumination per texel as direct output. In relation to the results of computational models in other application contexts, the direct simulation output can be considered a complex object. Apart from a qualitative assessment, this complex object requires a derivation step for subsequent decision making. In our context, the derivation is an aggregation of local indicators based on measurement surfaces. The navigation strategy has traditionally been informed trial and error whereas LiteVis supports a shift towards global-to-local. While a sensitivity analysis can be interesting to lighting designers, the primary task is the optimization of multiple competing objectives corresponding to the indicators for illumination quality and monetary cost. Due to the hierarchical structure of the measurement surfaces, the corresponding objectives can also be considered hierarchical, which has motivated key design decisions of LiteVis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DESIGN STUDY OF LITEVIS 4.1 System Overview</head><p>The design of LiteVis comprises two tightly integrated parts, i.e., the spatial Simulation View, and the non-spatial Analysis Views.</p><p>The Simulation View <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1, left)</ref> provides a spatial display of the scene. While the 3D geometry of the scene is modeled externally in a 3D modeling tool, the Simulation View supports an interactive definition of measurement surfaces for scene setup (T0). It also supports the parametrization of new simulation runs (T1). To accomplish this, the user can create luminaries and interactively place their 3D representations in the scene via dragging. The user can inspect and modify luminary parameters, such as the value for wattage. Optionally, the user can specify a value range to define and simulate multiple parametrizations.</p><p>After computing simulation results, the Simulation View supports a qualitative assessment of the direct output of a single simulation run (T2) as well as a comparison of multiple runs (T3, see Sec. 4.3 and Sec. 4.4). As an alternative to rendering the illumination in a realistic way, a false color mode conveys the negative or positive distances to target values ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1)</ref>. While the comparison of parametrizations in the Simulation View is novel in the lighting designer's workflow, the scene parametrization and false color rendering represent familiar aspects of their routine.</p><p>The Analysis Views <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1, right)</ref> support the comparison and selection of simulated solutions in terms of local and global result indicators, and the underlying input parameters. Most importantly, the Simulation Ranking View enables a direct comparison of multiple solutions regarding their overall superiority as defined by a weighting of local and global indicators (Sec. 4.2). Additionally, various well-known multivariate visualizations such as parallel coordinates, bar charts, and spreadsheets may optionally be used to inspect, e.g., parameter values of the solutions. All analysis views support the selection of simulated solutions via brushing and are linked to highlight selections synchronously.</p><p>Integration of the Simulation View and the Analysis Views is implemented as follows: First, selecting one or more simulated solutions in the Analysis Views loads the corresponding parametrizations and illuminations into the Simulation View for a detailed inspection and spatial comparison. Additionally, the user may specify and simulate a new variation of the loaded parametrization by modifying parameter values. Second, selecting a representation of a measurement surface in either view, highlights this surface in both spatial and non-spatial domains. Third, creating and simulating a new parametrization in the Simulation View automatically extends the set of solutions in the Analysis Views. These types of integration enable an efficient feedback loop (G2) between scene parametrization (T1), the assessment of the result (T2), and a comparison of multiple simulation runs in a spatial and a non-spatial context (T3). The integration also helps the user in maintaining a mental connection between scene parts and their indicators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Simulation Ranking View</head><p>As contribution of this paper, we designed the Simulation Ranking View to match the requirements for efficient decision support (G4). The key idea is to rank multiple simulated solutions based on a notion of optimality that is defined as a weighted scoring of local and global indicators. The user should be able to define an emphasis on, e.g., certain parts of the scene, certain illumination indicators, such as uniformity, or on global indicators, such as investment cost. Furthermore, the user should be able to explore different preference settings by interactively changing the weights in order to see the effect on the ranking of the solutions. While fundamental aspects of the design were inspired by LineUp <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, the number and structure of involved indicators required some significant extensions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Score Computation</head><p>Before explaining the design, it is necessary to understand the computation of the scores per solution. In this context, we face three main issues: (1) The score must provide a combined assessment of global indicators, such as investment cost, as well as local indicators, such as uniformity. (2) Each local indicator (e.g., uniformity) applies to a potentially large number of measurement surfaces, where each surface may be weighted differently. (3) Per measurement surface, each local indicator may have different target values.</p><p>The overall score of a solution is defined as the weighted sum of the score per objective. Objectives can be classified as spatial and non-spatial. Non-spatial objectives refer to global indicators, e.g., the investment cost and the cost per month. For each global indicator, a scoring function maps the indicator value to a score which ranges from zero to infinity. Our current implementation simply employs linear functions with a user-defined slope that map a cost of zero to a score value of zero. Smaller score values are therefore considered better. In other words, the score value of a particular objective represents the distance of the indicator from a user-defined target value. In the case of monetary costs, this target value is zero.</p><p>We note that this definition of score values is different from the one in LineUp <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, which maps each indicator to a bounded score ranging from zero to one, with one being considered best. The main motivation for inverting the scale of the scoring function and for avoiding an upper bound is to enable expressing constraints through the scoring functions. For example, a scoring function for the indicator "investment cost" may exclude solutions where the indicator value exceeds a certain threshold by assigning very high score values to investment costs above the threshold.</p><p>Spatial objectives refer to the local indicators of measurement surfaces. Specifically, each combination of local indicator type (i.e., min, max, average, uniformity) and measurement surface defines a separate objective. For example, 18 measurement surfaces and four local indicators define a set of 72 spatial objectives. Also for spatial objectives a scoring function maps the indicator value for a particular measurement surface to the range between zero and infinity, where zero is considered best. For each spatial objective, the user may define a separate scoring function. In this case, the user can define linear as well as nonlinear scoring functions. For example, a function could assign score values of zero for a certain target range while increasing exponentially with growing distance from that target range.</p><p>Given the score values for all objectives (i.e., spatial and nonspatial), weighting enables the user to explicitly specify a personal preference. Internally, a separate weight is maintained for each objective and all weights sum up to one. However, exposing several dozens of objectives and corresponding weights to the user is neither intuitive nor effective. We thus define the per-objective weights implicitly as the product of a per-indicator weight and a per-measurement surface weight in the case of spatial objectives. For global objectives, the perobjective weight is equivalent to the per-indicator weight.</p><p>Regarding the per-indicator weights, the user may specify a weight for each indicator type. In our scenario, there are six indicator types consisting of the two global indicators and the four local indicators. For example, the user may specify a weight of 0.3 for objectives regarding uniformity. All per-indicator weights sum up to one. Regarding the per-measurement surface weights, the user may independently define a weight for each measurement surface. The weights for all surfaces also sum up to one. For example, a per-indicator weight of 0.3 for uniformity and a per-measurement surface weight of 0.1 for surface "01A" would yield a per-objective weight of 0.03 for the objective referring to maximizing the uniformity of surface "01A".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Visual Encoding and Interaction</head><p>The design of the Simulation Ranking View consists of three visual components. The Spatial Hierarchy <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 4 a)</ref> provides a hierarchically structured representation of measurement surfaces for specifying preferences in terms of per-measurement surface weights. The hierarchy is represented as an icicle plot <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> where each hierarchy level refines the degree of detail of the spatial subdivision. The root node corresponds to the entire scene and the leaf nodes represent the individual measurement surfaces. For all levels, the lengths of the nodes reflect the size of the underlying per-measurement surface weights. The user can modify these weights by dragging the boundaries between nodes on all levels. For example, reducing the size of the node "Desks" in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref> would decrease the weights for the underlying measurement surfaces 01A to 06A while increasing the weights for the surfaces of "Work Environment". Moreover, the user may specify a spatial focus by clicking on nodes at any hierarchy level. Besides highlighting the geometric representations of the corresponding measurement surfaces in the linked Simulation View, the spatial focus enables to inspect weighted scores separately for scene parts, as will be explained below.</p><p>As the second visual component, the Indicator Bar <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 4 b)</ref> displays the sizes of per-indicator weights as a stacked bar. Vertically, the bar is subdivided into two levels. The upper level shows the overall sizes of weights for spatial indicators and non-spatial indicators. Hue is used to discriminate spatial (red) and non-spatial (green) indicators. The lower level displays the proportion of the specific indicators such as uniformity, average illumination, etc. The length of a bar on the lower level thus encodes the corresponding per-indicator weight. As for the Spatial Hierarchy, the user may modify weights by dragging the boundaries between two bars on either level.</p><p>If the user has specified a spatial focus, the lengths of the red bars correspond to the subset of spatial objective weights inside the focus. In this case, the Indicator Bar displays a separate monochrome gray area representing the sum of all spatial objective weights outside the spatial focus, referred to as spatial context (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 4</ref>). The definition of weights and thus the resulting overall scores are independent from a discrimination of spatial focus and context. A visual link connects the representations of the spatial focus and context in the Spatial Hierarchy and the Indicator Bar to illustrate the relation between these two components. The design choice to include the distinction between spatial focus and context in the Indicator Bar was motivated by user feedback. They considered this visual component as a suitable legend for explaining the color-coding of the Ranked <ref type="table">Table.</ref> The Ranked Table <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 4 c)</ref> is the third visual component. It displays the individual solutions as stacked bars. The total length of each stacked bar corresponds to the overall weighted score of the respective solution. Solutions are ordered by their weighted scores. The topmost bar thus shows the best solution in the candidate list given the current weighting. The best solution is the one with the smallest weighted score. The individual bars that a stacked bar is composed of represent the weighted scores per indicator type for the particular solution. The color coding is identical as described for the Indicator Bar.</p><p>The subdivision of the stacked bars provides a visual decomposition of the overall score. For each solution, this immediately reveals the indicators contributing most to the overall score. For example, it may show that the quality of a particular solution is affected by cost-related rather than by illumination-related indicators. Analogous to the Indicator Bar, the specification of a spatial focus restricts the scores that are encoded in the lengths of the red bars to the objectives inside the focus. The weighted scores of the spatial objectives outside the focus are accumulated and appended as a gray bar. This supports the user in efficiently comparing the impact of a certain spatial region on the total scores of the solutions.</p><p>Clicking on rows in the Ranked <ref type="table">Table selects</ref> the corresponding solutions in all views of LiteVis. Linking highlights the corresponding data in other abstract views such as Parallel Coordinate Plots or a bar chart displaying the distribution of simulated parameter values (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 6 d for an example)</ref>. Selecting a solution furthermore loads the illumination and parameters for display in the spatial Simulation View. Selecting multiple solutions enables the comparison of their illumination (see Sec. 4.3 and Sec. 4.4). In the Ranked <ref type="table">Table,</ref> selected solutions are marked by a red border.</p><p>In conclusion, the Simulation Ranking View is a key element of LiteVis for achieving all four design goals. Most importantly, the ability to express preferences in terms of weights separately for measurement surfaces as well as result indicators supports an explicit and reproducible decision making process (G4). Moreover, the Ranked <ref type="table">Table enables</ref> an effective comparison of solutions regarding their weight-based desirability (G3) and enables an efficient selection of  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Measurement Surface Annotations</head><p>While the abstraction of a scene's illumination quality is necessary to enable the comparison of multiple solutions, the analysis and comparison of abstract information alone is not sufficient to form an educated opinion. For an in-depth analysis and comparison, the spatial context of local indicators is also important. The measurement surface annotations (MSA) in LiteVis form a compromise between abstraction and spatial context. The MSA enable the user to compare the distribution of illumination values on measurement surfaces from multiple simulation runs directly in the Simulation View <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 5)</ref>.</p><p>For a simulation run, this is achieved by encoding the distribution of illumination values of each surface in a binned histogram bar. For each run that is currently selected in an Analysis View, a histogram bar is created and positioned in a floating overlay that is visually linked to the corresponding surface. Rows of MSA therefore correspond to the current selection of simulated solutions. A histogram bar consists of eleven bins that are encoded with a brown/white/purple color scale. Depending on its illumination value, each texel on a surface is assigned to one of these bins. The central bin is colored white and represents the number of texels with illumination values that correspond to the respective target value of a surface. Values below/above the target are assigned to one of the brown/purple bins, depending on their distance from the target. This is the same color coding that we employ in the false color render mode (as displayed in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1)</ref>. The histogram visually encodes several indicators for each surface and each selected run. Apart from the distribution of illumination values around the target, the colors of the bins inform the user about the minimum and maximum illumination values on each surface. The uniformity of illumination is encoded in the size of the bins. An entirely white bar would be most desirable for each surface. Depending on the use case, values above the target value might also be acceptable. Values below the target are never desired.</p><p>The display of MSA is triggered as soon as more than two parametrizations are selected in an Analysis View. Mouse selection and hover states on the histogram bars are linked with the corresponding solutions in the Analysis Views. In order to avoid visual clutter, MSA are displayed only for surfaces that are part of the current spatial focus in the Spatial Hierarchy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">False Color Comparison</head><p>Even though the MSA give the user more detailed information about the spatial distribution of illumination values in a scene and allow a comparison of solutions in a spatial context, they are still abstract representations. If the local objectives of two simulation runs have the same score, they might still differ in qualitative illumination aspects. For a complete assessment of a solution, the analysis of illumination values on the actual scene geometry is therefore indispensable. For a single run, this is typically done with false color renderings that facilitate the estimation of illumination values by emphasizing the negative or positive distance to a specified target value of each point in a scene. For the comparison of multiple solutions, this had to be done in a sideby-side manner. The False Color Comparison (FCC) mode <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 6  h)</ref> gives the lighting designer the means for a detailed comparison of the illumination quality between two simulation runs directly within the simulation environment. The areas where the illumination values of each run correspond to the respective target value of a surface are rendered in a false color. Red areas indicate ideal illumination in the currently selected solution (conforming to the red selection color), while blue areas indicate ideal illumination in the currently hovered simulation run (conforming to the blue hover color). If both runs achieve ideal illumination on a texel, it is rendered in white. In compliance with the lighting designers' way of thinking, texels are considered as ideally illuminated, when they achieve at least the defined industry standard for the respective surface type. However, the acceptable range above the target value can be adjusted to adhere to special scenario requirements (e.g., when high illumination values should be avoided due to energy consumption reasons). The comparison is triggered when a single run is selected and a second run is hovered in an Analysis View or MSA.</p><p>The direct comparison that the FCC enables, has two advantages for the user. On the one side, users do not have to switch their focus between multiple views anymore when comparing two runs. On the other side, the FCC allows for more efficient feedback on newly created parametrizations by enabling an instant comparison of a new simulation run to a reference parametrization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">IMPLEMENTATION</head><p>LiteVis is built as an extension of multiple frameworks that communicate with each other via a network protocol. The Simulation View is based on an interactive global illumination lighting software that was developed with our collaborating domain experts in the scope of another project <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Its simulation kernel is based on a novel many-light simulation that allows the resulting illumination to be computed and visualized within a few seconds. This is achieved by using a GPUbased shadow mapping algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> for the visibility calculation concerning both direct and indirect light sources. The results are collected and stored adaptively in so-called light map textures that are mapped onto the scene geometry. After a scene modification, designers get immediate visual feedback, which continuously improves by converging to the physically accurate solution.</p><p>We extended the simulation with means to store, load, and export simulation data and added a web-overlay that handles rendering of and interactions with the MSA (implemented using the d3 toolkit <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>). The Analysis Views are part of a versatile visual analysis framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> in which we implemented the Simulation Ranking View. In order to enable the integration of the simulation and the analysis frameworks, both were extended with a network communication interface that manages the exchange of selection states, commands and simulation data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">USE CASE SCENARIO</head><p>In this section, we demonstrate the applicability of LiteVis based on a real-life use case scenario from our collaborating lighting designers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Scenario Description</head><p>The simulation setup consists of a 3D office scene with 18 measurement surfaces. These surfaces are arranged into three semantic groups with different target values according to industry standards <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref>:</p><p>• Task area (desks): 500 lx, 0.6 uniformity • Close surroundings (work environment): 300 lx, 0.4 uniformity • Background (walls, floor, ceiling): 100 lx, 0.1 uniformity Further, the lighting designers supplied us with a set of 107 parametrizations that refer to variations of four different lighting scenarios. A scenario is characterized by the deployed luminary types that are grouped into light groups (LGs).</p><p>LG1 is positioned over the desks.</p><p>LG2 is positioned over the hallway of the office.</p><p>• Scenario A: LG1: pendulum, LG2: downlight • Scenario B: LG1: double floor lamp, LG2: downlight • Scenario C: LG1: single floor lamp, LG2: downlight • Scenario D: built-in ceiling luminaries We demonstrate how LiteVis supports the decision making process based on a global-to-local exploration of the supplied sample data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Scenario Workflow</head><p>As starting point, the sample data base has been loaded in the Simulation Ranking View. The measurement surfaces in the Spatial Hierarchy are grouped by type and all surfaces are selected as spatial focus. Four local and two global objectives are specified <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 6 a)</ref>.</p><p>A typical first step in the workflow is the specification of permeasurement surface weights in the Spatial Hierarchy. Since the desks and work environments are of primary importance, the analyst decides to adjust the weights in the following way: Desks 60%, Work Environment 20%, Floor 10%, Walls 5%, and Ceiling 5% <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 6 b)</ref>. As a next step, the objectives for global and local indicators are adjusted in the Indicator Bar. To focus on runs with the best illumination quality regardless of budgetary constraints first, the analyst sets the weights of the non-spatial (financial) objectives to zero. Among the four local indicators of illumination quality, the analyst considers average illumination and uniformity on a surface as the most important metrics. Thus, she adjusts the weights of the four indicators as follows: Average 50%, Uniformity 30%, Maximum 15%, and Minimum 5% <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig.  6 c)</ref>. The Ranked <ref type="table">Table now</ref> shows a ranking of the simulation runs with the best illumination quality according to the specified weighting of objectives <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 6 c)</ref>. As a next question, the analyst investigates which input parameters are involved in the highest ranking simulation runs. She selects the four top-ranking simulation runs. Then she parametrizes a linked bar chart (see Sec. 4.1) for each light group to inspect the luminary types used in the top-ranking runs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 6 d)</ref>. This reveals that the LG1 luminaries are distributed across four different types, while all four runs are parametrized with the same luminary in LG2 (highlighted in red in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 6 d)</ref>.</p><p>The score in the ranking also shows that the local indicators are very distinctly distributed in each of the four simulation runs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig.  6 c)</ref>. Run R4, for instance, has the best average illumination but a high cost regarding the minimal illumination value, which the analyst finds remarkable given the small weight assigned to this objective. She therefore decides to assess the illumination quality of these four runs directly in the Simulation View. First, she investigates the distribution of illumination values for R1 using the false color render mode <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig.  6 e)</ref>. While R1 exhibits a high overall score, the rendering exposes illumination values below the target value on the desk corners.</p><p>To compare the illumination distribution to the other top-ranking runs, the analyst simultaneously selects the first four runs in the Ranked <ref type="table">Table.</ref> This triggers the display of MSA for the selected runs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 6 f)</ref>. For R1, the histogram bar in the MSA confirms that parts of the illumination are below the target value, while R2, R3 and R4 lie entirely on or above the target on the desks. In fact, their distributions are very similar. Therefore, the analyst decides to assess their quality in a spatial context as well. By selecting the histogram bars in the MSA, R2-R4 are shown individually in the Simulation View <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 6 g)</ref>. R4 exhibits the most uniform illumination on the desks. However, as the analyst knows about the customer's preference for pendulum lights in this scenario, she does not want to discard R2 and R3 yet. To gain insight about eventual trade-offs between R2 and R3, she compares them directly in the 3D scene ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 6 h)</ref>. The FCC reveals that the ideally illuminated area of R3 (blue) lies in the center between two desks, while the ideal illumination in R2 (red) is more evenly distributed across the desk surface. She therefore considers R2 as the preferred solution in terms of illumination quality.</p><p>A satisfactory parametrization has been found. Additionally, the analyst sees multiple directions for further investigations. For instance, Scenarios C and D were not present in the top four runs. She could investigate, where the runs are situated in the ranking by selecting all associated runs based on their input parametrization using linked views (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 6 d)</ref>  each scenario by filtering runs, e.g., by the type of applied luminaries. Similarly, she could eliminate R1 from the ranking by filtering all parametrizations that have a minimum illumination value on desk surfaces below the specified target value. She could also investigate how the chosen parametrizations compare against others with respect to financial goals. For this, she would mark the top-ranked runs as selected in order to track their new ranks after adjusting the weights of the financial objectives. She could also directly compare multiple objective prioritizations by creating and comparing multiple Simulation Ranking Views, each one with a different objective weight distribution. She could check, how the cost of local indicators is distributed among the surfaces in the scene by setting, e.g., the working area as the spatial focus. Further, she could manipulate a run, e.g., by dimming the wattage and energy consumption, and see in which respect the resulting lower illumination values and runtime costs would influence the ranking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">EVALUATION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Design Process</head><p>The design process of LiteVis can be described as an iterative cycle characterized by the three phases of (1) domain problem characterization, (2) data/operation abstraction, and (3) encoding/interaction technique design <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. For characterizing our collaborators' domain problem and refining our understanding of their workflow, we performed semi-structured interviews during small meetings. As we observed the lighting designers' accustomed workflow, contextual inquiries <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> helped us to clarify tasks and challenges. The study of lighting design literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> helped to increase our knowledge of the associated data. We presented the collective findings from this phase in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. While we were able to understand the overall goal of the lighting designers well, the most challenging part of this phase was to get a deep understanding of the nuances of each task, such as: what exactly are the independent degrees of freedom for parametrizing a scene, which particular aspects and metrics in the evaluation of a scene are considered relevant? The resulting data abstraction can be found in the end of Section 3.1, the problem abstraction is the subject of Section 3.4.</p><p>Parallel prototyping <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> of hand-drawn sketches enabled us to refine our understanding of the requirements and tasks, and to discuss and validate our abstractions with the experts. The Simulation Ranking View was subject to the most design iterations. The basic requirement of providing an overview of local result indicators on different aggregation levels was addressed already in the first visual prototype. However, the approach for ranking a large number of simulation runs by these indicators changed throughout the design process. An early version featured a transposable grid, but turned out to be cluttered and did not provide a sufficient overview. In the next iteration, we investigated an icicle plot layout where each leaf corresponded to a parametrization. The hierarchy levels represented groupings of parametrizations by input or output parameters, and encoded aggregates of the contained result indicators. This structure was still too rigid due to the inherent hierarchical grouping by input or output parameters. Finally, we decoupled the leaves from the hierarchy. The leaves, i.e., parametrizations, were listed as stacked bars in the Ranked <ref type="table">Table.</ref> The hierarchy was used to represent groups of measurement surfaces instead of parameters as a first version of the Spatial Hierarchy.</p><p>Once we settled on the design, we iteratively refined a software prototype and discussed the progress in monthly intervals with two to three domain experts. The overall design and implementation process took approximately 15 months. Important feedback during the design process concerned the automatic grouping of surfaces by type. Depending on the task, the experts considered other groupings more effective, e.g., by spatial proximity. We thus added the flexibility of grouping surfaces manually. Other feedback concerned the Spatial Hierarchy. The lighting designers had difficulties in understanding the relation between their interaction with surfaces in the Spatial Hierarchy and the resulting effect on the local objectives. The visual linking that we subsequently added alleviated this issue. Concerning the FCC, an initial version displayed a range around the target value for the involved parametrizations. However, the lighting designers stated that a range that includes values below the target was not helpful to them. The FCC therefore now only considers a range of values above the target by default. The range is adjustable as described in Section 4.4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">User Feedback</head><p>This section reports on user feedback collected during an evaluation workshop with three lighting design experts. Based on a protocol, we first gave an overview of the system and explained the individual components as well as their interplay. The demonstration was based on a dataset provided by our collaborators (Sec. 6). After two hours of introduction including questions and discussion, the domain experts used the system for another two hours including time for feedback and discussion. To document the feedback, participants completed a questionnaire with qualitative questions regarding the individual features.</p><p>The overall feedback of the interactive trial session was very positive. All experts agreed that analysis and comparison of parametrizations are key problems in the lighting design workflow. All of them considered LiteVis as an effective approach to increase efficiency and confidence in identifying relevant lighting parametrizations. The most appreciated component of the visual design included the Simulation Ranking View. The experts approved the design decisions of summarizing parametrizations by a combined score of aggregated result indicators as well as the interactive specification of measurement sur-face importance. Specifically, the ranking gives them "a never before envisioned overview of the quality of their simulation data". The specification of objectives concerning result indicators and measurement surface weights gives them "the necessary means to control and explore the massive amount of information". The head of lighting solutions support of our collaborator pointed out: "The system is very powerful and comprehensive. In particular the possibilities of an intuitive comparison of lighting solutions are a significant improvement as compared to other solutions that are currently deployed. It is exactly what we were looking for."</p><p>More critical feedback concerned the MSA in the spatial view. The experts commented that developing an intuition of the spatial illumination distribution based on the illumination histograms requires some time for familiarization. However, the lighting designers were generally able to understand the encoded illumination metrics and appreciated the feature for comparing the illumination distribution on individual measurement surfaces. In this regard, the FCC is considered as a useful complement to the abstract comparison of parametrizations in the Analysis Views and the MSA.</p><p>In summary, the discussions with the domain experts confirmed that we were able to meet our design goals. In fact, the lighting designers intend to incorporate LiteVis into their daily workflow. Discussions for a deployment of our prototype are already underway.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK 8.1 Goals</head><p>Summarizing the key components of LiteVis explains how our design corresponds to the goals stated in Section 3.3. We enable a holistic overview of all relevant features of the parameter space (G1), by linking the visualizations of the qualitative (Simulation View) and quantitative (Analysis Views) characteristics of input parametrizations and result indicators. Through this linked overview, it is not only easier for a designer to understand the results, but also to incorporate additional semantic information, customer requirements or prioritization concerns that are not included in the simulation itself. This linking also enables the tight integration of the scene parametrization with the evaluation of simulation results (G2) and thereby a more efficient feedback loop between these two tasks. The effective comparison of multiple solutions (G3) is enabled through the Analysis Views that can be flexibly adjusted to depict all sampled simulation runs based on their input and output values. This detailed comparison also enables a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of parameter variations. Especially our novel Simulation Ranking View provides explicit and reproducible decision support (G4) by clearly indicating the distributions of spatial and non-spatial objective weights and the resulting ranking scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2">Scalability</head><p>The scalability of our tool can be analyzed according to different aspects. The number of global and local indicators in the Simulation Ranking View's Indicator Bar is limited by the horizontal screen space. Due to the aggregation of local indicators, their number is independent from the number of measurement surfaces. Local indicators could be further aggregated into categories if they would occupy more than the available horizontal space. The number of surfaces in the Spatial Hierarchy is limited by the available screen space, as well. However, since they are hierarchically groupable, they could be managed in a sort of zoomable icicle plot. In large office scenes, the surfaces could go into the hundreds. However, these scenes are typically evenly structured, i.e., they consist of repeating patterns of furniture and lighting constellations. Measurement surfaces can therefore be grouped without losing valuable information. The number of solutions displayed in the Simulation Ranking View is not an issue concerning scalability as the most interesting ones (according to the specified objectives) are always ranked at the top. If an overview of hundreds or thousands of simulation runs is desired, a table lens could be used to gain a synopsis of all runs. Hierarchical grouping by parameters could be used to divide a large sample base of simulation runs. One part of LiteVis that does not scale well are the MSA. The annotations become cluttered when displaying more than 20 simulation runs. However, feedback from light-ing designers indicated that an in-depth comparison typically happens on a smaller set of runs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.3">General Applicability</head><p>The general applicability of concepts from LiteVis is given especially in our Simulation Ranking approach. It allows the specification of objectives on two orthogonal levels. This concept has general applicability in decision making, i.e., in cases where objectives can be shared by hierarchically superordinate entities. In disaster management, for instance, a simulation run can represent the results of a parametrizable flooding simulation. Instead of measurement surfaces, the Spatial Hierarchy could represent the evacuation prioritization of hierarchically groupable areas. Local indicators could represent different properties of these areas, such as the degree of damage, or repair cost.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.4">Future Work</head><p>Our evaluation indicates that the current version of LiteVis already has clear benefits compared to current decision-making support-tools in lighting design. In our discussions with domain experts, we identified additional topics to be addressed in the scope of LiteVis:</p><p>• More user guidance: the Spatial Hierarchy could be used to supply the user with more information about the parameter space. The cells in the Spatial Hierarchy could be colored to encode how much they contribute to the aggregate of a local indicator. Another idea would be to use the cells to encode how many places in the ranking the current selection would change if the respective cell would be assigned an importance value of 100%. • More control over spatial objectives: subdivision of measurement surfaces into sub-areas with individual spatial importances could help the lighting designer to fine-tune the specification of spatial optimality. On a desk, for instance, good illumination in the center is more important than at the corners. This is actually already possible but only in the setup phase (T0), i.e., when the measurement surfaces are defined. • Analysis of illumination over time: especially in out-door illumination scenarios, the sun plays an important role. Allowing users to analyze parametrizations at different times of day and to incorporate day-time dependent dimming profiles into this process, would be an interesting application area to explore.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we describe the LiteVis design study. LiteVis is a system aimed at assisting lighting designers in their decision making process in regard to finding an ideal lighting solution that adheres to competing qualitative and quantitative objectives. By integrating the spatial input domain of the parameter space with the abstract output domain of resulting simulation runs, we enable exploration and comparison of lighting parametrizations. We propose a novel ranking visualization that was inspired by multi-objective decision making solutions and takes into account the special intricacies of the domain's complex parameter space. A use case illustrates how LiteVis supports decision making in the context of a database of lighting solutions that would have overwhelmed lighting designers when using current state of the art lighting design solutions. We further gave a problem characterization of the application domain and reflected on our design process. Qualitative feedback from domain experts confirmed that we met our design goals and that lighting designers want to incorporate LiteVis into their daily workflow.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 4 .</head><label>4</label><figDesc>The Simulation Ranking View: The Spatial Hierarchy (a) allows the user to specify the individual importance per measurement surface and to select a subset of surfaces (colored in red) for detailed inspection.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_3"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>A goal of LiteVis is to enable a direct comparison of simulated illuminations as well as of indicators regarding illumination quality and monetary costs. This includes enabling a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of parameter variations. • G4 -Explicit and reproducible decision support: Different measurement surfaces typically have different target values for their illumination indicators as well as different importances in general. For example, the illumination quality on a table surface is more important than on a wall. Current tools consider neither distances from local target values, nor semantic importance factors. Moreover, different stakeholders may put more emphasis either on qualitative or on financial aspects. A key goal of Lite-Vis is therefore to support reproducible decision making based on an explicit preference specification for illumination-related as well as cost-related indicators. A related goal and a prerequisite is to enable the specification of target values for indicators.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>
