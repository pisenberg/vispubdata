<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Visualisation helps analysts to understand and explain complex data. However, there exist factors that limit the amount of information that can be visualised. Scaling to a large number of data elements is a major issue in visualisation design. Eick and Karr <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[23]</ref> discuss how human perception, monitor resolution, visual metaphors, interactivity, data structures and algorithms, as well as computational infrastructure affect visual scalability. For network visualisation, the last five factors have been well explored <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[36]</ref>. However, scalability of human perception remains under-studied. A recent survey of 152 experimental studies of node-link visualisation techniques found that most of the networks considered in these studies were relatively small and sparse <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[66]</ref>. The survey authors called for studies that control the size and complexity of Here we address perceptual scalability of node-link diagrams, which are undoubtedly the most common way of visualising networks. Surveys like that of Jankun et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[36]</ref> speak about the so-called 'hair-ball effect', wherein, node-link diagram representations of larger smallworld or scale-free graphs are no longer useful for understanding the connectivity of all but peripheral nodes in the visualisation. Previous studies suggest that, while matrix-based representations are more effective than node-link diagrams for some tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">49]</ref>, node-link diagrams are superior for connectivity tasks. For this reason we focus on the scalability of node-link diagrams for a widely used connectivity task, that of finding the shortest-path between two nodes.</p><p>We conducted an experiment in which 22 participants found the length of the shortest path between two nodes on 42 small-world networks, ranging from 25 to 175 nodes with three levels of density. In addition to task completion speed, accuracy and self-reported difficulty, we also collected physiological measures known to be associated with mental effort: brain electrical activity (EEG), heart rate, and pupil size. This is the first study that we know of to provide a holistic analysis across subjective, physiological as well as performance measurements for a network visualisation task. Our main contributions are as follows.</p><p>1. We establish that the usefulness of node-link diagrams for finding shortest paths quickly deteriorates as the number of nodes and edges increases-as discussed in Section 4. For small-world graphs with 50 or more nodes and a density (ratio of edges to nodes) of 6, participants were unable to correctly answer in more than half of the trials. This was also the case for graphs with a density of 2 and more than 100 nodes. 2. We provide an analysis of the relationship between task hardness and the physiological measures of cognitive load-see Section <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">5</ref>. We found that these measures of load increased with task hardness until a threshold is reached, after which it decreases, suggesting that participants give up. This analysis relied on combining accuracy and self-reported difficulty to give a single measure of task hardness for each of the 42 stimuli. 3. We make an initial identification of brain regions associated with a network visualisation task-in Section 5.2-and reveal functional differences in brain activity between hard and easy tasks. Here we used self-reported difficulty. 4. We explored the effects of global network layout features (such as size or number of crossings) and features of the shortest path (such as length or straightness) on task difficulty. We found that global features generally had a greater impact on hardness than those of the shortest path-see Section 6. 5. Furthermore, measuring cognitive load through physiological measures requires careful setup and analysis. We believe that our experience and methodology will inform future visualisation researchers who also wish to use such measures to evaluate cognitive load for other kinds of visualisation tasks-Section 7. Our research adds to the understanding of the perceptual scalability of node-link diagrams. It informs visualisation designers about the size of network for which node-link diagrams are appropriate and at what point the number of nodes and links displayed to the user should be limited, e.g., through filtering or aggregation techniques. It also helps to clarify the visual features that layout algorithms should focus on to improve usability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Network Visualisation Effectiveness Studies</head><p>Task performance-accuracy and/or response time-is the standard measure of visualisation efficiency used across many network visualisation studies. There has been a lot of research exploring the effects of layout features of node-link diagrams on task effectiveness, many of which use shortest-path finding as a task <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">55]</ref>. In particular, a study by Ware et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[63]</ref> explores the effects of different layout features on response time in a shortest-path finding task on node-link diagrams, which they attribute to 'cognitive cost'. Their results indicate that the number of hops on the shortest path is the highest contributor to cognitive cost, followed by the straightness of the shortest path.</p><p>A number of empirical studies compare node-link diagrams with alternate visualisation types and techniques. For example, Ghoniem et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[28]</ref> compare the effectiveness of node-link diagrams with adjacency matrices for various tasks. The study is unusual in testing relatively dense graphs, e.g., up to 100 nodes and 3,600 edges. For such graphs they found matrices provided better support than node-link diagrams for many tasks, the exception being path finding, which remains very difficult in matrices regardless of density.</p><p>A recent survey of network visualisation user studies has explored the literature in terms of number of nodes and edges used in published studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[66]</ref>. While there are many studies evaluating different representations of network data, these rarely significantly vary the size of the data, preferring one or two data sets, carefully chosen to be well within the capabilities of at least one of the techniques being tested (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">57]</ref>). We are aware of a few studies that involve large graphs (e.g., hundreds or thousands of nodes) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">62]</ref>, but they all use interactive query or aggregation techniques, allowing the user to filter the input graph, so that only a small subset of the nodes and links are actually shown to the participant.</p><p>There is, therefore, a lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness of large node-link or other network visualisations for tasks that require a detailed understanding of the network structure. This work aims to determine the thresholds for node-link visualisations after which designers should limit the number of nodes and edges on display or switch to a summary representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[67]</ref> in order to best cater for human perceptual and cognitive capabilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Cognitive Load</head><p>Cognitive Load Theory suggests that humans process information using limited working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[59]</ref>. The theory was initially developed in the fields of education and instructional design. It distinguishes between intrinsic, extraneous, and germane cognitive load. Intrinsic cognitive load is associated with the inherent difficulty of the instruction or task. Extraneous cognitive load depends on how the instruction and information is presented, while germane cognitive load refers to processing, acquiring and automating schemata <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">60]</ref>. Three main types of measures can be used to assess cognitive load: subjective feedback, performance-based (accuracy and response time), and physiological <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[21]</ref> such as brain activity, pupil dilation or heart rate variability.</p><p>Only one study (to our knowledge) has directly used cognitive load as a measure to evaluate network visualisations. Huang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[33]</ref> conducted a study that explored cognitive load in node-link diagrams. They utilised an efficiency measure based on the approach proposed by Paas and Van Merrienboer <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[51]</ref> for comparing instructional materials which combines self-reported mental effort and performance measures. Huang et al. manipulated complexities of the visual representation, data, and task, to show that cognitive load is affected by these factors. Their results confirmed that the participant feedback matched their expectations in terms of task difficulty. However, the graphs they used were fairly small and they did not consider physiological measures of cognitive load.</p><p>Even though physiological measures have been frequently used to measure cognitive load in systems engineering and psychology, to our knowledge, there have been very few studies that use physiological measures to evaluate data visualisations and no studies that utilise them to measure the effectiveness of network visualisations. Instead researchers have almost totally relied on performance-based and subjective measures.</p><p>An exception is Anderson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[6]</ref> who compared the cognitive load of participants when identifying the larger interquartile range on a variation of box plot types. They measured task difficulty, response time and brain activity using EEG. They used the spectral differences in the alpha and theta frequency bands of the signals acquired by EEG as an indicator of cognitive load. The results showed a correlation between these three measures, with an increase in response time and cognitive load as tasks became more difficult.</p><p>In another study Peck et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[53]</ref> used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to compare the cognitive load imposed by pie charts versus bar charts. They also used accuracy, response time, and subjective feedback (NASA-TLX). They asked participants to estimate differences between two highlighted sections, given either a pie or bar chart. The results did not show a difference in cognitive load between the two visualisation idioms. This is perhaps attributable to the task not really involving problem solving, but relying mostly on visual perception.</p><p>One contribution of this paper is our initial exploration of the applicability of different physiological measures to network visualisation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">EEG Measurement of Cognitive Load</head><p>Quantitative EEG is the broad name given to the analysis of brain electrical activity with respect to its oscillations, or frequency components. Data is collected from electrodes placed in a standard configuration on the surface of the head-see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Generally speaking, brain electrical oscillations occurring between 4 and 8 Hertz, called theta activity, have been associated with memory processing, such as during memory encoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[42]</ref>, recognition or processing during spatial navigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[65]</ref> and other related processes including error detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[61]</ref>.</p><p>Theta activity is also commonly used to measure cognitive load. Increased activity is associated with increased cognitive load processing and task difficulty, typically at the central frontal lobe electrodes, FZ <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[19]</ref>. However, the region of the brain associated with increased activity depends upon the kind of task. For instance, a linguistic (i.e., hypertext) based task highlighted electrodes F7 and P3 as being more important <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[7]</ref>.</p><p>Briefly, whilst brain regions do not typically work in isolation, different brain areas have different roles. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>  reward and error processing, impulse control, decision making, problem solving and abstract reasoning, motivation, language production, and motor planning, control and execution. The parietal lobe is generally involved in touch sensation, as well as visuo-spatial processing and perception, including mental imagery. The temporal lobe is involved in auditory sensation, object recognition, memory, language comprehension, and emotions. Finally, at the rear of the brain, the occipital cortex is involved in lower-level visual processing.</p><p>As no previous study has investigated brain activity for a network visualisation task, it is difficult to predict precisely which areas of the brain and hence electrodes will be involved. For instance, finding the shortest path could involve memory encoding, decision making (including error detection), and spatial processing, within what is a predominately spatial navigation decision task. A spatial navigation task in the literature implicated right temporal and bilateral parietooccipital theta increases, with left posterior decreases <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[65]</ref>. However, this task is a less than ideal comparison because it did not manipulate cognitive load.</p><p>The brain imaging study with the most similar task did not use EEG analysis. Instead, it used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to detect oxygen/blood flow in the brain as a measure of activity. Kaplan and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[39]</ref> sought to identify regions of brain activity during a maze processing task. Participants were required to decide what was the shortest path between their starting point and an end location. Some mazes only had one choice point, while others had two choice points when deciding the shortest path. Their results suggested that there were brain activity differences depending on the number of decisions. These results suggest that shortest path tasks could involve theta activity in the left-frontal, right-parietal, and left-temporal regions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">USER STUDY</head><p>Our study was designed to investigate the perceptual scalability of node-link diagrams for graph connectivity tasks, identifying the graph complexity and size beyond which they cease to be useful for such tasks. This extends previous studies such as <ref type="bibr">Ware [63]</ref> by considering a much greater range of graph sizes and densities. We also explore physiological measures of cognitive load: EEG, pupil dilation and heart rate variability. <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>: One of the participants during the study (face obscured for anonymity) wearing the g.Nautilus EEG cap.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Setup</head><p>Participants. The study had 22 participants: 14 male, 8 female. 18 participants were in age range 20-30, while 4 were aged 35-45. All participants had a background in Computer Science. The participants were asked about their familiarity with node-link diagrams and the shortest path problem. 9 participants frequently encountered nodelink diagrams and the shortest path problem, while the remaining 13 participants occasionally did. Task. We chose a network connectivity task because this is a common high-level task and node-link diagrams have been found to be particularly effective for this task <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[28]</ref>. Specifically, participants were shown a range of graphs and instructed to identify the shortest path between two highlighted nodes and determine the number of nodes on this path, if they could. Graph corpus. The graphs shown to the participants varied in two dimensions; numbers of nodes and edge density. Of course, other aspects of the graph structure can be expected to affect task complexity. However, to keep our study under two hours we were forced to consider only a single type of graph structure. We wanted our generated graphs to be similar to real-world graphs. We chose to use the Barabási-Albert model <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[9]</ref> as this is known to produce graphs with small-world characteristics. Such graphs are common in nature and are frequently studied, e.g., in cell-biology <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[5]</ref>, bibliography <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[25]</ref> and internet topology <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[24]</ref>.</p><p>We generated our stimuli using code written in JavaScript and based on the Barabási-Albert <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[9]</ref> model. We preferred not to use standard generators, since most require parameters specifying the total number of nodes and the number of edges to added at each iteration. Instead, we wanted to specify the total number of nodes and edges.</p><p>The number of nodes in the generated graphs ranged from 25 to 175 nodes in increments of 25. We experimented with different nodes ranges, but our pilot studies showed that task accuracy was at a maximum at 25 nodes, while the task was too difficult at 175 nodes. To calculate the edges, we used densities of 2, 4 and 6, where density = number of edges/number of nodes. We chose these densities because real-world examples often have densities of less than 10 <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[46]</ref> and the results of our pilot studies showed that the graphs became unreadable beyond these values. We generated two graphs for each combination of number of nodes and density, giving 42 graphs, plus 3 graphs for training. The graphs were arranged using the forcedirected layout of WebCola [4] and saved as drawings in SVG format.</p><p>For each graph we computed a start and end node of the path. We first selected the furthest node from the centre of the diagram and then selected the nearest node to the opposite side of the vector, passing through the centre. Due to the small-world nature of the graphs and the force-directed layout, this led to non-trivial shortest paths. Equipment. The study was conducted in a quiet office at Monash University with no natural light variation. The set up is depicted in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. The study was run on a Windows 10 Dell Latitude E7440 laptop, equipped with 2.7 GHz i7 processor and 8 GB RAM. The visual representations were displayed in a 1920 × 1080 pixel area on a 22-inch HP monitor. Mozilla Firefox 46.0 was used to to display the visualisations and collect participant responses.</p><p>A Tobii Pro X3-120 eye tracker [3] was used throughout the study. This was directly linked to the laptop.</p><p>A Polar H10 heart rate sensor was used to acquire heart rate information. This was linked to an iPhone 4 via Bluetooth and HRV Logger [2].</p><p>A g.Nautilus [1] electroencephalography (EEG) cap was also linked to the laptop to record the electrical activity of the brain via g.Recorder; a software provided by g.tec <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. The cap exposes 32 data channels with dry electrodes spatially organised, based on the International 10-20 EEG placement system, with Modified Combinatorial Nomenclature as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Additional reference and ground electrodes were attached to the back of the participants' ears. The EEG sampling was set to 250 Hz. An analogue bandpass filter was applied between 0.5 Hz and 100 Hz. A notch filter was used to suppress 48 Hz to 52 Hz power line interference. Sensitivity was set to +/-2250 mV.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Procedure</head><p>The participants were shown an explanatory statement and were asked to sign a consent form. They were then presented with a short tutorial explaining the concept of shortest path and the task requirements.</p><p>For each experimental task, the start and end pair of nodes were highlighted in orange and participants were asked to find the shortest path, taking note of the number of nodes between these end nodes. The correct answers for our tasks ranged from one to six. We also allowed participants to answer with 'unsure' so that they did not need to guess. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 10</ref>(a) for an example of the task. Both the answer and the time taken were recorded.</p><p>Each participant had to perform the task 45 times, of which 3 were training. The stimuli were shown in randomised order such that no consecutive graph contained the same number of nodes or number of edges. All graphs were shown to each participant using this order but starting with a different graph, resulting in an incomplete Latin Square design. Each task was preceded by five seconds of blank screen to serve as a rest period, which also served as baseline for the physiological measures.</p><p>After each task, the participants were asked to rate its difficulty. They were given a nine-grade symmetrical category scale used by Huang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[33]</ref> and evaluated by Bratfisch et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[12]</ref>. The scale uses the following terms: 'very very easy', 'very easy', 'easy', 'rather easy', 'neither easy nor difficult', 'rather difficult', 'difficult', 'very difficult', 'very very difficult'.</p><p>The participants were allowed to take breaks between each task. The breaks were not timed and the respective physiological measures were excluded from the analysis. Moreover, no fatigue was reported, or signs of fatigue observed.</p><p>Unlike Ghoniem et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[28]</ref> who allowed the participants to interact with the visualisation by highlighting neighbouring nodes when hovering over a specific node, we did not allow any interaction. We wanted to keep the variables of the study at a minimum in order to understand the basics of cognitive load and scalability. Even though the participants had access to a mouse, they were asked not to use it during the task, and only used it to submit their answers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">PERFORMANCE AND SUBJECTIVE MEASURES</head><p>Our dependent measures fall into three categories: performance (completion time and accuracy), subjective (self-reported difficulty) and physiological (pupil dilation, heart rate and EEG). The overall logic of our data analysis is 1. Determine scalability of the task in terms of performance and subjective measures. 2. Develop a measure of task hardness for each of the stimuli based on performance and subjective measures. 3. Determine which regions of the brain are involved for the EEG analysis. 4. Investigate the relationship between hardness and the physiological measures of cognitive load.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Explain hardness in terms of graph metrics.</head><p>In this section we focus on the first two steps.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Scalability</head><p>Figures 4, 5 and 6 respectively show the self-reported difficulty, accuracy and response time of the participants in seconds with respect to each stimulus. Stimuli are grouped by density.</p><p>We used repeated measures correlation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[37]</ref> to investigate the correlation between these measures and the number of nodes overall and for each density. Difficulty: Overall, there is a strong correlation between number of nodes and self-reported difficulty: We weighted correct as 0, incorrect as 1. It is less clear how to weigh unsure. We cannot remove them entirely as failure to complete the task is an important signifier of task difficulty. One could argue that an unsure response indicates that the participant found it harder than those who gave an incorrect answer, as even with the wrong answer they at least felt that they could answer the question. We evaluated the effect on correlation (see supplementary materials). With a weight of 1 for unsure the correlation is 0.42. Correlation increases to 0.55 with a weight of 2 and then levels out. We therefore decided to weigh unsure as 2. Note that we redid the analysis for weighing unsure as 1 and it makes little difference (see supplementary materials).  .07], p = 0.4592. One reason for this is might be that with the larger and denser examples participants quickly realise that the task is too difficult and select 'unsure' actually reducing their response time. For this reason we also checked the correlation when times for unsure responses were excluded. As expected this strengthens the correlation. What is striking about these results is how hard participants find the task. Participants are: wrong or unsure more than 50% of the time for graphs with 100 or more nodes for density 2; they are wrong or unsure more than 50% of the time for graphs with 75 or more nodes for density 4 and wrong or unsure more than 50% of the time for graphs with 50 or more nodes for density 6. Indeed for density 6 and graphs with 75 or more nodes participant accuracy is around 16.67%, the value we would expect by random selection.</p><p>Our results strongly suggest that for path-based connectivity tasks node-link diagrams do not scale. Even for low-density graphs we find that determining shortest paths is only reasonable for graphs with less than 100 nodes and for higher-density graphs no more than 50 nodes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Task Hardness</head><p>For the subsequent analyses it is useful to have a single measure of the task hardness for each of the stimuli (graph and shortest path). Of course we don't have a direct measure of this but accuracy, response time and self-reported difficulty are all possible proxy measures with task hardness an underlying latent variable. There are a number of ways to do latent variable analysis. Basically the observed variables are modelled as linear combinations of the potential latent variables, plus "error" terms. We used Principal Axis Factoring to extract the latent variable as it is one of the standard techniques used in psychological data analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">38]</ref>. Based on the prior discussion we chose not to use response times for unsure responses.</p><p>The analysis had three steps. 1. We first normalised the measures for each participant in order to better take account of individual differences. The normalised score was simply the z-score of the measure w.r.t. all responses of the participant. 2. For each normalised measure we calculated the mean score for all participants for each of the 42 items (questions). 3. We then conducted Principal Axis Factoring, with the first principal component giving an estimate of task hardness. This indicated that 78% of the variance in responses can be explained by task hardness and that the factor loadings for difficulty, accuracy and time were 1.04, 0.87 and 0.71 respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES OF COGNITIVE LOAD</head><p>In the next part of our analysis we explored the relationship between task difficulty and the physiological measures of cognitive load.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Data Preprocessing</head><p>Pupil Dilation: We used Tobii Studio to record the eye tracker data from the Tobii Pro X3-120. We used the average of the two eyes in order to reduce noise. In cases where we had pupil size information for just one eye, we used that alone. For each task, we used the five seconds pre-task resting period to extract an average baseline, then we calculated pupil dilation by subtracting the average pupil size during the inter-trial rest period from the peak pupil size during task performance. We used peak dilation instead of mean pupil dilation since the latter does not work well with tasks that vary in length across participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[10]</ref>. We used z-score to normalise the pupil dilation for each participant. Heart Rate Variability: The polar H10 heart rate monitor recorded the beats per minute (bpm) and r-r interval for each participant. We used root mean squared successive difference (RMSSD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">58]</ref> which is a common measure for heart rate variability analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[56]</ref> and used z-score to normalise this for each participant.</p><p>EEG: G.tec's g.Nautilis dry 32 channel EEG system was used to record and digitise EEG using g.Recorder. Online, left ground and right reference ears were used in accordance to technical recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[30]</ref>. Raw EEG was converted to a format compatible with and then analysed using Fieldtrip <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[50]</ref> within MATLAB. Offline pre-processing consisted of re-referencing to the electrode average. Afterwards, the data was first visualised so that bad electrodes could be identified and interpolated using symmetrically chosen electrodes within a 5 cm radius. EEG data pre-processing continued after using a 1 to 30 hertz FIR band pass filter on whole data, using a hamming, 53dB/octave slope. These filters allowed a reduction of slow wave potentials whilst keeping the traditional shape of the eye blink response. Otherwise, this range was chosen to attenuate a level of noise associated with signals outside the range of frequency interest for this study whilst maintaining the ability to visualise muscle activity for later epoch rejection. After this, PCA ocular correction algorithms were performed on whole data to remove blinks and eye movements from the EEG data. Each participant's data was epoched for 5 seconds before the point where a participant signalled they had an answer. This was decided because there was a large variation in individual response times, with some trials taking over 2 minutes. This variability meant there was no guarantee that participants were concentrating for the entire time. We felt that epoching the 5 seconds prior to indicating an answer meant that the EEG results would be more comparable across trials and participants, as, at this point in time, they were more likely to be fully engaged in the task (see supplementary materials for further discussion).</p><p>We chose to analyse theta frequencies as theta power has been more consistently found to increase with cognitive load than other frequencies such as alpha whose power has been found to both increase and decrease with cognitive load <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[15]</ref>. Therefore, after epoching, FFT was performed on each stimuli, exporting 4 to 7.8 hertz as absolute power, using intervals of 0.2 and a 1 Hz taper.</p><p>The data was converted into z-scores to normalise between participants. Despite the cleaning algorithms, EEG outliers were found in the data that seemingly related to the amplification of noise, which did not seem to have any particular pattern within and between participants. To overcome this, it was decided to use the non-parametric estimates (i.e., median rather than mean) in all analyses involving EEG data.</p><p>Trouble was found with two participants' EEG data-one participant's recording dropped out during online recording, and the other had reference problems-leaving EEG data from twenty participants for analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">EEG Analysis</head><p>As discussed in Section 2, different regions of the brain are associated with different functions. As a first step in our analysis of the EEG data we wished to determine which regions were involved in the shortest path task.</p><p>For each participant we split the stimuli into easy and hard tasks based on the individual participant's subjective ranking. We used the individual subjective ranking rather than the task hardness as we felt that this would better reflect the difficulty that that individual found with the stimuli. Even if a stimuli was generally found hard it could be that some participants found it easy just because they were lucky and happened to quickly see the shortest path. We then computed the median theta power for the easy and hard stimuli at the different electrode locations, giving the EEG topographical maps shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>For the easy tasks the main activation is at the rear of the brain and slightly to the right in the parietal and occipital regions. There is also activation in the temporal region and little activity elsewhere. This pattern is similar to that previously found for spatial navigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[65]</ref>. It suggests that the decision making for these tasks is essentially visuospatial and that during their final decision, participants mostly relied on perceptually estimating the length of all possible routes.</p><p>On the other hand, when we look at the activation for hard instances there is activity on both sides of the occipital and parietal cortex and the right parietal and frontal regions and the left frontal region. This pattern of activation is more similar to that found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[39]</ref>. It suggests that for these stimuli a much more systematic step-by-step process is being used to find the shortest path with participants keeping track of the best path found so far in memory for comparison with the path under consideration.</p><p>These distinctions are evident in the difference EEG topographical map. Increased activation in the left parieto-occipital region for the harder instances is conjectured to reflect greater use of memory and pattern recognition (i.e., comparing the memory trace of the current path to previously considered paths <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[35]</ref>, and/or possibly pattern recognition more broadly when considering the role of the posterior temporal lobe <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[27]</ref>. On the other hand, the centro-parietal activity on the right hand side could represent the specialisation of the right ventro-parietal cortex for non-language-based spatial tasks, reflecting attention processing that also includes memory processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">40]</ref>. Finally, the frontal region activity on the left side is probably explained by traditional cognitive load theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">19]</ref> and reflects semantic encoding and possibly retrieval processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">64]</ref> and working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">14]</ref>.</p><p>This analysis and the difference map suggests that electrodes in the left frontal region (F3, FC1), right centro-parietal (C4, CP2, CP6) and left parieto-occipital (PO7, P7) are the most likely electrodes to indicate increased cognitive load for our task. That said, noteworthy trace activation was also found in the right frontal region (F4) but not as strong as the other electrodes previously mentioned. We used the Wilcoxon signed rank test to evaluate the effect of easy vs. hard. We also calculated the r effect size of these tests. We can interpret the r effect size using Cohen's classification of effect sizes which is 0.1 (small effect), 0.3 (moderate effect) and 0.5 and above (large effect) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[17]</ref>. We note that the differences for these electrodes between the hard and easy stimuli are statistically significant and all have large effects: F3 (p = .0066, r = .62), FC1 (p = .0034, r = .66), F4 (p = .0182, r = .55), C4 (p = .0056, r = .63), CP2 (p = .0077, r = .61), CP6 (p = .0023, r = .68), P4 (p = .0056, r = .63), PO7 (p = .0001, r = .81), P7 (p = .0028, r = .67).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Correlation with Task Difficulty</head><p>We next used repeated measures correlation to investigate the correlation between the physiological measures discussed above and the task hardness. We did not include unsure responses. For EEG data, we considered theta for the electrodes identified in the previous section (F3, FC1, F4, C4, CP2, CP6, P4, PO7, P7). <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows only pupil dilation and heart rate variability demonstrated a statistically significant positive correlation with hardness. Even then the correlations were not strong based on their correlation coefficients. This lack of correlation was surprising as we would have expected cognitive load to be highly correlated with task difficulty.</p><p>In order to better understand the relationship between the physiological measures and task hardness, we binned the measurements using a quantile interval (i.e. each category contains an equal number of tasks) method to divide the range of hardnesss into five categories from easy to hard. We then plotted the 95% CI of each measure as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figures 7 and 8</ref>.</p><p>We see for pupil dilation and for most of the EEG measures (F3, FC1, CP2, CP6, P4, PO7, P7) that they first increase with task hardness but then decrease. This is why they exhibit only a weak correlation with task hardness. We conjecture that this is because once the task becomes very difficult participants switch off and no longer make the effort to find the right answer so cognitive load actually decreases. While we might have expected this for the unsure answers, our results suggest that this happens even if the participants do not indicate they are unsure. For heart rate the story is not so straightforward but may be because heart rate is also influenced by stress and so participants' cognitive load decreased but stress was increased resulting in the overall increase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">GRAPH AND LAYOUT FEATURES AFFECTING TASK HARD-NESS</head><p>Clearly the size/complexity of the underlying graph affects the difficulty of finding the shortest path. As discussed in Section 2 a number of papers have suggested other features that impact on this: length, i.e., number of nodes on the shortest path <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[63]</ref>, number of crossings and  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Correlation between physiological measures and hardness. <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>: Pupil dilation and heart rate variability as a function of task hardness.</p><p>crossing angle on the shortest path <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">63]</ref>, directness of shortest path <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[63]</ref>, and degree of nodes on the shortest path <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[63]</ref>. Given that we have a measure of task hardness we decided to conduct an analysis investigating how different features of the overall graph and of the shortest path(s) between the two target nodes affected task hardness. As our stimuli had not been designed to directly answer this question our analysis is necessarily limited but is still illuminating.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Graph and Layout Features</head><p>One limitation of the stimuli is that most of them contained more than one shortest path. Therefore, for most features we provide both the total value over all of the shortest paths and the average value overall all shortest paths. We would expect the first value to be more highly correlated if participants examine all shortest paths but the second to be more highly correlated if they only examine one (or few) of the shortest paths. We also consider a global measure of crossings, e.g. the total number of crossings. The rational for this is that other paths in the graph must be examined to complete the task, not just the shortest path itself. In some cases it is unclear how best to measure a particular feature so we used a number of metrics. The complete list of metrics is: Measures of size/complexity:  • sCrossingAngle: overall sum of the angles at which links cross on the shortest paths • dsCrossingAngle: average sum of the angles at which links cross on the shortest paths Length of shortest path:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">•</formula><p>• LengthOfShortestPath: Number of nodes on the shortest path • sEuclidean: total Euclidean distance of shortest paths • dsEuclidean: average Euclidean distance of shortest paths Degrees of nodes on the shortest path:</p><p>• sDegrees: total sum of the degrees of nodes on the shortest paths • dsDegrees: average total sum of the degrees of nodes on the shortest paths Straightness of shortest path:</p><p>• sEquator: total geodesic path deviation on the shortest paths • dsEquator: avg. total geodesic path deviation on shortest paths • sTurningAngle: sum of turning angles on the shortest paths • dsTurningAngle: avg. sum of turning angles on shortest paths The penalty for small angles was calculated by measuring the angle between two link crossings and subtracting it from 90 degrees. This applies a high penalty for small angles, but a small penalty for crossings where the links are close to orthogonal. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 10</ref> shows examples where some of these features are highlighted. The graph shown in the examples is from our study corpus. It has 6 possible shortest paths ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 10(a)</ref>), each with 4 intermediate nodes. The nodes on the shortest paths have an accumulated degree of 56 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 10(h)</ref>, average = 28.33/path). The node-link diagram representing the graph has 57 link-link crossings <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">(Fig. 10(b)</ref>) and 6 node-link crossings <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">(Fig. 10(c)</ref>). There are 33 link-link crossings ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 10(d)</ref>, average = 8.33/path) and 1 node-link crossing ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 10(e)</ref>, average = 0.17/path) on the shortest paths. The sum of the Euclidean distance of the links on the shortest paths is 2803.66 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 10(f)</ref>, average = 1067.47/path). The sum of the distance between the nodes on the shortest paths from the Geodesic path is 874.46 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 10(g)</ref>, average = 415.66/path). The sum of the penalty for small angles of link-link crossings on the shortest paths is 925.92 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 10(i)</ref>, average = 217.08/path). Lastly, the sum of the turning angles on the shortest paths is 426.72 degrees ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 10(j)</ref>, average = 105.58 degrees).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Analysis</head><p>As a first step we computed the correlation between these different measures and also with task hardness. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 9</ref>. As one would expect the different measures of the same basic feature are often closely correlated. Thus, for instance the measures of crossings and crossing angle are highly correlated. Furthermore, as the graph grows the number of node-link and link-link crossings increase. We also see that measures of the Euclidean length of the shortest path(s), its straightness and the degree of the nodes on it are all highly correlated.</p><p>We then built multi-level linear models to understand how the above graph features influence task hardness (a similar approach was employed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[63]</ref>). This exploratory study used all-subsets methods to consider different combinations of features as predictors. Following Field et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chap 7</ref>.9], we only considered models meeting the following assumptions:</p><p>• Limited multicollinearity; we used the VIF statistics to calculate VIF values and we considered V IF &lt; 5 as meet the requirement.  • Homoscedasticity (means that residuals at each level of the predictors should have the same variance): different transformations were applied to different graph metrics before building the linear models to meet this requirement: log transformation: gLLCrossingCount, gCrossingAngle, sLL-CrossingCount, sCrossingAngle, dsCrossingAngle, sEuclidean, dsEuclidean, sDegrees and dsDegrees. square root transformation: gLNCrossingCount, dsLNCross-ingCount, sEquator, dsEquator, sTurningAngle, dsTurningAngle. 4th square root transformation: gCrossingCount, sLNCross-ingCount and dsLLCrossingCount. Density was excluded from modelling as the transformed values still did not meet the homoscedasticity assumption. We also normalised each input factor to 0-1 range before modelling.</p><p>We report representative models for different number of predictors. Those for one predictor are, of course, the features most highly correlated with task hardness. The top 12 models are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>. What we see is that the number of nodes and global measures of crossing angle or crossing count are the best predictors, followed by number of edges and measures of crossing angle and count for the shortest path. Other features associated with the shortest path such as its length or straightness are poor predictors of task hardness.</p><p>The top 12 models for two predictors are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref>. Here we see that the best model combines global measures of crossing angle or crossing count with the length of the shortest path. The next best combine global measures of crossing angle or crossing count with measures of the number of nodes or graph density. These are followed by predictors combining global measures of crossings with local measures of crossings on the shortest paths.</p><p>We also considered models with three predictors but none had sufficient extra explanatory power to warrant the use of a third predictor.</p><p>What we see is that the global graph features are much better predictors of task hardness than features of the shortest path(s). This is a little surprising, likely reflecting that the participants looked at many more      paths than the shortest one or because in the stimuli the shortest path was deliberately constructed to run from one side of the graph to the other. We also see that the best combination of two predictors utilise global measures of crossings with either the number of nodes or the number of nodes on the shortest path.</p><p>The most similar study is that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[63]</ref>. They also studied the effect of different graph features on the difficulty of finding the shortest path. They evaluated the effect of shortest path length (number of nodes) and its Euclidean length, shortest path straightness, degree of nodes on shortest path, number of crossings and average crossing angles on shortest path, as well as the global number of crossings. They did not vary the number of nodes in the stimuli or consider density or number of edges. They found that the two best predictors were shortest path length and straightness of the path. In particular they found that the global number of crossings was not a good predictor but that the number of crossings on the shortest path was. This contrasts with our finding that global predictors such as number of nodes or number of crossings are more influential than number of crossings or straightness of the shortest path. We believe this is because the graphs used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[63]</ref> were small-only 42 nodes-and relatively sparse with only a few crossings. Consequently the task was much easier: 93% of responses were correct. We suspect that this means that the participants quickly found the shortest path and so its features dominated, while in our harder experiment participants considered many other paths to the shortest path and so global features were more important.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>Our study had a number of limitations. The first is that it was restricted to scale-free graphs and that we used a particular layout algorithm. While we believe that our results apply generally to node-link diagrams, further studies are required to validate this. We considered only one task: finding the shortest path between two nodes. We believe that this complex task is representative of a wide-range of path following tasks and that it involves a variety 'sub-tasks', such as dis-ambiguating edges, inspecting neighbours, remembering previously inspected nodes, browsing through paths, and so on. Nonetheless other tasks should be considered in future work.</p><p>We also realised a number of limitations of the study with respect to our measurement and analysis of the physiological data. Measurements of pupil dilation are sensitive to illumination <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[10]</ref>. A limitation of this study was not considering the effect of the stimuli on illumination. With larger or denser graphs the screen is slightly darker, reducing illumination and so increasing pupil dilation. This could potentially explain some of the increase in pupil dilation as task difficulty increased. However, we believe the impact was minimal as the study was conducted in a well-lit office and we actually see that pupil dilation decreased when the stimuli became sufficiently difficult. Whilst the brain activity patterns revealed in the EEG data accord with the limited available literature, these results should be viewed cautiously. Not only was there a significant level of noise in the data but the EEG results are likely to be more nuanced. In particular, we ignored individual strategy differences or spatial abilities which are likely to significantly impact on the brain regions used in the task. While participants were instructed not to use the mouse while completing the task, a few participants began to use the mouse to trace over the path before being asked not to. This may have resulted in a greater amount of motor, and more importantly, pre-motor cortex activity on the opposite brain hemisphere to the hand being used. This could have resulted in minor differences in brain activity between the easy and hard stimuli in left frontal-central regions, if the right hand was used more with the mouse. However we see little indication of this. Future studies, should take steps to ensure that participants are not able to use the mouse.</p><p>It is also important to note the limitations of EEG analysis. While it gives a broad indication of brain activity it is not possible to confidently point out detailed brain regions from our results; source localisation techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[52]</ref> are required to allow certainty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSION</head><p>We have explored the perceptual limitations of node-link diagrams for a representative connectivity task, finding the shortest path between two nodes. We found that the usefulness of node-link diagrams rapidly deteriorates as the number of nodes and edges increases. For smallworld graphs with 50 or more nodes and a density (ratio of edges to nodes) of 6, participants were unable to correctly answer in more than half of the trials. This was also the case for graphs with a density of 2 and more than 100 nodes.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to consider physiological measures of cognitive load (EEG, pupil dilation and heart rate variation) for a network visualisation task. We found that these measures of load initially increase with task hardness but then decrease, presumably because participants give up. The analysis of EEG data was particularly revealing, indicating that the left frontal, right centroparietal and left parieto-occipital regions display increased cognitive load for our task. Trace activation was also found in the right frontal region. We hope that our experience will inform future visualisation researchers who also wish to use physiological measures to reveal cognitive load for other kinds of visualisation tasks.</p><p>We also explored the effects of global network layout features such as size or number of crossings and features of the shortest path such as length or straightness on task difficulty. We found that the global measures such as number of crossings had a greater impact than features of the shortest path such as straightness. This is in contrast to an earlier study of Ware <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[63]</ref> and may reflect the harder stimuli used in our study.</p><p>Our results can guide visualisation designers when creating visualisations that must scale to larger graph data (e.g., setting limits on neighbourhood size in overview-and-detail techniques using node-link diagrams for detail). We also hope this work stimulates development of new techniques that demonstrably scale to larger, more complex networks such as summary representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[67]</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 4 :</head><label>4</label><figDesc>Self-reported difficulty rating for the different sizes of graphs and densities.</figDesc></figure>
