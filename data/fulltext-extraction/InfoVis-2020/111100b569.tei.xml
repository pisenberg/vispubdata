<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Given a high dimensional dataset, one of the main visualization goals is to produce an embedding in 2D or 3D Euclidean space, that suitably captures pairwise relationships among the represented data. Dating back to the 1960s, a classical tool that is widely used for both graphs and high dimensional dataset visualization is Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), which aims to preserve the distances between all pairs of datapoints or nodes/objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[45]</ref>. Dimensionality reduction is a more general version of this problem, aiming to project a given dataset to a lower dimensional space. There are many popular algorithms for dimensionality reduction, from linear methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[23]</ref>, to non-linear methods such as t-SNE <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34]</ref> which captures local neighborhoods and clusters and UMAP <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref> which aims to capture both local and global structure.</p><p>We consider situations where instead of just one pairwise distance function, the input is a set of pairwise distance functions on the same set of objects. The optimization goal is to place the points in 3D so that the embedding simultaneously preserves the distances between the objects when projected to some planes. For example, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref> shows different views of a 3D visualization of a network dataset with multiple attributes. In this visualization, when viewing the 3D coordinates from the correct perspective, the apparent distance between nodes represents the true network distances for one of the attributes. See Section 4.4 for details about the dataset and the visualization.</p><p>For the case of graph visualisation, consider a set of vertices V (e.g., researchers in one university) and several relationships defined between them E1, E2, E3 (e.g. joint research publications, joint research proposals, membership in different departments). We would like to compute a layout L in 3D as well as 3 planes (P1, P2 and P3) such that when V is projected onto plane P1 we see the graph G = (V, E1) so that distances between vertices in the plane P1 correspond to the distances defined by E1. Similarly, when L is projected onto plane P2 we see the graph G = (V, E2) so that distances between vertices in the plane P2 correspond to the distances defined by E2, and the same for P3 and E3.</p><p>In both settings, this is a strict generalization of the classical MDS problem, which can be seen as a special case with only one pairwise distance function. Even for this special case this problem is known to be difficult as the standard optimization approaches such as gradient descent are not guaranteed to converge to the global optimum. Nevertheless, in practice, when there is a clear structure in the given graph, MDS is often likely to find a good local optimum and as we show in this paper, the simultaneous optimization of our Multi-Perspective, Simultaneous Embedding (MPSE) produces good solutions.</p><p>A common approach for visualizing different relationships on the same set of objects involves small multiples and often some mechanism (such as brushing and linking) to connect the same objects in the different views, or morphing from one view <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref>: 3D visualization of marriage and loan relations among prominent families in 15th-century Florence, viewed from different angles. Each node represents one of the families. An edge is drawn between two families if at least one corresponding relation existed between the families. The leftmost image shows the view that best captures pairwise distances of the marriage bonds between the families. The rightmost image shows the view that best captures pairwise distances of the loan bonds between the families. The middle two images show other views of the 3D visualization. The embedding is computed using MPSE with variable projections. A discussion about the quality of the embedding can be found in <ref type="bibr">Section 4.4.</ref> to the other. In contrast, MPSE produces one 3D layout and each of the different views is a 2D projection. In this way, MPSE attempts to balance the two main desirable qualities of good visualization of multiple relationships defined on the same set of data: the readability of each individual view (typically captured by a faithful embedding in 2D) and mental map preservation (typically captured by keeping the objects in the same position across different views). This cannot be accomplished effectively in 2D as there simply is not enough space to realize more than one relationship well, while it becomes plausible in 3D, as our experiments indicate. MPSE can also allow one embedding to tell multiple stories, depending on the different relationships in the data, captured by the corresponding projections, as shown in Figures 2, 9 and 10. Finally, MPSE can be used for reconstructing 3D structure from a collection of 2D images, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 1, 3 and 7</ref>.</p><p>With the advent of virtual reality and augmented reality systems, 3D visualization and 3D interaction with data in general and graphs in particular are becoming a reality. Still, when presenting 3D results in a paper we are limited to showing 2D snapshots. The MPSE webpage http://mpse.arl.arizona. edu provides 3D visualizations with interactive examples, and a functional MPSE prototype.</p><p>We describe the MPSE method in detail. We consider two different settings: one where the projection planes are given as part of the input (e.g., the three sides of a 3D cube) and the second where computing the projection planes is part of the optimization. Both settings have been implemented and work well in practice. A fully functional prototype is available on the webpage and source code is available on github. We provide a description on the python implementation and provide several examples of MPSE embeddings with real-world examples. Finally, we provide quantitative evaluation of the scalability of the two variants with increasing number of data points and increasing number of projections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Previous work</head><p>We review work on visualizing multivariate and multilayer networks, network layout algorithms, multidimensional scaling, simultaneous embedding, and 3D reconstruction algorithms. Multivariate network visualization. Multivariate <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[26]</ref> and multilayer <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[19]</ref> graph visualization has received a great deal of attention in the last couple of decades. Multi-label, multi-edge, multi-relational, multiplex, multi-modal and many other variants are cleverly encapsulated by the general multilayer network definition of Kivelä et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[27]</ref>.</p><p>Wattenberg's PivotGraph <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[50]</ref> system can visualize and analyze multivariate graphs not using a global graph layout but rather a grid-based approach focusing on different relationships between node attributes. Semantic substrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[46]</ref> unfold multiple attributes of a graph, a pair of attributes at a time, using two dimensions. Pretorius and van Wijk <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[42]</ref> describe an interactive system that relies on clustering of both nodes and edges and interactive exploration using brushing and linking (as well as parallel histograms) to show different graph attributes. GraphDice <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[7]</ref> is an interactive multivariate graph visualization system that allows the selection of attributes from an overview plot matrix. This results in a cross dimensional node-link plot for every combination of attributes arranged as a matrix. This system is built on the earlier ScatterDice system <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref>, which provides the ability to interactively explore multidimensional data using scatterplots. Transitions between the scatterplots with one common component are performed as animated rotations in 3D space.</p><p>Different from our approach, most of the earlier methods focus on interactive visualizations of multivariate graphs where changing queries result in changing layouts and views. The idea behind our MPSE approach is to produce one 3D layout of the input graph and several projection planes, such that each attribute corresponds to a projection plane in which geometric distances correspond to the graph distances specified by the particular attribute. The main advantage of this approach is that it helps preserve the viewer's 3D mental map, while also capturing different relationships in different projections of the same underlying layout. Network layout algorithms. Most basic network layouts are obtained using force-directed algorithms. Also known as spring embedders, such algorithms calculate the layout of the underlying graph using only information contained within the structure of the graph itself, rather than relying on domainspecific knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[28]</ref>. Visual analytics systems for graphs usually focus on interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[48]</ref>. MDS-like approaches to drawing graphs are exemplified in algorithms such as that of Kamada-Kawai <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[24]</ref> and Koren and Carmel <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[30]</ref>. Most commonly used graph drawing systems, such as Graphviz <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14]</ref>, Pajek <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[6]</ref>, Tulip <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[3]</ref> and Gephi <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[5]</ref>, provide options to visualize graphs in 3D based on MDS-like optimization. Variants of MDS are used in many graph layout systems, including <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">49]</ref>. Other approaches to exploring layouts in 3D include 3D hyperbolic and spherical spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">37]</ref>. None of these earlier approaches however, provides a way to simultaneously optimize different views for the same set of nodes. Simultaneous embedding. This problem is also related to simultaneous graph embedding and matched drawings of graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[8]</ref>. Specifically, in simultaneous geometric embedding of two or more planar graphs requires planar straight-line drawings of each of the graphs, such that common vertices have the same 2D coordinates in all drawings. This setting is very restrictive <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16]</ref> and solutions are guaranteed to exist for very restricted types of input graphs, such as two paths <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[10]</ref>, while instances with no solutions can be constructed from a pair of trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[18]</ref> or even (path, tree) pairs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Matched drawings require straight-line drawings of the two or more input graphs such that each common vertex has the same y-coordinate in all drawings. Pairs of trees and triples of cycles always have a matched drawing <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20]</ref>. In general, instances with no solution can be constructed from a pair of planar graphs, or even a (planar graph, tree) pair <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref>. Note that matched pairs of drawings can be obtained from the MPSE embedding for every pair of graphs using the intersection line between the corresponding pairs of projection planes as the shared y-coordinate in the pair of matched drawings. Multidimensional scaling. Consider the problem of recovering the positions (in R p for some integer p &gt; 0, typically p = 2) of a set of objects given their relative pairwise distances. That is, given n objects with indices 1, 2, . . . , n, and given pairwise distances </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">D = [Dij] n i,j=1 ,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">σ 2 (X; D) := i&gt;j (Dij − xi − xj ) 2 .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Minimizing the stress function (1) is typically accomplished using (stochastic) gradient descent <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[9]</ref> or stress majorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17]</ref>. Note that the original formulation of multidimensional scaling is non-metric MDS. The problem was first studied in the non-metric setting by Shepard <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[45]</ref> and Kruskal <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref>. Nonmetric MDS recovers structure from measures of similarity, based on the assumption of a reproducible ordering between the distances, rather than relying on the exact distances. Multi-view multidimensional scaling. Given a single pairwise distance or dissimilarity matrix D, MDS aims to find an embedding X that minimizes MDS stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. In some applications, data is collected from multiple sources, resulting in multiple dissimilarity matrices. The following question arises: Given K dissimilarity matrices D = {D 1 , D 2 , . . . , D K } of the same n objects, how to construct a single embedding X that best represents all of the dissimilarities simultaneously? The answer to this question depends heavily on how the different dissimilarity matrices are related to each other.</p><p>In the simplest of cases, the different dissimilarity matrices may correspond to different noisy measurements of the same pairwise relationship. In this case, it may be possible to estimate the true dissimilarity matrix D. For example, if noise in the observed dissimilarity matrices D k can be assumed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables, then the average (</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">D 1 + D 2 + • • •+D K )/K</formula><p>is an unbiased estimate of D. It would then be possible to construct an MDS embedding using the estimate of D. Another alternative is to construct an embedding directly, by finding an embedding X that best approximates all of the pairwise dissimilarities simultaneously, for example, by minimizing the functional</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">K k=1 σ 2 (X; D k ) = K k=1 i&gt;j D k ij − xi − xj 2 .</formula><p>Bai et. al <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[4]</ref> propose finding the embedding X that minimizes the Multi-View Multidimensional Scaling (MVMD) stress function</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">SMV (X, α; D) = K k=1 α γ k i&lt;j (D k ij − xi − xj ) 2 ,</formula><p>where the weights α = [α1, α1, . . . , αK ] are subject to the constraints</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">K k=1 αk = 1, 0 ≤ αk ≤ 1,</formula><p>and γ &gt; 1 is a fixed parameter. Here the objective is to find an embedding X that minimizes a weighted sum of the MDS stress (1) for the different dissimilarity matrices. The parameter γ balances between just finding the embedding that produces the smallest single stress σ 2 (X; D k ) and assigning equal weights to all of the individual stress values. This idea, along with similar multi-view generalizations of other visualization algorithms, are implemented by Kanaan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[25]</ref>. In these approaches, the general assumption is that the different dissimilarity matrices correspond to different views of the same relationship in the data. But what if the different dissimilarity matrices truly measure different relationships in the data? In this case, an embedding of the data whose corresponding pairwise distances try to agree with all of the pairwise dissimilarities is not useful. The multi-perspective simultaneous embedding problem that we propose to solve with MPSE is different, as we ask whether it is possible to embed the data so that different perspectives P k (X) of the embedding X can visualize the different dissimilarities D k simultaneously. 3D Reconstruction. Our problem is also related to 3D reconstruction from a collection of 2D images. This problem has been widely studied in different settings, including reconstructing the underlying real 3D structure from large collections of 2D photos <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[47]</ref>. More restricted variants are even closer to our setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">43]</ref>. Note however, that in our problem we have a constant number of inputs (distance matrices or graphs) and the projections we anticipate can be fixed or computed as a part of the optimization. Our proposed problem and its solution can be viewed also as a step of the structure-from-motion (SfM) problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[38]</ref>. The SfM problem is one of the central problems in computer vision which aims to recover the 3D structure of a scene from a set of its projected 2D images. We relate our problem to the SfM problem by assuming some fixed points in the 3D scene which can be estimated on the corresponding 2D projections via some feature extraction algorithm such as SIFT <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33]</ref>. Once these points are estimated, we can measure the pairwise distance matrices for these points and apply the MPSE algorithm to find the locations of these points in 3D.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Our Contribution</head><p>The main contribution in this paper is the introduction of the multi-perspective simultaneous embedding problem and a generalization of MDS to multiple distance matrices to solve it. This is at the core of the proposed MPSE method for visualizing the same dataset/graph in 3D from several different views, each of which captures a different set of distances/relationships. We consider two main variants: one in which each of the different distances/relationships is associated with a specific 2D projection plane, and the other where computing the projection planes is also part of the optimization. Extensive quantitative experiments show that the method scales well with increasing number of data points and increasing number of projections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Multi-Perspective, Simultaneous Embedding</head><p>Our proposed MPSE algorithm is a generalization of the standard (metric) MDS problem. The setting of MDS and its corresponding optimization function, which is called stress function is discussed in Section 1.1. We remark that if the minimum of the MDS stress function is zero, then the objects can be positioned in R p so that their pairwise distances exactly represent the pairwise dissimilarities of D. If the minimum of the MDS stress function is nonzero but not too large, the minimizer of the MDS stress function provides an approximate way to visualize the dissimilarities in R p .</p><p>Suppose now that instead of a single pairwise dissimilarity matrix D, we observe multiple pairwise dissimilarities matrices D = {D 1 , D 2 , . . . , D K } for the same set of n objects. It is natural to ask if MDS can be generalized to produce an embedding so that the dissimilarities D 1 , D 2 , . . . , D K can be visualized by the relative positions of the objects. If it is assumed that the dissimilarities in D are no more than approximations of some hidden true dissimilarity matrices D <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> true , D 2 true , . . . , D K true , then simple generalizations of MDS exist, as described in Section 1.1. In all of these generalizations, an embedding X is produced so that the distances xi − xj are as close as possible to all of the dissimilarity measurements</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">D 1 ij , D 2 ij , . . . , D K ij .</formula><p>Nonetheless, this is an undesirable assumption if the goal is to visualize multiple distinct relationships between the same objects. In particular, the dissimilarity measurements D <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> ij , D 2 ij , . . . , D K ij can be so different that no embedding X can produce pairwise distances xi − xj that help visualize all of these relations in a meaningful way.</p><p>Our generalization of MDS is inspired by the problem of 3D reconstruction from multiple 2D images. We first explain our motivation with an example based on a sculpture of James Hopkins, which illustrates how different the same object can look when observed from a different viewpoints. Depending on the direction from which the viewer sees the sculpture, the viewer will see a different digit '1' or '2' or '3'. For our experiments, we recreated the "1, 2, 3" sculpture and uniformly at random fixed a set of points in the three dimensions that produces the same visual effect when plotted. The set of points forms a figure '1' when viewed from the x-axis, it forms a figure '2' when viewed 60 degrees towards the y-axis, and finally as a figure '3' when viewed another 120 degrees towards the y-axis. Suppose now that the 3D structure is unknown, and the goal is to construct it using only the information from these 3 images. That is, we know the 3 distance matrices D 1 , D 2 , D 3 measuring the distances between the same set of keypoints in each of these images, and the goal is to find an embedding X so that</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">D k ij ≈ P k (xi) − P k (xj) , k = 1, 2, 3, i,j = 1, 2, . . . , n,</formula><p>where P 1 , P 2 , P 3 are the projections that map keypoints in 3D to their corresponding images. For this example one can take the following projection matrices:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">P 1 = 0 1 0 0 0 1 , P 2 = √ 3 2 1 2 0 0 0 1 , P 3 = √ 3 2 − 1 2 0 0 0 1 .</formula><p>(2) We can ask two questions: 1) given the dissimilarity matrices and the projections, can we recover the embedding X? 2) given the dissimilarity matrices, can we recover the projection matrices and the embedding X? Clearly the latter question is harder to answer. In both cases, we suggest a natural generalization of the MDS stress function</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">3 k=1 i&gt;j D k ij − P k (xi) − P k (xj) 2 .</formula><p>This can be naturally generalized to any number of distance (dissimilarity) matrices and projections. Even if the multiple dissimilarity measures at hand are not related to each other in such a geometric way, a similar idea may still provide a useful visualization of the multiple relations involved. Motivated by these examples, we generalize the MDS stress function in the following way: Given n objects with L distinct dissimilarity matrices D l , the multi-perspective MDS stress function is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">S(X, P; D) = L k=1 σ 2 (P (k) (X); D (k) ) = L k=1 i&gt;j D (k) ij − P (k) (xi) − P (k) (xj) 2 .</formula><p>(3)</p><p>Here, P = [P <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> , P <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> , . . . , P <ref type="bibr">(K)</ref> ], where P k : R p → R q are the mappings (projections).</p><p>We write P (k) (X) = [P (k) (x1), P (k) (x2, . . . , P (k) (xn)]. We mainly focus on the special case of linear orthogonal mappings, which correspond to orthogonal projections. There are two different ways in which the stress function (3) can be minimized: 1) Given a fixed set of mappings P l , we find a minimizer X ∈ R n×p ; 2) we find a pair (X, P) minimizing the stress, where X ∈ R p×n and the mappings P k for 1 ≤ k ≤ L are restricted to a class of functions (such as linear orthogonal transformations from R p to R q ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">MPSE with Fixed Perspectives</head><p>We first consider minimization of the multi-perspective MDS stress function (3) with respect to the embedding X only:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">minimize x i ∈R p S(X, P; D)<label>( 4 )</label></formula><p>In this setup, the perspective mappings P <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> , . . . , P <ref type="bibr">(K)</ref> : R p → R q are predetermined and fixed. We assume that these mappings are differentiable, so that a solution to (4) may be attainable using a gradient descent scheme. We remark that the objective function for MPSE with fixed projections in (4) is differentiable. Since the multi-perspectives MDS stress function (3) is generally non-convex, minimization to a global minimum is not guaranteed by a vanilla implementation of gradient descent. In addition, computing the full gradient of (3) at each iteration is expensive for large data sets and might make the algorithm infeasible. Thus coming up with a fast and accurate solution is one of the main contributions in this paper. In Section 3, we describe a stochastic gradient descent scheme with adaptive learning rate for efficient solution to this problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">MPSE with Varying Projections</head><p>We again consider minimization of the multi-perspective MDS stress function (3), but we no longer assume predetermined and fixed perspective mappings P. Our goal is then to find both the embedding X and the perspective mappings P that best capture the given distance matrices D. In order to do this, a suitable parametric family O of C 1 (R p , R q ) perspective mappings must be defined. The optimization problem becomes minimize</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">X∈R p×n , P (k) ∈O S(X, P; D)<label>( 5 )</label></formula><p>For ease of exposition, we only consider the set of orthogonal projections for the family of perspective mappings. Treatment of more general families of perspective functions can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21]</ref>. By O 3×2 we denote the family of orthogonal projections from R 3 to R 2 . Then, each perspective mapping can be parameterized by an orthogonal p × q matrix Q. The perspective mapping P (Q) is given by x → Qx. Note that the perspective mappings vary smoothly with respect to changes in the parameters, in the sense that the map Q → P (Q) (x) is C 1 for every x ∈ R p . The optimization problem (5) can then be rewritten as minimize</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">X∈R p×n , Q (k) ∈O 3×2 n k=1 σ 2 (Q (k) (X) ; D)<label>( 6 )</label></formula><p>We remark that the objective function of MPSE with varying projections in (6) is also differentiable. However, since the set O 3×2 of 3 by 2 orthogonal matrices is not a subspace of R 3×2 , minimizing (6) with respect to Ql cannot be accomplished via gradient descent. Instead, we make use of projected gradient descent, where Ql is updated by first moving towards the direction of steepest descent, and then projecting back onto the set O 3×2 . If A ∈ R 3×2 matrix, then the projection of A onto O 3×2 is the matrix Π(A) ∈ O 3×2 that minimizes A − Q F among all Q ∈ O 3×2 . There is a simple way to compute Π(A): if U ΣV T is the reduced singular value decomposition of A, then Π(A) = UV T .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Some Extensions</head><p>The MDS stress function can be extended to general graph structures. That is, we do not require that a pairwise dissimilarity relation exists between every pair of nodes. Moreover, we assume we are given a weighted pairwise relation, where some edges contribute to the stress function more than the others. To make stress values more meaningful, it is common to work with a normalized MDS stress function. The normalized MDS stress function is</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">σ 2 (X, D) = (i,j)∈E wij (Dij − (xi) − (xj) ) 2 (i,j)∈E wij(Dij) 2 .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where E is the set of edges in the graph for which a dissimilarity relation exits and wij is the weight corresponding to edge (i, j).</p><p>We also generalize MPSE to weighted graphs, where the normalized MPSE stress function becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">S 2 (X, P; D) = 1 K K k=1σ 2 (P (k) (X), D (k) ),<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where P (k) (X) = [P (k) (x1), P (k) (x2), . . . , P (k) (xN )] for each k = 1, 2, . . . , K.</p></div>

In our experiments, we found that convergence to a global minimum of (3) is unlikely using basic gradient descent algorithms. We found that a combination of smart initialization and stochastic gradient descent with adaptive learning rate usually produces better results than the vanilla version of the gradient descent. The benefits of using stochastic gradient are twofold: first, it is faster than the vanilla version of the gradient descent, and second, as observed by others <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[51]</ref>, it helps avoid local minima. Given a dissimilarity matrix D, let ξ ∼ Ξ(D, c) be a random variable returning a dissimilarity matrix ξ, where for each (i, j), 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n we include Dij with probability c and otherwise set ξij = 0. Let σ 2 (X, ξ) and ∇Xσ 2 (X, ξ) be unbiased estimates of the MDS stress and its gradient at X. Then, the multiperspective MDS stress (3) is approximated by where ξ = [ξ 1 , . . . , ξ K ] and ξ (k) ∼ Ξ(D (k) , c). The gradients ∇XS 2 ξ (X, P; D) and ∇ Q (k) S 2 ξ (X, P; D) are similarly computed.

We remark that the problem is non-convex and there is no guarantee for convergence. However, our extensive experiments show that with smart initialization, or with multiple runs of the algorithm (with different random initialization), the algorithm consistently finds good solutions. The idea behind the smart initialization is that even though the problem is non-convex, around the global optimum the problem is well-behaved and so starting close to the global optimum we can apply gradient descent. </p><formula xml:id="formula_17">Xt = Xt−1 −μX,0∇XS 2 ξ (X, Qt).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Clusters Dataset</head><p>One of the many applications of dimensionality reduction is to preprocess the dataset by reducing its dimension and then apply a clustering/classification algorithm. The setting where we want to test whether our proposed algorithm preserves the clusters of a given dataset is the following: We want to visualize a dataset in 3D such that different 2D projections capture different clusters (say, determined by considering different attributes of the data). For this purpose, we fix n = 200 and create 3 datasets in 2D each having 2 well separated clusters of 100 datapoints each. Our goal is to apply Algorithms 1 and 2 and check whether the corresponding 3D embeddings preserve the clusters and if so what the corresponding projections look like. We apply Algorithm 2 with T = 100, the distance matrices corresponding to datapoints of subfigures of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 8</ref> and random initialization. The results are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>.</p><p>Remarkably, as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>, the MPSE algorithm with varying projections captured the special structure of the dataset (three different pairs of clusters defined on the same datapoints) and embedded them in 3D so that the 3 different separations can be seen from the corresponding projections. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">15th-century Florentine Families Dataset</head><p>We now consider a network dataset that captures social relationships between prominent families in Renaissance Florence (one of the largest and richest cities in 15th century Europe) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">44]</ref>. This dataset contains descriptions of social ties between Florentine families during the years 1426-1434, a period of historical significance that marks the rise to power of the Medici family.</p><p>The social ties are divided into categories such as 'marriage' (number of marriages between two families) and 'loan' (number of loans between two families). We can interpret this dataset as a network with multiple attributes. To visualize this network, we select a subset of the families such that the network structure for the 'marriage' (1) and 'loan' (2) attributes each form a connected graph. For each type of relation k ∈ {1, 2}, we define the dissimilarity between two families as follows: for families i and j, if there is a nonzero number n <ref type="bibr">(k)</ref> ij of ties between the two families, then the pairwise dissimilarity is initially given by D</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">(k) ij = 1/n (k)</formula><p>ij ; afterwards, shortest path distances are computed for all pairs of families using this initial set of dissimilarities, resulting in dissimilarities for every pair of families.

We then compute a 3D simultaneous embedding based on both marriage and loan distances using MPSE with variable projections with the following parameters: maximum number of iterations T = 300, starting learning rate μ0 = 1, stochastic constant c = 0.1, and initial embedding from Algorithm 3.</p><p>The first row of images in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 10</ref> shows the two 2D MDS embeddings and the second row of images shows two projections of the 3D MPSE embedding. The first column corresponds to marriages and the second column corresponds to loans. The stress value for each embedding is the standard normalized MDS stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(7)</ref>. Hence, the MDS and MPSE values are directly comparable to each other. Note that the individual normalized  MDS stress for both perspectives in the MPSE embedding are close to the optimal normalized MDS stress values (computed individually for each attribute). This indicates that it is possible to visualize both attributes simultaneously with the MPSE method, without significantly increasing stress values.</p><p>The colors in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 10</ref> indicate the true graph distance from the Medici family, with respect to marriage relations (the first column) and loan relations (the second column). A "perfect" embedding would result in dark blue colors near the Medici family and yellow for the nodes farthest away (with gradual blue-to-yellow transition in between). Note that we can observe this phenomenon both in the individual MDS embeddings and in the MPSE embeddings in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 10</ref>. Different views of the 3D MPSE embedding are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref>, with the view corresponding to the optimal MPSE perspective of the marriage attribute on the left and the view corresponding to the optimal MPSE perspective of the loan attribute on the right.</p><p>A bit of historical background can help us see some interesting results in our visualizations. The Strozzi family had been Florence's richest one, but ended up exiled and in ruin after the Medici took control of Florence's government in 1434. The MPSE embedding, illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2 and Fig. 10</ref>, allows us a glimpse in this story. The Medici family occupies a central location in both the individual MDS and in the MPSE embeddings. The Strozzi family occupies a similarly central position in the marriage perspectives, but not in the loan perspectives. This reflects the nature of their political power at the time, as both families has strong ties to other prominent families in Florence, but the Medici family was doing better financially by that time. The better positioning of the Medici family is nicely illustrated in the MPSE 3D embedding in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref> in a way that cannot be illustrated by the MDS embeddings: the Medici family has a central position in the 3D embedding (with an average pairwise distance of 2.87), whereas the Strozzi family lies closer to the periphery (with an average pairwise distance of 4.05). Even though their position in the marriage network was firm, their position in the overall network was weaker.</p></div>

The dataset contains information about customers of a bank (gender, education level, income, etc.). We randomly selected 1000 customers and focused on three parameters: annual income, gender, and level of education. The goal is to use MPSE to embed the dataset in 3D so that three different projections show us patterns based on the corresponding parameters. Since MPSE requires numeric input we modify some of the parameters a bit. For gender we map male and female to 0 and 1. For education level, we map lower secondary, secondary, incomplete higher and higher education to 0, 1, 2, 3. To avoid giving more importance to some of the features, each set of features is then normalized so that the scale of all MPSE perspectives is the same.</p><p>We compute an MPSE variable projections embedding (Algorithm 2), after initializing it with Algorithm 3, using the following parameters: maximum number of iterations T = 200, starting learning rate μ0 = 1, and stochastic constant c = 0.004. The results are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 9</ref>. The first subfigure shows one view of the resulting 3D embedding, and the remaining subfigures show the projections of the embedded dataset onto the gender, education level, and income views.</p><p>The 3D embedding seems to capture well the different perspectives, shown in the 3 different projections. The gender view shows clearly separated clusters of male (orange) and female (blue color) customers. The education view groups customers with similar education levels (see the groups of squares, circles, and triangles). The income view attempts to "sort" the customers by income (high on the top, low on the bottom in this figure), as captured in the change of color intensity from the top to the bottom. This view also shows us that education level and income are correlated (circles at the top), and that men have higher income than women (the orange clusters are higher than the blue clusters). Indeed the actual averages for male and female customers in this sample of size 1000 are $195000 and $152000, respectively.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>We described a generalization of MDS which can be used to simultaneously optimize multiple distance functions defined on the same set of objects. The result is an embedding in 3D space with a set of given or computed projections that show the different views. This approach has applications for visualizing abstract data and multivariate networks. It would be interesting to experiment and test whether MPSE can compete with current techniques for 3D reconstruction from 2D images. For example, one could combine the MPSE approach with a multiway matching algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">39]</ref> and a feature extraction algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33]</ref> to automatically detect points of interests in each image, match them, and place them in 3D to recover the 3D figure.
