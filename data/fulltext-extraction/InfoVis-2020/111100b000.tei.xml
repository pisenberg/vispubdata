			<abstract>
				<p>Visualization designs typically need to be evaluated with user studies, because their suitability for a particular task is hard to predict. What the field of visualization is currently lacking are theories and models that can be used to explain why certain designs work and others do not. This paper outlines a general framework for modeling visualization processes that can serve as the first step towards such a theory. It surveys related research in mathematical and computational psychology and argues for the use of dynamic Bayesian networks to describe these time-dependent, probabilistic processes. It is discussed how these models could be used to aid in design evaluation. The development of concrete models will be a long process. Thus, the paper outlines a research program sketching how to develop prototypes and their extensions from existing models, controlled experiments, and observational studies.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>"The design of information graphics remains a poorly understood, hit-or-miss process." -Wattenberg and Fisher <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[122]</ref> This characterization remains accurate even in the larger context of designing interactive visualization systems.</p><p>But why is designing such systems so difficult? Designing can be viewed as a problem solving activity: find a solution to a set of requirements in a space of possible designs. For Munzner <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>, designing is difficult because the design space is huge, with most designs being ineffective, i.e., not satisfying the requirements. Furthermore, research on new design problems tends to increase the design space (or rather our knowledge of it) and thereby reduce the fraction of solutions for previous design problems even more. But designing could be easy if reliable and efficient strategies to search the design space for solutions were known. Current practice in visualization is to use heuristics and follow guidelines to quickly prune the design space in search for viable candidates, which are then tried. But these strategies, even if informed by decades of research and design experts' intuitions, are not necessarily reliable. Following Tufte's <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref> guidelines to maximize the data-to-ink ratio leads to suboptimal results if taken literally <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, and to avoid "chart junk" is not always beneficial <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Usually, the heuristics and guidelines are only valid under certain conditions, but these conditions are largely unknown. Shneiderman's visual information-seeking mantra <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref> is not being followed in all contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">111]</ref>. When the design space grows, it is typically not assessed whether these heuristics still hold. When the designed product should serve multiple purposes or a general purpose, trade-offs have to be made, because guidelines can conflict. For example, 2D map projections of the world cannot preserve distances, angles, sizes, and shapes at the same time. Are there guidelines and heuristics on how to trade off guidelines and heuristics?</p><p>More fundamentally, assessing whether a given design is indeed effective requires validation procedures; one cannot "just see" from a design whether it meets the requirements. One strategy is to use heuristic evaluation, initially proposed by Nielsen <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref> as a method to assess the usability of a human-computer interface. Heuristic evaluation involves checking whether the interface follows or violates an itinerary of design recommendations and guidelines. Zuk et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[130]</ref> introduced the topic to information visualization and later work by other authors refined and extended it <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">106]</ref>. However, heuristic evaluation only assesses whether all relevant heuristics and guidelines were followed when choosing a design; they assess after designing what should have been considered while designing. Another strategy is to compute metrics on concrete applications of the design, where more information is present about the design problem, e.g., the concrete data set used with the visualization system. A huge number of metrics are surveyed by Behrisch et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Most metrics are specific to a class of designs and are thus not usable to evaluate design outside this class. Within the same class, different metrics can disagree about the optimal solution. As a cautionary tale, many aesthetic criteria proposed in graph drawing <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105]</ref> turned out to have little or no positive influence on relevant tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">87]</ref>.</p><p>Proper validation thus requires observational studies and controlled experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. These, however, are cost-intensive, both in terms of time and human labor, and require researchers to be well versed in experimental design for human-subject studies to ensure that results are valid. Most controlled experiments in visualization only assess time and error of simple perceptual tasks, and often it is unclear how performance of these tasks stands in relation to the product serving its purpose <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>. Usually, the presumed purpose of visual data analysis tools -generating insight and hypotheses or increasing the knowledge of the user -is not assessed experimentally, with few exceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">127]</ref>. Presumably, because effects of visualization system use on the user cannot be measured directly. Additionally, user studies usually do not address directly how to turn an ineffective design into an effective one, or whether there is a design at all that could meet the requirements.</p><p>What is missing is a general method that allows to accurately predict the effectiveness of designs and to play through what-if scenarios. Predicting the effectiveness has two components: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> characterizing under which conditions a design is considered to be effective and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> determining whether a given design meets these effectiveness criteria. The first component is already challenging, because it is usually difficult to put into words or even formally describe what the intended purpose of general visualization systems is <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[113]</ref>. The second component is challenging, because effectiveness criteria often refer to an intended change in users' cognitive state (e.g. knowledge) and there are currently no models for predicting how use of an visualization system affects the user's cognitive state (e.g. knowledge). MacEachren's excellent book "How Maps Work" characterized studying these effects as the scientific approach to design, because it allows to explain why some designs work and others do not <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. It can give a rich picture why designs fail; this can be used to learn how to fix them.</p><p>In this paper, I sketch a research program aiming at models that allow to predict how visualization system use affects users' cognitive state and what it takes to build these models. The first step in modeling is to pick the class of model. Thus, I first reflect on the components in need of modeling and on properties of these components which inform selection of a modeling paradigm (Sect. 3). I then briefly survey modeling paradigms that have been considered in the fields of mathematical and computational psychology and cognition, which are largely unknown to the field of visualization. I will argue that, of these modeling paradigms, dynamic Bayesian models seem best suited to modeling visualization processes (Sect. 4). The value of researching such models is then discussed via potential applications (Sect. 5), and a road map for the research program is outlined in Sect. 6. I discuss some objection and responses respond to them in Sect. <ref type="bibr">7.</ref> This paper focuses on predicting the effects of visualization system use on the user. One can use the predicted effects to articulate effectiveness conditions. As Mackinlay <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> puts it, without a empirically verified theory of human capabilities, one has to conjecture a theory of effectiveness, and a more sophisticated theory of effectiveness requires more sophisticated search algorithms for the design space. This paper does neither address generative models of the design space itself nor search strategies for this space. It focuses on automating the evaluation of designs, not automating the design process itself.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>The need for models of visualization processes was recognized early on by Robertson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref>. Work in this area was initially focused on models of data (describing how facts are represented), models of graphics <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and models for turning data into graphics <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">125]</ref>. There was a strong focus on technology enabling visualization, losing sight of users of this technology and their tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109]</ref>, let alone individual differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[129]</ref>. In particular, modeling human-computer interaction turned out to be difficult <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Pohl et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref> survey a number of approaches to conceptualize interaction in visual analytics, but conclude that these are either too abstract to be readily applicable or only consider a part of "the puzzle" of interaction and thus called for research that integrated these conceptualizations.</p><p>Wijk's abstract model of visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[113]</ref> is interesting in that it conceptualized visualization as a dynamical system linking data and knowledge. This model was extended by Green et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> to include interaction among perception and cognition. Both models do not allow to actually predict how the user's knowledge will be affected, but this paper can be seen as making progress on Green et al.'s proposal towards a predictive model of human cognition. Models in visual analytics also emphasize the interplay of human and computer for knowledge extraction, discovery, and sensemaking, notably the work by Pirolli and Card <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref> and Sacha et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref>. Both focus on activities jointly performed by human and computer, indicating leverage points in the design to improve potential use cases, but not predicting its actual use.</p><p>But is a predictive model of the effects of visualization system use on the user feasible? Work in human-computer interaction and cognitive science indicates that it is. An early instance is the work by Card, Moran, and Newell, summarized in their book on the psychology of human-computer interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. In this book, they presented models for humans using word processing software and were able to predict accurately how long they would need for a range of benchmark editing tasks with different software products. Their work has influenced other cognitive architectures that allow to describe a broad range of human behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69]</ref>. It remains an attractive approach in human-computer interaction as a design aid and proxy to evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">91,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">123]</ref>. A landmark development was information foraging theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>, which was implemented in a cognitive architecture and gave accurate predictions of information seeking behavior. Beyond these applications in HCI, computational models of cognition have been fruitfully employed as cognitive tutors <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>: educational programs that not only have a representation of the subject matter to teach, but also a model of individual students. This model allows the tutor to tailor lessons and tests for individual students, while spotting mistakes and reasoning on their likely causes such as misconceptions, which feeds back to the tailoring of lessons. These models, however, do not address visualization systems.</p><p>There is also some work on modeling graph comprehension (see Hegarty <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> and the references therein). An early example is Lohse <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> who modeled eye fixations for a read-and-compare-twovalues task for three different visual representations. His model predicted duration of these tasks and was able to account for 56% of the observed variation. An inspiration for our work was a model of graph comprehension for 2x2 interaction graphs by Peebles <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80]</ref>. All these models differ from the proposed modeling approach, in that they are not general. They focus on single visual representations and do not address interaction. Also these systems often characterize ideal rather than real user behavior, e.g., Lohse's system assumes that eye fixations happens independently of the saliency of graphical elements and that eye fixations follow a "logical path" over the items necessary to perform the task. These systems typically fail to model and capture errors and other variation due to factors not explicitly accounted for.</p><p>Within the field of visualization, some work addresses perceptual optimization. Van Wijk <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref> suggested that visualization systems should include a mathematical model of the user's perception of images, which is then used to optimize the visual presentation. Van Wijk and Nuij <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114]</ref> used this to optimally zoom and pan in images. Wattenberg and Fisher <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[122]</ref> used scale-space methods to estimate how humans perceive the organization of visual representations as Gestalts and how to use this information to improve the visual design. Jänicke and Chen <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> presented a saliency-based metric for visualization that can indicate regions of an image that are over-or underrepresented relative to the designer's intent. Pineo and Ware <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref> presented a computational model for the early stages of the visual cortex and used it to derive perceptually tuned depictions of flow fields. Mittelstädt et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> used models of color contrast to generate color maps that reduce the error when reading off values. Zhou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[128]</ref> extend the model for viewing distance. Micallef et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> used a range of image and structural quality measures for tuning the accuracy of different reading and estimation tasks on scatter plots. While these works address perceptual properties, they neither address cognitive processes nor interaction and how reasoning is influenced. They are often tied to a particular visual representation and are thus not general. While perceptual processes and the general cognitive architecture varies little among individual users <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[121]</ref>, metrics that do not consider individual differences, such as whether users know how to work with the design, are thus blind to them. Instead, this paper suggest that models allow to describe and work with these differences as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">MODEL REQUIREMENTS</head><p>In this section, I will reflect both on what constitutes visualization processes and some of their fundamental properties in order to select a modeling paradigm in the next section. Note that the aim is for a modeling paradigm general enough cover all instances of visualization processes involving one human and one computer. Not all visualization processes have all properties and need to address all constituents (especially requirements 4 and 6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirement 1:</head><p>The modeling paradigm should be able to model both human and computer.</p><p>To quote McCormick, DeFanti, and Brown <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> in their characterization of visualization:</p><p>Visualization embraces both image understanding and image synthesis. <ref type="bibr">[...]</ref> It studies those mechanisms in humans and computers which allow them in concert to perceive, use and communicate visual information.</p><p>Note that this characterization gives equal weight to human and computer. Many models of visualization processes either focus on the computational part alone, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">125]</ref>, or present a black-box view of the human with unspecified behavior, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">118]</ref>. In visual analytics, conceptual models treat the computer and the human as equals, e.g., Sacha et al.'s knowledge generation model <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref>, or characterize visual analytics processes as mixed-initiative <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirement 2:</head><p>The modeling paradigm should be able to capture the dynamic mutual influence that constitutes human-computer interaction.</p><p>Some conceptualizations treat visualization as a predominantly feedforward process, i.e., activity of the computer is followed by activity of the human (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>). But this is neglecting the important contribution of human-computer interaction and the building of knowledge over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">113]</ref>. In contrast, visual analysis is a complex adaptive process <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Processes within the human are not feed-forward either. The view that perception and cognition are strictly sequential, bottom-up, stimulus-driven processes has been criticized by Patterson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>. Phenomena like Rubin's vase <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[121]</ref> demonstrate that perception is an active inferential process that generates an interpretation of what is seen merely mediated by the senses; the interpretation can flip without change in stimulus. Furthermore, reflection and deliberation are processes in the mind can proceed without external stimulus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirement 3:</head><p>The modeling paradigm should explicitly address the user's cognitive state in terms of knowledge change, decision making, and problem solving.</p><p>The most conservative conceptualization of the word "cognition" is that cognition mediates between perception and action. Since interaction with a computer constitutes action, it follows that in order to model interaction, one needs to model at least some cognitive processes. Deciding on an action depends on the user's knowledge and problem solving involves sequences of decisions on actions that move the current state towards the desired goal. Knowledge also plays a prominent role in certain models, e.g., van Wijk <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[113]</ref>, Green et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, and Sacha et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref>. Decision making plays a role in the cost-benefit ratio of Chen and Golan <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Problem solving is underlying the analysis of how tasks of different levels are related <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> and the anthropology-inspired multidimensional in-depth long-term case studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[101]</ref>.</p><p>This question ties in with a fundamental question regarding the purpose of visualization. Canonical uses are typically separated into visual thinking (hypothesis generation and confirmation), visual information retrieval (finding relevant data items), and visual communication (disseminating and justifying knowledge). All of these involve, to some degree, changes in knowledge, problem solving, or decision making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirement 4:</head><p>The modeling paradigm should be able to integrate data-generating processes as well.</p><p>McCormick, DeFanti, and Brown <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> viewed visualization as a means to inspect and manipulate the simulations (the data generating processes) while they are running to gain insight about the simulated phenomena. As Pike et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref> puts it, users do not interact with the data, they interact with the information space. Almost all conceptualizations of visualization processes start with the data, but data are merely a medium for coding facts -not always faithful mirror of the facts. Data may be afflicted by systematic or random errors due to the way they were generated. Data might be fabricated. As Wickham et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[124]</ref> points out, not all visible patterns indicate a true regularity in the process generating the data; they may have arisen by chance. Learning more about the data in these cases does not increase knowledge of the facts. In machine learning, adapting too much to the random errors (due to the data being a random sample from a distribution) amounts to overfitting. In order to reliably increase knowledge, errors should be removed, reduced, or their presence indicated. Inferential statistics explicitly models data generation and statistical methods then produce statements about properties of the data generating process to which one can attach a measure of confidence that is backed by probability theory. This explicit modeling of data generation and the use of probability theory to prove the validity of statements is presumably the reason why inferential statistics is preferred over visualization for confirming hypotheses. Modeling properties of the data-generating process and how visualization system use changes the knowledge about them could improve our ability to use visualization for purposes of confirmation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirement 5:</head><p>The modeling paradigm should allow descriptions of time-dependent processes.</p><p>Visualization processes are time-dependent. Input data can be just a file or streaming <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, i.e., there is continuous input to the visualization system, e.g., when showing fluctuating stock prices in financial markets or in instances of computational steering <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref>, where the user can manipulate the parameters of a simulation while it is running and being visually represented. But even if data are not streaming, image generation can be time-dependent, such as trivially in animation, interaction, but also incremental visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref>. Even static images require some time to read; a user can read off little information if the image is presented only for a few milliseconds. The users gaze will change during visual search <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Reflecting on and synthesizing information takes time, too, as does executing interactive gestures. Van Wijk's conceptual model <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[113]</ref> of visualization emphasizes this time-dependence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirement 6:</head><p>The modeling paradigm should allow description of probabilistic effects.</p><p>Visualization processes can be probabilistic (cf. Chen and Jänicke <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>). Data may reflect the real world subject to measurement error, which can be modeled using various measures of uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. Simulation errors can propagate. Image synthesis can be driven by a probabilistic algorithms, such as force-directed layout using random initial positions <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, jittering in statistical graphics <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, glyph placement strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[120]</ref>, or stochastic textures for spot noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[115]</ref>. Random sampling is a simple strategy to remove clutter <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. On the human side, random walk models are successful in explaining time and error rates in perceptual decision tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref>. For the same visual stimuli, eye movements can be very different <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Motor movements are probabilistic, influencing accuracy of mouse and touch gestures.</p><p>Even if computer and human behavior were deterministic, a probabilistic characterization can be usefully employed to describe our imperfect knowledge of not directly observable constructs such as user intent or contents of working memory and long-term memory: Using random variables and linking them to observable features allows to infer distributions for their values. When moving from single instances of visualization problems, random variables are also helpful. We might not know, with what particular data sets, tasks, and abilities a user will use a visualization system, but could model their probability distributions based on surveys of the target user group and setting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirement 7:</head><p>The modeling paradigm should be computational or allow simulation. Donald Norman once explained why judging the quality of a design is hard <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>: In addition to a model of the inner workings of the designed product, designers also need a model of how the prospective user will use it. Since designers are very familiar with the inner working of the artifacts they design, they regularly overestimate users' knowledge on how to interact with the product. Norman assembles many examples where failure to address this issue lead to unusable everyday things <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>. Cairo <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> recently discussed that these failures can also be observed regularly with graphics made by scientists for the general public. Arguably, modeling door handles is much easier than modeling tools for knowledge workers. For these tools, designers must imagine the system's users and how they reason with it. Since many of the perceptual and cognitive processes involved when using visualization systems happen automatic and non-consciously, novice designers are not aware of them. Therefore it is frequently recommended to learn about these processes and used them in design <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">121]</ref>. But knowledge of perceptual and cognitive processes often is not acted upon <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76]</ref>. After the characterization from the previous requirements it should become clear why: Imagining the consequences of the dynamic processes that is human-computer interaction seems impossible given the cognitive capacities of human designers and their imagination. Can a person with unimpaired color vision imagine how a graphic will look to a person with color impairment? Can designers imagine the change in knowledge of a domain expert that has more domain knowledge to begin with? The designer's imagination needs to be augmented by tools, therefore model predictions should be supported by a computer.</p><p>In summary, the modeling paradigm we seek needs to be able to describe time-dependent, probabilistic, mutually influencing processes within computers and users. These processes relate their cognitive state to properties of the data-generating process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">MODELING VISUALIZATION PROCESSES</head><p>A modeling paradigm that is general enough to work with both existing and future designs should focus on the part that is common on all these model instances -the human -yet be general enough to describe any visualization technique. Therefore, I will focus on models of human cognition here, which are not well known in the visualization community, and discuss how well they support modeling the computer part as well. A further criterion will be, whether these models could in principle be learned from data arising in empirical studies in visualization.</p><p>A vast number of mathematical and computational models have been proposed for psychological and cognitive phenomena, usually with the aim of explaining these phenomena <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">102]</ref>. The models fall into several modeling paradigms, which will be surveyed and examined with respect to how well they meet the requirements of the previous section. Dynamic Bayesian networks are proposed as a modeling paradigm well suited to modeling visualization processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Mathematical and Computational Models for Psychology and Cognition</head><p>Models for psychology have been developed since the 1970's alongside behavioral models in order to better understand the underlying processes in the brain and mind. Much of the development took place both in psychology and artificial intelligence, which is why some of the models might sound familiar to readers familiar with AI and machine learning. Unfortunately, not every model was developed with the aim of being an accurate model of human cognition; many were artificial agents for solving tasks that would require intelligence in a human and are not fully behaviorally equivalent. Surveys on mathematical modeling of psychology are given in a number of handbooks on the topic <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">99,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">102]</ref>. I will very briefly go over the different modeling paradigms: cognitive architectures, declarative/logical models, connectionist networks, dynamical models, and probabilistic models, and discuss each paradigm's suitability for purposes of modeling visualization processes. The distinctions between paradigms are not clear-cut, e.g., cognitive architectures can be connectionist or hybrids such as CLARION <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[103]</ref> rather than rule-based, and rule-based versions can also be the basis of declarative/logical models. It has been recognized that these modeling paradigms each have their advantages and disadvantages, and that hybrid models might be fruitful <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref>. Rule-based cognitive architectures <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[104,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">107]</ref> were already mentioned in Sect. 2. These are software systems and rule-based programming languages which describe human behavior as information processing models involving goal-driven problem solving and learning. Even though they seem far removed from the brain's neural activity, they were very successful in reproducing behavioral data. Their rulebased system allows them to easily incorporate visual designs that can be expressed as mappings from data attributes to visual attributes and event-based interactive gestures. The are usually deterministic, although some allow to assign probabilities to rules. One architecture, the ACT-R system <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, has seen many useful applications, such as models of information foraging theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>, graph comprehension of interaction graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>, and cognitive tutors <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The Web-page for ACT-R <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> lists hundreds of research papers on models for perception, attention, problem solving, decision making, learning, and memory. Unfortunately, being rule-based makes it difficult to integrate visualizations that cannot be expressed as simple if-then rules, such as probabilistic algorithms, or where doing so would cause a huge run-time, e.g. many of the graph drawing algorithms that employ combinatorial optimization. Developing the rules also takes a lot of time. It was estimated that for one hour of material in a cognitive tutor, 300 hours of programming are necessary on average <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. Learning in cognitive architectures foremost means the discovery of heuristics for problem solving; they cannot be used to learn directly from observed behavioral data.</p><p>Declarative/logical models <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> were inspired by formal languages and logic as a model for human reasoning. They employ knowledge representation and inference and are motivated top-down from the question: Which knowledge does a person need to solve a particular problem? Being developed more from the artificial intelligence community, they do not focus on modeling how humans actually reason, and have struggled to accurately model comprehension of certain linguistic structures such as indicative conditionals and non-rational reasoning. This modeling paradigm will not be suitable for our purposes, because only the simplest visualizations can be expressed in them, they intentionally do not address perceptual and lower-level cognitive processes or memory, and are neither probabilistic nor time-dependent.</p><p>Connectionist models <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref> use artificial neural networks to model human cognition. They were inspired by early neurobiological models of the brain. They have been successful in modeling perception, pattern recognition, as well as word-concept association. Concerning modeling higher-level cognition such as problem solving, they have not been as successful. Recurrent models do not seem to have been used much for modeling cognition, and currently no predictions of task completion times are made by these models. Artificial neural networks facilitate learning from observational data, and this has been used to model phenomena in developmental psychology. It should also be noted that even the community has some reservations: although this modeling paradigm was inspired by human neurobiology, success in modeling may simply arise from the well-known property that neural networks are universal function approximators <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref>. Thus, modeling cognitive processes still requires picking the correct structure. They are also opaque models, making them ill-suited as tools to explain and understand human cognition. Recently, Haehn et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> studied different classes of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and compared their performance to human performance in the accuracy of graphical perception tasks. Accuracy depended much on tasks and network type. The authors conclude that CNNs are currently not good models of human graphical perception. Even so, Giovannangeli et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> propose to use CNNs as an evaluation strategy for visualization systems.</p><p>They speculate that what is more difficult for a neural network will also be more difficult for a human, but admit that this is just a working hypothesis and would need to be proved, since network performance largely depends on network structure. It would be tedious to describe the computational part of a visualization system as a neural network.</p><p>Dynamical Models <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref> are favored by the embodied and situated cognition movement. They are motivated from the observation that human movement is smooth -something that can only with great effort be described in rule-based symbolic systems. Inspired by the success of modeling self-regulating systems via dynamical systems, i.e., systems of partial differential equations, this paradigm is adopted to describe cognitive processes such as sensory-motor control processes. Dynamical systems have also been used to describe activation in spatial memory and used to explain a phenomenon in child development. Schoner <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref> admits that these dynamical models currently only serve to indicate how some mechanism within the mind might work, and yield only qualitative, not quantitative predictions. Dynamical systems might seem attractive, since van Wijk's model of visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[113]</ref> is also expressed as a dynamical system, but it is left open how the equations in question look like. Dynamical systems are naturally time-dependent, but using them to describe probabilistic phenomena is tedious. Describing the time-discrete nature of a computer with a dynamical model seems a bit too much, but high-level aspects of the system could be approximated. Linear dynamical systems can also be learned from observational data, but it is unclear whether visualization processes can be described as a linear dynamical system.</p><p>Bayesian models of cognition are motivated by the observation that humans can perform inference under uncertainty, and quite frequently do so <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Much of the focus in this modeling paradigm is on modeling such inferences as Bayesian inference, but within this paper I would like to take a broader view. Bayesian models, like dynamical systems, allow to express general relationships and dependencies between variables. They are general enough that they are deemed a good fit not only as a unified model of cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref> but also neurobiological models <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>  <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. Simple example of a Bayesian network on four variables.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">X 4 X 3 X 2 X 1</formula><p>and are coherent with the hypothesis that the brain is essentially an inference and prediction machine <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. But even beyond these claims, Bayesian models are incredibly useful modeling tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. Not only can they be used to infer the values of unobserved variables from observed variables, there are time-dependent interpretations. The models can be learned and simulated using Expectation Maximization, Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo methods, and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Nested models afford describing variables at different levels of granularity: Variables can be subdivided into networks of further variables. Hierarchical models turn model parameters into model variables and makes learning these parameters an inference task, which is conceptually simpler. Under certain conditions, the links between variables can be interpreted to represent causal relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>, giving modelers a tool to directly translate conceptual models of interacting processes into a structure among the variables describing these processes' states.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Bayesian Networks</head><p>Bayesian networks are one type of probabilistic graphical model <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. They can be viewed as a data structure for efficient storage of joint probability density functions and typical operations on these, such as computing marginals and judging independence of random variables. The idea is simple: Any set of random variables can be enumerated, e.g. X 1 , X 2 , X 3 , X 4 , and their joint probability distribution can be written as a product of conditional probability distributions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P(X 1 , X 2 , X 3 , X 4 ) = P(X 1 |X 2 , X 3 , X 4 )P(X 2 |X 3 , X 4 )P(X 3 |X 4 )P(X 4 ).</formula><p>Variables often do not depend on all of their successors in the enumeration, therefore the formula might be simplified. For our example, let us assume the following is sufficient:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P(X 1 , X 2 , X 3 , X 4 ) = P(X 1 |X 2 , X 3 )P(X 2 )P(X 3 |X 4 )P(X 4 ).</formula><p>If the X i are discrete random variables, the decomposition of their joint probability distribution into conditional probability distributions is called a Bayesian network. Note that the same joint distribution can be described by different Bayesian networks. The structure of a Bayesian network can be drawn as a directed acyclic graph; every random variable is represented by a node and every dependency is turned into a directed edge. For our example, the result is given in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. Different orderings give a different structure and of particular interest are orderings where the number of dependencies becomes small. In practice, this happens when edges reflect direct causal influence, in which case Bayesian networks are also called causal graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>. Storing the joint probability density function can require a lot of memory, because of the combinatorial explosion of the random variables' value combinations. If all variables have only few dependencies, it is useful to store the conditional probability density functions instead.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Dynamic Bayesian Networks</head><p>Diagrams of Bayesian networks can also be interpreted temporally, in which case they are called dynamical Bayesian networks. A node in the diagram (e.g. X 1 ) then refers to a temporal sequence of random variables (X 0 1 , X 1 1 , . . . ) and directed edges connect to random variables of adjacent time steps. This means each node is associated with a conditional probability distribution of the form P(X n+1 i |X n j1 ,...,X n jk ), where X jl denote the predecessors according to the diagram. Since they are different variables, one can allow X n+1 i to depend on X n i and thus to have loops and directed cycles among nodes in the graph, since they do not produce directed cycles between the instances of the random variables they represent. If <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> would be interpreted like this, the conditional probability distributions for X 1 would be described as P</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(X n+1 1 |X n 1 , X n 2 , X n 3 )</formula><p>, for n ≥ 0. P(X 0 1 ,...,X 0 4 ) would describe the initial distribution of the state of the system and the conditional probabilities its time-dependent evolution. The conditional probability distributions are time-invariant when for all time-steps n ≥ 0, P(X n+1 i |X n j1 ,...,X n jk ) = P(X n+2 i |X n+1 j1 ,...,X n+1 jk ) -a typical assumption when the probabilities describe causal regularities (causal regularities are time-independent).</p><p>Dynamic Bayesian networks describe Markov chains. A Markov chain is a stochastic model describing sequences of states with state transition probabilities only depending on a finite number of previous states. The set of states is finite or enumerable. One can turn a dynamic Bayesian network into a Markov chain as follows: The set of states is given by the Cartesian product of the sample space of each variable in the network and the transition probabilities are given by the joint probability distribution function. For the dynamic Bayesian networks described above, to determine the probability of the next state it suffices to know the current state. For real systems, this construction will be practically infeasible, because the set of states is huge, but this shows why dynamic Bayesian networks are incredibly useful for describing Markov processes: they allow to describe combinatorial state spaces compactly. This link to Markov chains is fruitful, because it allows to reuse knowledge about Markov chains to study theoretical properties of the modeling paradigm.</p><p>From the theory of computation it follows that every deterministic computational process can be described by a deterministic machine having some configuration (usually machine state and input that is yet to be processed) and deterministic rules that describe transitions between configurations. If one treats configurations as Markov states and relaxes the deterministic transition rules to probabilistic transition rules, it becomes clear that deterministic computational processes are special cases of Markov chains: they consider only the previous state and each state has only one successor state with probability 1. Since every Markov chain can be described by a dynamic Bayesian network (on one variable), it follows that every deterministic computational process can be described via a dynamic Bayesian network. The machine part of a visualization processes is computational, therefore it can be described by dynamic Bayesian networks. But more importantly, rulebased cognitive architectures such as ACT-R and declarative/logical based systems describe computational processes. Recall that ACT-R has hundreds of papers on modeling perception, attention, decision making, problem solving, memory, and learning. Therefore one can conclude that dynamic Bayesian networks are in principle capable of describing both processes taking place in the computer and the human during human-computer interaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Why prefer Bayesian Networks?</head><p>The generality of dynamic Bayesian networks only shows that we do not lose modeling expressiveness when picking them over the more established rule-based cognitive architectures. The question remains whether we should prefer them. Model class choice usually trades off accuracy, efficiency, and complexity of description. As can be seen from the construction above, dynamic Bayesian networks will have a higher descriptive complexity for deterministic processes. But deterministic systems typically suffer from adequately modeling errors humans make and only describe ideal or average user behavior. To model real users or capture the variation of individual differences deterministic systems must explicitly model the causes of this variation. But probabilistic models allow to describe variation of factors that are not explicitly modeled. Therefore probabilistic models have an edge when modeling not single instances, but populations and distributions (over data sets, tasks, and user abilities), since one model suffices.</p><p>Another advantage is that Bayesian networks can be learned from data. However, the learning of Bayesian networks is quite unlike the learning in recommender systems for visualization design <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>   <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. A possible dynamic Bayesian network describing causal influences in visualization processes. A process taking place in the world produces data. This can be measurement, a simulation, or recording a set of facts. Graphics are generated from the data mediated by some parameters describing the current state of the visualization system (e.g. transformation parameters, current zoom and pan, filter settings, mouse cursor position). Parameters were initialized by properties of the data. An image is generated from the graphics mediated by display parameters such as display resolution. Image and current eye fixation update the current visual field. Automatic pattern detection on the visual field activates knowledge structures, such as graph schemata and reading procedures from long-term into working memory. The locus of attention is both influenced by salient features in the visual field (exogenous attention) and the current goals (endogenous attention) and mediates which part of the visual field is encoded in working memory. Non-conscious processes activated in long-term memory (habits), as well as working memory and conscious goals can trigger decisions, which program the sensory-motor control that steers and monitors hand positions and eye fixations through proprioception. Hand positions influence input devices such as mouse or touch displays, which can change parameters in the visualization system. automated design <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>. The later learn which designs are preferred, but not the reasons why. As such they do defer the question of good design to the quality of the training data. If they are trained on poor data, say data that prefers an empty image for every design problem, they will faithfully reproduce these preferences in suggesting to use empty images for every design problem. In contrast, I suggest to learn the effects on the cognitive state of the user within dynamic Bayesian networks from a broader range of data (see Sect. 6). The textbook by Koller and Friedman <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> gives many algorithms for learning structure and probability distributions. For dynamic Bayesian networks learning is intractable in general, but there exist approximate strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Bayesian Networks and Bayesian Reasoning</head><p>The qualification "Bayesian" can mean one of three things: (a) the use of conditional probabilities, (b) the thesis that probabilities describe degrees of belief (subjectivist interpretation of probability), or (c) the normative statement that probabilistic inference should follow Bayes' law. Bayesian networks only require meaning (a) and that is why they are useful in so many contexts, not only when describing human reasoning. One must distinguish what is modeled with how it is modeled. I suggest to use Bayesian networks to describe our imperfect knowledge of what is going on when a user uses a visualization system (how it is modeled). Bayesian networks are neutral as to whether the user's knowledge is modeled by assigning degrees of belief to a set of propositions or that users reason according to Bayes' law (what is modeled), although Bayesian networks allow both. Subjectivist models of knowledge have been used in prior work on assessing the influence of visualization on Bayesian reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">127]</ref>. They model the user's knowledge as subjectivist and contrast human performance to inference according to the Bayesian ideal. Kim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> found that individuals do not seem to reason according to Bayes' law. <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> shows an example structure of a dynamic Bayesian network. It has been synthesized from a general book on cognitive psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and two prior works on cognitive models for visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77]</ref>. It may be incorrect, as conceptual models in cognitive psychology can change. The depiction serves as an illustration for how a model's structure might look like. Note that it does not name processes, but only the quantities they transform or operate on and which make up the state space of the Markov chain describing the system's evolution. In contrast to existing cognitive models, it includes the computer and the processes generating the data. The model's structure incorporates Patterson et al.'s thesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref> that perception is not a purely bottom-up processes, but is influenced by top-down processes as well. Admittedly, it presents an impoverished depiction of the actual data flow that might happen when data is transformed into a graphic. Since there are so many possible data flows, the actual data flow could be described using a more detailed network in place of the "Graphics" node by employing nested Bayesian networks.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">APPLICATIONS</head><p>Beyond the scientific value of researching dynamical Bayesian networks of visualization processes, these models have a number of applications that make them useful design and research aids.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">"Debugging"</head><p>We have long realized that determining the dynamic features of a program described by static code is hard and we have developed tools to study the execution of software step-wise. We are used to using software debuggers when tracking down flaws in the code of a visualization system. But we have not yet developed a similar tool to "debug" a design by studying the processes in the mind of the visualization user. Simulating these processes can indicate flaws in the design and make the designer aware of unwarranted assumptions. If a certain intended event does not take place, the designer can inspect the user's state of mind and study why preconditions for this event do not hold. E.g., an interactive gesture might not be used because there is no visual indication of its availability. A value might not be read off, because the user lacks the knowledge necessary for interpreting the graphic or just plainly that labels are not salient. But more importantly than assessing whether the design produced the intended effects is creating awareness of unanticipated undesired effects. Does the use of the visual and interactive design require too much working memory? Even if the simulation will not uncover all design flaws, it might identify some of them so that proper usability testing with humans can focus on the flaws the system cannot spot <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p><p>The technology for these simulators will have to be developed, as well as good interactive systems for it. Since the dynamic Bayesian network comprises many variables, all of which may change in each time step, there are many events in the simulation, few of which will be relevant. One needs to translate certain concepts from software debuggers to these human cognition simulators, e.g. watches for variables and breakpoints which trigger when variables take on specific values. Reporting the results from multiple simulation runs and simulations of populations, however, will require new visualization and data analysis techniques for studying the simulations' results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Education</head><p>Especially for visualization novices with little knowledge on perceptual and cognitive processes, the model can be used on hand-crafted examples to demonstrate certain effects. In particular, the system by Peebles <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref> was originally intended to teach students how to read a certain type of graph. But watching the system in action (I highly recommend watching the video <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>) creates a lasting impression of the many mostly non-conscious events taking place when reading a graph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Characterizing Effectiveness</head><p>Describing design requirements can be hard, especially when a formal description is needed. Often one cannot say what one intends but can recognize good and bad features after looking at the finished product. By simulating a model of previous designs or design prototypes in a new problem setting, one can observe the effects on the human user. One can then judge as to which effects are desired and undesired and then sharpen the description of the conditions under which a design counts as effective. The main benefit of a model that comprises the user's cognitive state is that it allows to express effectiveness criteria based on latent cognitive state such as change in knowledge.</p><p>If the purpose of the visualization system is visual communication, designers have particular messages they wish to convey. These messages comprise a certain number of declarative statements, and one can use the model to simulate the change in knowledge of the audience for a particular visual representation of this message. If the audience's confidence in the statement is increased on average (or confidence in its negation decreased), the visualization is successful, otherwise unsuccessful. A probabilistic model may assess the variation in addition to the average. If, for instance, confidence increases for some part of the audience but for the rest it decreases, the visual representation might be ambiguous and only reinforces preconceived notions. In instances of visual thinking, if one uses an interactive visualization system to learn about some aspect of the real world, a system is successful if confidence in the statements that are true increases and confidence in statements that are false decreases. Otherwise the system is misleading.</p><p>The predictions of the model could also serve to test for overconfidence, i.e. does the confidence in a statement change appropriately, given the quality of the data? When presented with the statement that out of a particular group of 10 people randomly selected from the population, 6 have a certain feature X, humans tend to be as confident in the statement "60% of the population have feature X" as if they had been told that 6000 out of 10000 randomly selected people have feature X, even though the former is much more affected by random variation than the latter <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. A visualization system should not produce overconfidence. If one does not yet know what facts about the world the data represent, one could use the system and look for statements in which confidence changes and check whether this is consistent for multiple simulation runs on random subsets of the data.</p><p>But not only change in knowledge, but also the time required can be an important effectiveness criterion. The simulation could end if the desired confidence levels for success and failure are passed the first time, wait until an equilibrium state is reached, or the user lost interest in the visualization (i.e. the goal to use it is removed from working memory). One could observe changes in confidence over time and how strongly knowledge changes. Most likely, there will be diminishing returns of using a visualization system for the same data set, i.e. the rate of knowledge change decreases over time. Optimally, this curve will follow a specific function overall that can be described by one characteristic parameter (a convergence rate) of the techniques used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Evaluation</head><p>Simulations of models could be used as a proxy for evaluation. In this case, the simulator is run for one design or a set of competing designs with a representative distribution over data sets, effectiveness criteria, and user abilities. The result will be a distribution of the changes in the user's knowledge and one can declare one design better than another for the distributions picked if effectiveness criteria are met more often. Different designs can then be compared based on their average performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Improving Design</head><p>Beyond evaluation, one can perform a sensitivity analysis of model parameters. For instance, by observing the sensitivity of the effectiveness criteria on the random variable describing the parameters for the generation of graphics, one can try to optimize the visualization by tuning these parameters. Note, however, that the relation of parameters and effectiveness might be highly non-linear, making optimization difficult.</p><p>An interesting benefit arises when the machine part of the model is general enough to support multiple visual and interactive designs and some variables in the model serve to select these designs. If a sufficiently general generator of designs is thus build into the model, and heuristics can be formalized so that for each design one can judge whether it is compatible with the heuristic or not, one can validate heuristics for certain effectiveness criteria. One can then determine whether designs in line with the heuristic produce on average better effectiveness scores than designs in violation. Performing sensitivity analysis of the variables describing the design on the effectiveness criteria indicates improvements to the design.</p><p>The separation of simulation time and real time allows to answer further what-if questions. For instance, if one hypothesizes the system not to work because an algorithm is too slow, one can tell the simulator that the algorithm is faster and look whether this solves the problem. If it does not, there is no use of actually developing a faster algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6">Aiding Exploration</head><p>Similar to cognitive tutors <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, the visualization system itself could include a model of the system users that it uses to simulate their cognitive state. It could infer users' goals from their gestures, monitor their progress, and adapt the design or recommend other views to nudge them in the direction of relevant information that they currently ignore.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">A ROAD MAP</head><p>The research involved in determining the best structure among random variables, their distributions, and other model parameters will likely take decades. Therefore it should be discussed how the model can be researched step by step and using division of labor. We should follow the advice by George Pólya <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref> and solve the simplest unsolved problem first. The causal model allows an isolated study of each random variable and its direct dependencies if they are observable. But our model includes variables within the human part that cannot be observed directly. Instead, we have to resort to studying the smallest part of the model that includes all direct influences and effects of the latent variables. With respect to the illustrative model in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>, this would mean the human part plus the stimulus image, eye fixation, and hand movement. This involves creating a small prototype, crafted for one simple visual design first, presumably one for which there is ample empirical data. Possible candidates are scatter plots, bar charts, and line charts, because of the many studies in psychology and visualization on how humans perform simple reading and estimation tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref>. Probability spaces of random variables of latent concepts would be defined on a basis of need rather than completeness. Developing probability spaces for the observable variables first and thinking about how they can be separated combinatorially can help gain familiarity with the process. The model could be extend to cover other visual designs, but it will be more productive to extend other aspects first: cognitive algorithms, perceptual patterns, knowledge models, and actual interaction. Extensions in different directions can be partially performed independently, and further research will address how to unify these extensions.</p><p>The prototype should incorporate hypothesized non-conscious cognitive algorithms for simple graph reading tasks addressing eye movements between marks, axes, axis ticks, labels, and legends as discussed in previous research on graph comprehension <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. The prototype should negotiate exogenous and endogenous attention models and link these with eye tracking studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, cognitive load with EEG <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>, and other measures of cognitive constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. A new experimental paradigm will be needed to validate these cognitive algorithms.</p><p>Knowledge that is used in visualization processes comes in different levels of granularity <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. In order to have a minimal working model of interpretation for the prototype, one should assume that the user already has the knowledge schema required for interpretation present while extensions should also allow to predict which knowledge schema is activated based on the visual input's gist, which is a kind of graphical pattern. Typical confusion that can arise in interpreting <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, e.g. mistaking a parallel coordinate plot for a line graph, can then be captured by the model. This part will tie in with assessments of visual literacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, which can be used to estimate the proportion of the population that have the necessary knowledge schema.</p><p>In concert, the knowledge schema and algorithms describe processes for reading off attributes of single graphical marks and turning them into propositions in working memory. This part of the model should reflect experimental data on cognitive biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">117]</ref>, in particular non-Bayesian belief update <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">127]</ref>. More complex cognitive algorithms reflecting conscious problem solving, could be extracted from studying think aloud protocols, interaction logs <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, and cognitive tasks analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>, but are added to the model at a later time. The plethora of task taxonomies (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> and the references therein) can help structure the modeling the space of user goals. Knowledge generation models <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">93]</ref> and relations between tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> determine possible and probable transitions between goals and tasks.</p><p>Prototypes can be extended in terms of visual patterns afforded by each type of visual representation and how such patterns are interpreted. For this we should develop systematic overviews of visual patterns in graphical displays in general and specific representations. We have to move beyond simple concepts, such as trends and clusters: graphtheoretic scagnostics <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[126]</ref> and other metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> can inspire this work.</p><p>Prototypes will consider still images only. If models can predict short-term effects very well, one can extend them to animations, which can be modeled as sequences of still images that effect the human mind only for a short duration. If long-term effects can be predicted reliably, interaction can be added. Also, research effort should focus first on single charts, and only later extended to composite visualization, such as small multiples, detail insets, and linked views. A further extensions is the inclusion of inference and reasoning taking place when visual information is integrated with background knowledge. Prototypes should only model how the working memory is affected, while assuming no influence on long-term memory. Later, this effect will be added, in part informed by studies such as by Borkin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>, but will require more research similar to memory and learning experiments in cognitive psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Domain-specific knowledge and how it changes with visualization use should be included last.</p><p>Another important point is researching the probability distribution of data sets and describing probabilistic data generation processes.</p><p>The models themselves can indicate fruitful directions of research. Sensitivity analysis of model parameters in the human part can indicate which parts of the model need adjustment to remove discrepancy with observed behavioral data. It can also be used to determine under which conditions the model currently produces predictions of low confidence, i.e., indicate which part of the model would improve the models' explanatory and predictive power best. Some research will be needed on the simulator, too. To address computational efficiency, clever engineering solutions and corner cutting will improve our capabilities to simulate large and more complicated problem settings. There is no need to simulate deterministic subprocesses as if they were probabilistic.</p><p>The discussion above points out a useful side-effect of this research program: It shows how much of the empirical research in visualization can be brought together under a common model. The reader can hopefully forgive that I did not survey exhaustively which results can be integrated with the model; the aim was merely to show the diversity of research that can inform the construction of models. A collection of studies and their translation to the model remains future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">DISCUSSION</head><p>One might still have reservations, whether the approach is feasible. If designers, well educated on perception and cognition, cannot simulate in their mind the user interacting with a system, maybe the design is flawed from the outset. This stance constrains the set of designs strongly and implies the hypothesis that there are no design solutions beyond what designers are able simulate in their mind. One might still see value in my suggestion, since the externalization of some of the simulation provides more capacity for other, more high-level aspects of the design. This, however, requires the models to be easy to use in order not to produce more cognitive load than they are supposed to reduce. We will most likely need visualization methods to study the data generated by the simulations.</p><p>One might have reservations on the choice of the modeling paradigm. After all, cognitive architectures such as ACT-R have such impressive track record in terms of successful models of human cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, they should not be dismissed so easily. Also, deep neural networks and recurrent networks look very promising for classification and pattern recognition. I gave good reasons to hold that dynamic Bayesian networks will serve well as a unified model, but this does not rule out hybrids. Intelligent agents that infer the intended message from grouped bar charts also use a combination of models <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Furthermore, researching models in cognitive architectures first may be more productive than directly researching dynamic Bayesian networks. The link of both with Markov chains allows to translate research results from cognitive architectures to dynamic Bayesian networks.</p><p>One might hold that the suggested approach will fail. That may be the case, but if the approach fails, it will fail for a reason. Understanding this reason can inspire the next round of modeling strategies. Learning from mistakes requires the courage not to avoid them.</p><p>Another general objection is that the human mind might be too complex to be fully modeled and simulated, and therefore any approach is doomed to fail. This might be the case, but note the similarity with weather and climate prediction. These have developed several strategies, such as ensemble simulations to assign probabilities or average the results to the most likely outcomes. Such strategies can be employed here, too. Instead of focusing on simulating one user, simulation of cohorts of users, preferably with individual differences could be used. When the model is used to guide the user though the exploration of data, the model could use the user's observable behavior, e.g. eye and mouse movements, to correct its conception of the current unobservable state of the user. Second, if the interaction between user and visualization system is viewed as a complex system, one should also note that the visualization system's behavior is under the control of the designer. Good designs might be characterized as those which do not produce chaotic or unstable behavior, which would indicate that the user draws unintended conclusions from using the system. Rather, good designs can be characterized as forming complex systems with users that have attractors for the intended or desired change in their knowledge.</p><p>Note that if crafting models and theories for predicting and explaining the effect of visualization systems on knowledge were impossible, we would be unable to justify the reliability of visualization. Research in science uses statistical tests to justify its knowledge claims much more frequently than visualization, since inferential statistics uses probability theory to derive and proof the suitability of these tests to justify statements with a quantifiable confidence. In part, the choice of probabilistic models was to have a unified mathematical model that, at least in principle, could be used to prove or compute expected values and their standard errors to allow something similar: to assign to each prediction about a knowledge change a value of confidence. If we are able to do this, visualization could be a competitor to inferential statistics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper proposed an argument for a concerted effort to build models of users interacting with interactive visualization systems and how this affects the users' cognitive state, such as knowledge, decisions, etc. I argued that the modeling paradigm should satisfy seven requirements derived from considering what constitute visualization processes and some of their fundamental properties. Multiple mathematical and computational modeling paradigms for psychology and cognition were examined based on whether they satisfy the requirements. Dynamic Bayesian networks were identified as a data structure with many favorable properties: they efficiently store joint probability distributions as products of conditional probabilities and can be interpreted as causal models. This allows it to easily translate conceptual models of processes influencing each other to mathematical models. Dynamic Bayesian networks can be used to simulate these processes and allow to infer and learn unobservable parts of the model. The value of researching these models was demonstrated by applications of these models as proxies to validating visualization designs and aides in the design and data exploration. A road map was proposed regarding the capabilities of first prototypes and directions of how to extend them. Although much of the empirical work can and should be integrated into the models, it will be fruitful to use experimental paradigms targeting model development.</p><p>Hopefully, some readers could be convinced that following this research program will have many benefits for our community, despite the enormous challenge it presents. For a complete modeling of the effects on users' reasoning, one could also consider their affective state as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[119]</ref>. Modeling surprise, enjoyment, and frustration seem important facets in predicting how long a user will use the system. One could also model the effects of stress that arises in managing the response to emergencies and catastrophes. But currently there do not seem to be many computational models for these factors, presumably because of few experimental results. Another area for future research are extensions of the model to multiple analysts and analysis tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>. This will require computational models of human verbal communication. Lastly, one can also consider the ethical implications of this research. A more accurate picture of how visualization systems influence the users' knowledge can be exploited to create deceiving visual representations. The use of knowledge generated through data analysis also can have ethical and political consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59]</ref>, especially if the data analyzed are representing social phenomena. For now, however, we should research solutions to the smallest unsolved problem first.</p></div>		</body>

Jens Kasten early on challenged me to go beyond just another conceptual model. The ideas were further influenced by discussions with a number of people over the years: Christoph Garth, Heike Leitte, Alexander Wiebel, Mario Hlawitschka, Hans-Christian Hege, and Gerik Schuermann. I also thank the anonymous reviewers for pointing out presentation issues. Resolving one of them made me think more deeply about using Markov chains to describe visualization processes.</p></div>
