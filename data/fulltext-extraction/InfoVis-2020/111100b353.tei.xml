				<p>Fig. 1: An example of SEQUENCE BRAIDING applied to blood glucose and meal data of a patient with type 1 diabetes. This temporal event sequence and attribute data is modeled using a layered directed acyclic network, where each node represents an individual event (meal) and contiguous edges connect the events from a single day in sequence. Nodes are aligned into columns based on their event (meal) type and into rows based on attribute values, in this case quantitative blood glucose groups. Nodes are also color-coded by attribute group: very high, high, normal, low, and very low.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Temporal event sequence data is common across many domains such as health care, activity tracking, sports analytics, cybersecurity incident analysis, and web analytics <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The gathering and analysis of this data is important to help users make sense of what has happened and to aid in future decision making. Analysts are often interested in whether there are general patterns and trends in the data. These patterns can be related to the sequence, such as the common precursor, co-occurring, and aftereffect events around an event of interest, but also the attributes associated with these events <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>For sequence analysis, sentinel event alignment has been used effectively for clearly showing patterns around one <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> or two <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> events of interest. However, overview tasks may require examining all possible alignments of interest. Existing alignment approaches require interaction and time or juxtaposing many separate aligned visualizations for the analysts to build such an overview.</p><p>Multiple coordinated visualizations help illustrate overviews of event attributes <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. However, it is challenging to examine the linkage between related data in juxtaposed views due to limited space for each individual visualization. Moreover, coordination in juxtaposed views requires substantial interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Existing approaches for combining event sequence and attribute visualization include separating event types for quantitative attribute groups (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref>) and using color to encode aggregated attributes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>). Yet, current approaches do not sufficiently support visualizing event sequence data and attributes together. Therefore, we need new holistic overviews that directly integrate attributes as a first-class citizen in sequence visualization. We aim to address these issues by aligning a large number of temporal events as well as aggregating attribute groups in a single overviewfirst visualization. The main contributions of this paper are:</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Motivating Case Study: Type 1 Diabetes</head><p>We introduce our visualization technique and algorithms in the context of a design case study on type 1 diabetes treatment.</p><p>Type 1 diabetes is an incurable autoimmune disease that affects the patients' ability to regulate their blood glucose levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. The only treatment is for patients or their caregiver(s) to take over the role of their body in monitoring their blood glucose and administering food and injecting insulin to shift their glucose levels up and down, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. Our discussion here of type 1 diabetes treatment is necessarily limited. For more information please see <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref>.</p><p>Blood glucose levels can be monitored by periodically testing blood with a glucose meter (SMBG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, e.g., daily before eating, or with a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), which provides frequent measurements on the order of every 5 minutes throughout the day <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Proper titration of the amount of insulin to administer for treatment and for food, e.g, at a meal, requires careful data analysis that can happen on a monthly or even weekly schedule. This titration can even be done independently by the patients themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref>. Regardless of who performs the analysis, it requires that the patient or their caregiver(s) have logged events such as food intake and insulin injection as well as attributes like blood glucose levels at those events. Analyses are generally limited to exploring the previous 14 days of data due to some combination of logging burden, and relevance to current care and can last 15-60 minutes in the clinical setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. However, research in diabetes treatment suggests that clinicians also need information over a longer duration (e.g., three-month clinical visit data) to evaluate how well patients control their diabetes condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. Current approaches do not sufficiently support examining event sequences within a long period of time. Our approach attempts to address this issue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.1">Type 1 Diabetes Data and Tools</head><p>For this study we use data from an anonymized single elementaryschool-aged child with type 1 diabetes which was collected by the patient and their caregivers over 877 days. It includes timestamped pre-meal blood glucose measurements (SMBG or CGM), the meal type, the grams of carbohydrates ingested with each meal, and the injected insulin amount in units (U-100, 1 unit= 0.01 mL). Blood glucose measurements are recorded using mg/dL in the USA, also used herein, with target values falling in 80-180 mg/dL. Excursions from this range can result in both imminent and long-term medical complications <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In the UK and many other countries, mmol/L is used with a target of 4.4-10 mmol/L. Roughly, mg/dL = 18× mmol/L. We contribute this data as part of our supplemental material at osf.io/mq2wt.</p><p>Software tools are available for visualizing diabetes data, e.g., using line charts and high-level aggregates such as time-in-range, but few provide effective multi-day event sequence and attribute overviews which are necessary for insulin titration <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> and none support simultaneous alignment of temporal events and attribute groups for overview analysis. For an overview of diabetes visualizations see Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.2">Type 1 Diabetes Case Study</head><p>A subset of this data is shown using SEQUENCE BRAIDING in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">fig. 1</ref>. Since the data is human-generated, the logs can have anomalies in them. While our system is resilient to anomalies, larger human introduced errors such as missing types or attributes are impossible to automatically handle and are therefore discarded. We group the records according to their blood glucose values into 5 predefined 1 visdunneright.github.io/sequence_braiding/docs/ ordinal groups -very high, high, normal, low, and very low. The logs are temporally folded by day <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Temporal Event Sequence Visualization</head><p>Much has been written on event sequence visualization given the widespread availability of data and variety of visual representations possible. There have been attempts at defining a design space for event sequences, e.g., Du et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and Tang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>.</p><p>As we have discussed, aligning temporal event sequences by sentinel events of interest can help display patterns of precursor, co-occurring, and aftereffect events <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Single-event alignment was pioneered by LifeLines2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> for clinical tasks and has been adopted in the design of, e.g., CareCruiser <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, LifeFlow <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>, EventFlow <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, and Peekquence <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Single-event alignment has since been applied to many diverse domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Recently, in IDMVis Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> extended this approach to support dual-event alignment and provide ways for scaling the intermediate timeline. The value of dual-event alignment for analyzing intermediate events was demonstrated in a controlled experiment by Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. These alignment approaches display either an exact or relative time delta around sentinel events.</p><p>In order to provide overviews of the entire set of sequences, several tools have used layered flow graph visualizations. LifeFlow <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> and EventFlow <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> have used hierarchical icicle plots to aggregate events at multiple layers out from the aligned sentinel event. BaobabView <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> used a comparable approach for visualizing decision trees. Escaping the limits imposed by a strict hierarchy, Outflow <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, Care Pathway Explorer <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, used node-link visualizations of directed acyclic graphs and combined events of a type at each layer, akin to interactive Sankey diagrams <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, TopicStream <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, or the adjacency matrix representation in MatrixWave <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>. However, there are limitations to layered flow graph approaches: (1) there exists a fan-out effect as the number of possible subsequences expands each layer from the alignment, (2) each layer can contain many different types of events making highlevel observation difficult, and (3) by necessity the time delta between events on subsequent layers is aggregated or omitted in static views. In SEQUENCE BRAIDING we address issues (1) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>, and retain <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</p><p>Like our work, egoSlider <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> and Set Streams <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> employ layered node-link graphs, with the objective of using graph topology to highlight patterns in the data. Both use fixed rank assignment by binning events by time period, while SEQUENCE BRAIDING uses an event alignment algorithm. Moreover, we improve upon the simplistic intersection reduction methods used. Interestingly, Hive Plots <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, pursues the same objective with a radial axis that represents a layer for each structurally-derived attribute of interest, with nodes positioned by the attribute value. This limited structural grouping can produce visual signatures to help make patterns stand out. These node-link visualizations share issues (2) and (3) with flow graphs, mentioned above.</p><p>Conversely, storyline visualizations such as described by Tanahashi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> and Tang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> are designed to represent the relational dynamics of individual entities, each represented by a line. While the overall goal is similar to ours, storylines make use of vertical position only for showing approximate groupings of entities at time points and not exact event or attribute alignment as is our goal with SEQUENCE BRAIDING. Likewise, it is possible to directly visualize multiple sequence alignment results as in Sequence Bundles <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, though it is not designed for showing attribute and event overviews.</p><p>As our domain case study is related to type 1 diabetes, we should point out the survey of electronic health record visualizations by Rind et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> and the five Ws for healthcare informatics visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. However, as SEQUENCE BRAIDING is a general-purpose event sequence and attribute visualization, we will not further detail less relevant domain visualizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">N-layer Intersection Reduction Approaches</head><p>The barycentric approach is a common heuristic-based method to reduce the number of intersections in a layered graph. The vertical positioning can be computed using either the mean <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> or the median <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> for the barycenter of incident nodes. The use of heuristics is common in solving the intersection reduction problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>. Gansner et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> use another heuristic approach using the median, and cite Warfield <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> as a base for their work. In SEQUENCE BRAIDING, we use Gansner et al. as a base, adding a multiple sequence alignment algorithm for the rank assignment step and grouping constraints. Another approach is based on calculating and drawing the maximum level planar subgraph and reinserting the nonplanar edges at the end -with the nonplanar edges being the ones that introduce crossings <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>.</p><p>Heuristic approaches do not guarantee an optimal solution. It is possible to formulate the problem as a linear programming problem to find an optimal solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62]</ref>. However, these methods are only suitable for small graphs. We discuss this further in our appendix at osf.io/mq2wt. N-layer intersection reduction techniques have been applied to a multitude of different contexts that required different constraints and have different objectives. Waddle <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> proposes the problem of displaying data structures on graphs with nodes that include ports. Metro map layout algorithms often include layered intersection reduction approaches aimed at better readability <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>. For a more complete survey, please see Tamassia's book on graph drawing <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">DESIGN REQUIREMENTS</head><p>We first developed requirements using Adrienko &amp; Adrienko's general task typology <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and a hierarchical task abstraction by Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>.</p><p>DR 1: Support many-event alignment -The visualization should support many-event alignment such that general patterns across event sequences can be clearly displayed in a single overview-first visualization. A single visualization avoids needing interaction and time or juxtaposing many aligned visualizations for creating a mental overview.  DR 4: Support arbitrary ordering, absence, and duplication of events -Human-generated data is messy and prone to errors. Our visualization must not make any assumption on the data and be robust with regards to arbitrary ordering, absence, and duplication of events.</p><p>DR 5: Specific sequences are uniquely identifiable -Within the overview, the reader can still identify specific sequences and all the events belonging to that sequence. DR 6: Support reasoning about an individual event type -The visualization should display the distribution of an attribute value, the frequency of the precursor, and aftereffect events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">SEQUENCE BRAIDING</head><p>SEQUENCE BRAIDING is a method to display multiple sequences of events with associated values, that aims to help the reader detect patterns and trends in the data. Multiple sequences spanning a time window are represented adjacent to each other, with each sequence being displayed as a line. Events which occurred throughout a sequence are represented by nodes placed on the line and aligned according to their type.</p><p>The ranks for each event type are computed before building the visualization via pairwise alignment. In accordance with DR 4, the use of an alignment algorithm allows our method to represent any types of event occurring in any order. In SEQUENCE BRAIDING, each event has a continuous attribute associated with it. The attribute values are grouped into ordinal groups based either on the data or to minimize edge crossings. We keep a consistent ordering of events according to their associated attribute across the ranks in order to make patterns and outliers emerge. The most apt ordering for the attribute should be used. This can be the numeric value of the attribute (e.g., blood glucose), or an arbitrary ordering (e.g., chess pieces). SEQUENCE BRAIDING is designed for non-cyclic sequences: if an event occurs twice in a sequence, the event will be repeated. This is necessary in order to represent sequences with repeating events (such as multiple snacks in a day) that do not imply a cycle. Cyclicity can be managed by folding <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> the sequences according to the qualities of a dataset and needs of the designer. In our diabetes case study, given the cyclic nature of daily behaviors we fold the sequences at each midnight. However, folding by week may also be appropriate.</p><p>One of the largest advantages that SEQUENCE BRAIDING offers over the other currently available methods is the ability to represent many sequences simultaneously in relatively little space, as in <ref type="figure">fig. 7</ref> with 200 sequences. Even with more sequences, the overview clearly shows the distribution of events in each attribute group for each event type, and by focusing on the groups it can be read like a bar chart.</p><p>We believe SEQUENCE BRAIDING can be generalized to many domains which have sequences with similar characteristics, discussed in section 8.3. Examples of other uses can be found in the appendix at osf.io/mq2wt.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Description of the Algorithm</head><p>SEQUENCE BRAIDING represents events as nodes in a graph. An edge represents a sequential relationship between two events. The algorithm has two key steps: rank assignment &amp; intersection reduction. Rank assignment is obtained through a pairwise alignment of the input sequences. Ordering within each rank is then done through a constrained intersection reduction algorithm based on the barycentric approach.</p><p>The objective of the rank assignment step is to find the shortest common supersequence of events that ensures they match across sequences. This supersequence allows us to keep events that are often subsequent close together, creating clusters of edges and high-level visual patterns. Likewise, anomalous infrequent events stand out from the rest. The intersection reduction step is then used to improve the readability and visibility of the high-level patterns. This step moves nodes within the prescribed constraints imposed by the rank assignment and their ordinal attribute value groups. The diabetes dataset well demonstrates how these features play well together. Meals that often happen subsequently appear close together and common chains of events and attributes appear grouped, making the trend stand out. Conversely, rarer events catch the eye as outliers not grouped with the others.</p><p>The output is a graph layout that supports many-event alignment </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Rank Assignment: Multiple Sequence Alignment</head><p>The shortest common supersequence is the sequence that contains all the sequences of a collection as subsequences. Given two sequences</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">X =&lt; x 1 ,...,x m &gt; and Y =&lt; y 1 , ..., y n &gt;, a sequence U =&lt; u 1 ,...,u k &gt;</formula><p>is a common supersequence of X and Y if items can be removed from U to produce X or Y. In our case, we want to find out the shortest common supersequence of our collection of sequences of events. This is known either as the multiple sequence alignment or the shortest supersequence problem. Sequences can be aligned by adding gaps, assigning a positive score to the matches, or a negative score to all the mismatches or gaps that are introduced. As an example, the result of aligning the two DNA sequences ATCGGTGAC and ACGGTATC by inserting gaps (-) could be:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ATCGGTGAC → ATCGGTGA-C → ATCGGTGATC ACGGTATC → A-CGGT-ATC → ..........</formula><p>Similarly, we map each event type to an alphabet letter and produce a general sequence of events that has all the sequences in our dataset as subsequences. There are several ways to perform multiple sequence alignment. A general approach is to use a graph to represent all possible alignments, and use a heuristic to help find a path through the graph that produces an alignment <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. However, due to the size that the graph can reach, this approach is only feasible for small numbers of sequences. Another one is progressive alignment, in which a multiple sequence alignment is built up gradually using a series of pairwise alignments <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>. Our approach is based on progressive alignment, finding out the best matching sequences through pairwise alignment and progressively aligning all the others. We used the Pairwise DNA Alignment implementation from <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> to obtain the supersequence. Although the algorithm is borrowed from a biomedical domain, pairwise DNA alignment can be used in any domain. This allows us to compute the shortest minimum supersequence of sequences with arbitrary event types for any domain. In this way, if we align these sequences:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Breakfast → Lunch → Snack → Dinner Lunch → Dinner → Snack Breakfast → Snack → Snack</formula><p>We would obtain this supersequence:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Breakfast → Lunch → Snack → Dinner → Snack</formula><p>The final result will be determined by the weight that is assigned to each possible gap or match. The weights that we used are: MATCH_SCORE : 10 BEGIN_GAP_PENALTY : 2 MISMATCH_SCORE : -50 GAP_PENALTY : 1 END_GAP_PENALTY : 2 In this way, we are indicating that mismatches are unacceptable, the insertion of gaps is discouraged but accepted, and that we prefer more gaps in the inner part of the sequences instead of outer buffers.</p><p>The use of the shortest common supersequence of events allows us to minimize the number of ranks and the distance between common subsequent events across all the sequences. While generating the supersequence, we abstain from making any assumptions about the order of meals, or the number of them. Since we don't make assumptions about the ordering of the events, our method is robust towards anomalies in the data and the messiness of real-world data [DR 4].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Building the Graph</head><p>We use a layered acyclic directed graph to represent our problem because it allows for a straightforward representation of sequences, and allowed us to map the terminology to already-existing intersection reduction techniques ongraphs. We represent each event as a node, and each relationship of sequentiality between two events as an edge.</p><p>The events in a sequence succeed each other in time, and there is no way for an event to be succeeded by another event that is prior in time. Therefore, the graph must be acyclic, which also allows for a consistent rank assignment. We build the graph using the supersequence obtained by the previous step. The depth (rank) of each node is determined by: cur_node.depth = cur_ref .indexOf(k such that k == cur_node.event_type)</p><p>We cycle through every node in a sequence, and slice the supersequence based on the depth of the previous node, thus making sure that the graph is acyclic. We then find in the sliced supersequence the next event that corresponds to the event type of the current node. Each edge that passes through a rank without having a node on it will be assigned an anchor: an object that behaves like a node in the sorting process but is not assigned to a group and does not have a graphical representation, and is only needed to assign a proper shape to the edge, in order to make it pass through without overlapping with any nodes.</p><p>All nodes belonging to the same group must be adjacent, without gaps or anchors between them. At this point, a rank contains a set of anchors and a set of groups, with each group containing one or more nodes. We then need order the elements in a rank on two levels: between groups and anchors, and between nodes within each group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3">Within-rank Node Sorting: intersection reduction heuristic</head><p>The vertical ordering is done following a heuristic approach based on Gansner et al.'s work <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> for intersection reduction, that in turn evolves from Sugiyama's method <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Gansner et al. describe a general approach including the assignment of ranks in a graph, but our ranks are already assigned at this point, so we only use their technique within each rank to establish a vertical order.  The sorting has to respect the following constraints: (1) If node A belongs to a higher group than node B, node A should always be positioned above node B. (2) Nodes in the same group should be adjacent.</p><p>Differently from the one by Gansner et al., our method produces a result that is less optimized for crossings, but is suited for the specific purpose of highlighting patterns. While their method starts with an initial assignment of the ranks, our ranks are given by the alignment algorithm. In the second step, when the ordering within the ranks is computed, we have additional constraints over a general layered graph that we need to respect: groups of nodes belonging to the same level must be bundled together, and they need to follow the specific order assigned to the general levels (e.g., in the case of the blood glucose dataset, 'very high' nodes must be above 'high' nodes). Beyond a general rank ordering, we also reorder the nodes within each group.</p><p>Initially, we define an order object: a two dimensional matrix having all the ranks on one dimension and the sorted nodes in each rank on the other dimension. After declaring a maximum number of iterations, we incrementally sort the nodes, alternating between starting from the leftmost rank and from the rightmost rank. The crossings() function counts how many intersections there are when a particular order is applied to the graph. We store the values in a temporary structure and find our best ordering by iteratively sweeping left and right: The structure is swept at each iteration alternately from left to right and from right to left.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.4">Linear Programming for Exact Intersection Reduction</head><p>The use of a heuristic for intersection reduction means no guarantees of finding the optimal solution. An approach to find the optimal solution is to formulate a linear program using the same constraints. Similar approaches have already been experimented with <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62]</ref>, and the pros and cons have been discussed by Gansner <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. We run a series of experiments using a solution based on Zarate et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. Although a linear programming approach finds an optimal and aesthetically pleasing solution for smaller graphs, this approach does not scale to higher numbers of edges. Indeed, while SEQUENCE BRAIDING is able to effortlessly process a graph with 1400 edges in 2 seconds, our linear programming approach ran out of memory. As representing more sequences was more relevant for us than displaying an optimal solution to the intersection reduction problem, we deemed the use of a heuristic more appropriate. Our linear programming implementation details and timing comparisons can be found in the appendix at osf.io/mq2wt.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Implementation</head><p>We built a free and open-source web-based visualization tool using JavaScript and the D3 library <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. SequenceBraiding.js uses the output of the graph layout algorithm to produce a visual representation. We use rounded rectangles to display the nodes, and splines for the edges between a node and the next. Each spline has anchor points before and after the traversed nodes that allow us to give the impression of seeing bundles of lines. Multiple gradients are applied to each spline reflecting the colors of the nodes it passes through. Many aspects are customizable. For example, the order of the groups can be forced: although the algorithm can guess it, it is at times necessary to impose an order, e.g., when the it is meaningful to the domain. Event types -or columnscan be filtered out by removing the ones that have fewer events than a threshold. This reduces the event types displayed, but can be useful to filter outliers in datasets with a very high number of events. Additional details can be added by combining complementary views <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In <ref type="figure">fig. 6</ref>, we show an example of how we combined multiple complementary views from a plugin that we built, that enables showing additional information and charts for each one of the sequences, and enables sorting by attribute values. Documentation, customizability and interactive usage examples are described on the SEQUENCE BRAIDING website 2 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">COMPARATIVE EVALUATION</head><p>We conducted a mixed methods comparative evaluation of SEQUENCE BRAIDING vs. a baseline visualization for understanding trends and patterns in event sequence data.

See the analysis plan there for complete details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Baseline for Comparison</head><p>We use IDMVis <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> as the baseline for comparison. IDMVis was designed to support type 1 diabetes treatment, using multiple views to support a large portion of the tasks that would take place during a clinical visit. Its main view uses several alignment techniques to enable comparing blood glucose levels at meals across several days, even if the meals did not happen at the same time each day. We only compare SEQUENCE BRAIDING with the main view from IDMVis as our focus is on showing high-level trends in an overview visualization. In fact, SEQUENCE BRAIDING could be a suitable drop-in replacement for the IDMVis main view. We limited our consideration of possible baselines for comparison to tools that: (1) support event sequence visualization, (2) support event alignment or aggregation by attributes, and <ref type="formula">3</ref>are open source or have otherwise available code for customization and evaluation. Candidates we considered include Storylines <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, Storyflow <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, and Sequence Bundles <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. However, we found each unsuitable due to substantially different purposes, constraints, or approaches. More details are available in the appendix at osf.io/mq2wt.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Tasks</head><p>The controlled experiment included 7 tasks, shown in the first column of <ref type="figure">fig. 9</ref> A . We designed these tasks based on Adrienko &amp; Adrienko's systematic approach for visualizing temporal data <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and the task analysis and abstraction for type 1 diabetes treatment developed by Zhang et al. for IDMVis <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, our baseline for comparison. We considered using well-cited task frameworks such as Brehmer et al.'s multi-level typology <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and Lee et al.'s taxonomy for graph visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. However, we found these frameworks to be too generic for helping us design our tasks. <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>: A plugin for SEQUENCE BRAIDING showing additional details about the sequences. Here, we used the type 1 diabetes dataset: the additional details for each sequences are the full date, day of the week, distribution of the intake of carbohydrates for each meal event, and percentage of time that day spent in pre-set blood glucose ranges. <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>: 200 chess openings displayed with SEQUENCE BRAIDING. Each line represents a sequence of moves of the white player, each group is a chess piece type. Most openings start with a pawn, and very little with the knight. After moving a pawn, it is common to move a knight or a pawn, it is a little less common to move a bishop, and only a little number of openings move the queen on the second move. Here we define the terminology used for our tasks. We contrast elementary tasks and synoptic tasks as per Adrienko &amp; Adrienko <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Elementary tasks relate to individual elements of the reference set, whereas synoptic tasks involve the whole reference set or its subsets <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. In SEQUENCE BRAIDING, an element of the reference set can be a single day represented by a line to indicate the time interval or a given event (e.g., meal) visualized by a rounded rectangle. A lookup elementary task means finding a characteristic relative to a specified element. An inverse task involves having the participant find an element or relevant subset for a given characteristic. For tasks including the term behavior, we mean a generalisation of notions such as distribution, variation, and trends -and behavior comparison indicates measuring the degree of similarity/difference between behaviors for multiple given reference sets. Relation seeking indicates finding occurrences of specified relations between characteristics and determining the corresponding elements or reference sets, while pattern identification is the synoptic equivalent of an elementary lookup task. We further refined the task selection based on the task analysis and abstraction examined by Zhang et al. for IDMVis <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> to support a more realistic comparison and our case study on type 1 diabetes treatment. We include tasks that support overviews; focusing on identifying and comparing trends, patterns, and outliers; as well as investigating data quality such as missing data. We only considered tasks which could be performed using both SEQUENCE BRAIDING and the main view in IDMVis, e.g., SEQUENCE BRAIDING does not display precise timing and IDMVis does not support aligning more than two meal labels at the same time, eliminating tasks that require these encodings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Stimuli and Questions</head><p>We formulated 7 multiple-choice questions instantiating our selected tasks for the controlled experiment. In our within-subjects study, each participant answered each of these questions using both visualizations generated by SEQUENCE BRAIDING and IDMVis. The order of the questions was counterbalanced to avoid ordering effects using a Latin square design. We used the CGM and meal log event sequence data from IDMVis <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> and its associated study <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> to build our stimuli. Each question uses a different set of 14 days sampled from the dataset. The data contained anomalies due to human error. SEQUENCE BRAID-ING is robust towards anomalies, but we wanted to make sure to avoid confusing our participants so we eliminated days with problematic ambiguities. E.g., breakfasts recorded at 9 PM or lunches recorded after dinners. As a result, the selected days for a question are not necessarily consecutive but are from the same rough time period. We also smoothed out places in the CGM curve where rapid changes co-occurred with events relevant to our questions so as to avoid ambiguity.</p><p>Mark and font sizes were kept as similar as possible for the two visualizations. The dots in IDMVis and the nodes in SEQUENCE BRAIDING had similar heights. In IDMVis colored dots are used to show time series data and triangles show events, while SEQUENCE BRAIDING uses colored nodes for less frequent events and their attribute values. SEQUENCE BRAIDING also uses lines to show event sequences while IDMVis uses rows. Meal name fonts were also similar sizes. All the stimuli can be found in our supplemental material at osf.io/mq2wt.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Procedure</head><p>We used a within-subjects approach. Authorized by the Institutional Review Board of our institution, we recruited participants using flyers at our institution and posting ads on Facebook. We ran a pilot study before recruitment that helped us evaluate duration, feasibility, and adverse events; verify our assumptions; and find flaws in the design. Based on the pilot study, we conducted power analysis (with Type I error rate α = 0.05, power 1 − β = 0.80 ) to determine the number of total participants. We determined we needed at least 25 participants to achieve consistent results for tasks 1, 4, 6, and 7. 16 males, 8 females, and one that preferred not to say participated in our study. The median age was 24 years old (IQR = 6), 5 participants held a Doctorate, 7 a Master's degree, 9 a Bachelor's degree, and 4 a high school degree or equivalent. In this in-person study, participants first signed a consent form for recording audio and video, confirming they were at least 18 years of age and comfortable being interviewed in English, and acknowledging the IRB terms. Participants were then given a laptopa Dell XPS 9570 with a 15-inch non-reflective screen running Firefox 68 on Ubuntu 18.04 -, mouse, keyboard, blank paper, pens, and a </p></div>

After completing these, participants viewed a tutorial about the second visualization, followed by the other set of 7 associated questions. We alternated between participants starting from IDMVis and starting from SEQUENCE BRAIDING. Our web app registered their answers and completion time for each question answered, showed the correct answer after they confirmed their answer, and stored the data for later analysis. At the end, they filled in a survey with demographic and feedback questions. Each participant was paid with a $10 Amazon gift card.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">From NHST to Interval Estimation</head><p>Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) tests a null hypothesis and uses the p-value to decide whether to reject that hypothesis. Most descriptions of statistical testing only focus on NHST for claiming a definitive statistical significance <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. However, p-values are not definitive proofs of significance and it is dangerous to use a predefined threshold like p &lt; .05 to separate real results from the false ones. A more refined goal of statistical analysis is to provide an evaluation of certainty or uncertainty regarding the size of an effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Interval Estimation involves providing information about a range in which the true value lies with a certain degree of probability. Confidence intervals are examples of interval estimates. Reporting both confidence intervals and p-values helps better understand what's happening in the data than p-values alone because they provide complementary information <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Measures and Analysis</head><p>For each task, we measured the completion time and accuracy. The accuracy is quantified at two levels of granularity for each question. First, we determined the correctness, a binary measure of whether or not the participant got the correct answer. Second, for the tasks which had numerical answers, we report the amount of error (ER) using ER =| O p − O t | /O t , where the O p and O t represent the option that the participant selected and answered correctly, respectively. In this tasks study, the ER was only applicable to the first four.</p><p>To analyze our experiment data, we used both NHST and interval estimation. We formed the null hypothesis as follows based on our objective with this evaluation: There is no meaningful difference between SEQUENCE BRAIDING and IDMVis in correctness, error rate, and completion time for tasks involving lookup, comparison, relationseeking, pattern comparison, and pattern identification of quantitatively abstractions when investigating time-oriented variables.</p><p>We first tested for normality with two methods qualitatively and quantitatively by using Q-Q plots and the Shapiro-Wilk test respectively. Our results showed that our data does not have a normal distribution. Therefore, we used chi-square test for independence to analyze correctness and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test as the nonparametric alternative to the dependent t-test to analyze time and error rate. We adjusted all p-values using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> to control the false discovery rate. We report mean completion time and use the natural logarithm of the ratio of means as effect size -natural log ratios are the only symmetric, additive, and normed indicators of relative change <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. We also report the mean accuracy and use the difference between the samples means as effect size. Last, we report mean error magnitude. For each of these we report bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to indicate the range of plausible values <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p></div>

Completion time: Participants spent up to 2.5 times longer with IDMVis than SEQUENCE BRAIDING and we have strong evidence to support this difference. This is the largest difference in task completion time that we have observed. Accuracy: We have good evidence that participants were meanginfully more correct using SEQUENCE BRAIDING than IDMVis.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1">Task Type Matters</head><p>Overall we found that there is good evidence that participants are faster using SEQUENCE BRAIDING than IDMVis. This time improvement was primarily on tasks which involved analyzing the sequentiality of events (T4, T5, T6, T7). The most outstanding time improvement, as well as the only big correctness difference, is found in T6 which involved comparing two time intervals and finding a pattern. Two 14-day IDMVis visualizations incur substantial visual complexity, as the user is effectively looking at 28 small multiples visualizations in two groups. Conversely, SEQUENCE BRAIDING is capable of a much more compact and less complex representation still very fit for the task. Another large difference occurs in T2, a task for which SEQUENCE BRAIDING is effectively a stacked bar chart. It is thus not surprising that position on an unaligned scale is a more effective encoding than color luminance for this quantitative task <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2">Qualitative Explanations for Quantitative Results</head><p>We also collected participants' subjective evaluation of the two visualizations. A high-level summary is shown in <ref type="figure">fig. 9</ref> B , D , E . Validating a novel algorithm and visualization tool using clock-wall evaluations (e.g., time and accuracy) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> alone can provide insights on the tool performance. However, our qualitative findings may provide explanations of why SEQUENCE BRAIDING outperformed IDMVis.</p><p>As one approach to examine why SEQUENCE BRAIDING performs better, we conducted affinity diagramming <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> to analyze the qualitative results. It highlighted two benefits of using SEQUENCE BRAIDING: it (1) helps identify overall patterns, and (2) can be more suitable for more complex datasets with longer duration.</p><p>We also looked at specific ratings provided by participants. Participants reported feeling more confident performing tasks using SE-QUENCE BRAIDING vs. IDMVis ( <ref type="figure">fig. 9 B</ref> ) -mean 0.63 points higher on a 1-5 scale. Likewise, participants preferred SEQUENCE BRAIDING vs. IDMVis regarding ease of use for understanding trends and patterns B -mean 0.79 points higher on a 1-5 scale. Furthermore, 53% of the participants reported SEQUENCE BRAIDING as most useful for displaying trends, vs. 36% for IDMVis E .</p><p>We also examined the strategies participants claimed to use when reading the visualizations ( <ref type="figure">fig. 9 C )</ref>. In both cases focusing on color was most common. With SEQUENCE BRAIDING, participants also used many other strategies in concert. But only one other strategy was given for IDMVis -counting dots. This suggests that SEQUENCE BRAIDING users would pick and choose from the encodings most relevant or comfortable for their task. Moreover, the strategies reported for SEQUENCE BRAIDING are perhaps at more focused on higher-level patterns vs. inferring patterns by reading small multiples visualizations in IDMVis. It stands to reason that the difference in strategies used influenced the higher confidence scores B , perceived ease B , and perceived usefulness E of SEQUENCE BRAIDING vs. IDMVis -as well as the timing and overall smaller error rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.3">When to Use Sequence Braiding</head><p>SEQUENCE BRAIDING was originally developed to easily represent several weeks or months of meal logs for diabetic patients, with the event sequence folded <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> by day. We believe our method is most effective on data with similar characteristics. In particular, our alignment approach will be most helpful in cases where there is no apriori canonical ordering of event types. Our algorithm is robust to human-generated data which is prone to containing inconsistencies or situations with a mixed ordering or acyclically repeating event types. Likewise, the visual design of SEQUENCE BRAIDING is most directly applicable to domains in which attribute value and sequence overviews are important to see, where precursor and aftereffect events must be known, and where it is valuable to show specific sequences individually. However, it would not be useful in cases where specific times of events or time deltas between them are important -at least without added interactivity or additional encodings. There are also algorithmic and visual scalability considerations. We have not calculated exact numbers for how many sequences, event types, or events in a sequence will work in general, but we discuss the overall constraints and refer readers to more examples in the appendix at osf.io/mq2wt. The worst-case runtime complexity of our layout is O(k • m • n 2 log(n)), with k iterations, m ranks from alignment, and n sequences. Experimentally, we can lay out 125 sequences in less than a second using JavaScript on a commodity laptop. See the appendix at osf.io/mq2wt for details. The visualization scales well with more sequences, but worse with longer sequences and many event types. Additional ranks from the alignment require much more screen space than additional lines and associated nodes. If sequences are not necessary to perceive individually, visual scalability can be improved by reducing the gap between lines and their thickness (configuration options). Moreover, the visualization can use scrolling, zooming, or mouseover highlighting to explore relevant subsets or sequences. If appropriate, filtering out infrequent sequences of events also reduces the visual complexity substantially.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>Although we claim that SEQUENCE BRAIDING is useful for understanding trends, it does not allow for examining precise details, such as the timing of the events or exact attribute values. In addition, since we use heuristics to position nodes, the solution is not necessarily minimal in terms of intersections. The version we used in the experiment did not include any interactivity in order to reduce the number of variables that could influence the results. Currently, events with missing data (without associated values) are discarded. Initially we kept them in the visualization and displayed them as belonging to an 'unknown' type positioned using only the minimum intersection heuristic. We removed the feature due to the additional complexity added, but adding it back would increase robustness with regards to missing data.</p></div>

Accuracy: Participants had similar correctness and error rates using SEQUENCE BRAIDING and IDMVis.</figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="3">Task 1: elementary lookup</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">time avg</cell><cell cols="4">95% CI p-value avg ln(S/I) 95%CI ln(S/I)</cell></row><row><cell cols="3">SB 35.4 [27.8, 43.3] IDMVis 39.6 [28.8, 50.8]</cell><cell>0.78</cell><cell>-0.12</cell><cell>[-0.26, 0.03]</cell></row><row><cell>accuracy</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">avg ln(I-S) 95%CI ln(I-S)</cell></row><row><cell cols="3">SB 0.76 [0.58, 0.93] IDMVis 0.88 [0.74, 1.00]</cell><cell>1.00</cell><cell>0.12</cell><cell>[-0.12, 0.37]</cell></row><row><cell>error rate</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="3">SB 0.28 [0.06, 0.50] IDMVis 0.16 [0.00, 0.35]</cell><cell>0.60</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="6">Completion time: We have minimal evidence that SEQUENCE BRAIDING</cell></row><row><cell cols="6">mean completion time is slightly shorter than IDMVis.
