				<p>As part of an inter-disciplinary effort, we are visually exploring a current problem in philosophical logic related to information processing. Given a set of inconsistent sentences or inputs, a processor cannot unambiguously infer any specific consequence. Traces represent subsets of possible consequences which can be inferred classically from partitions of the set of inputs. We are interested in the relationship between a given set of Boolean inputs and its respective trace(s). We have developed a visualization paradigm which allows us to view and explore this relationship effectively.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Philosophy is one of the few fields which has so far experienced limited benefit from visualization. Some of its areas of research are too abstract and couched in specialized terms in natural language, making visual representation difficult.</p><p>In contrast, logic is a highly formalized field of study which is generally accessible to graphic techniques. Despite this fact, logic has yet to be explored to any significant extent through visualization.</p><p>Collaborating between the departments of philosophy, mathematics and computer science, we are visually exploring a current logic problem, propositional n-traces, as an adjunct to traditional research techniques.</p><p>The philosophical interest in traces arises from the case in which C is a set of sentences or data. In particular, suppose that C records information received by a central processor from N distinct channels. Each channel is self-consistent but the distinct channels may supply conflicting data. Then C will contain no sentence of the form pi A YX, but it may contain both the sentences cv, -KX. Now suppose that the processor is required to draw or test inferences from C. If the processor adopts the methods of standard logic, then when separate channels have supplied conflicting information, it is justified to infer every sentence of the language. To avoid this, it must be given some comparatively conservative inference strategy. One such strategy described fully in <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> re-deploys standard inferential methods in a way which introduces a relative measure of incoherence and provides a formulation for incoherence tolerant inference.</p><p>We define Z(C), the incoherence level of C, as the cardinal of the least partition of C into consistent (non-contradictory) subsets. Then any sentence can be inferred from C that is inferable by standard methods from at least one cell1 of every l(C)-partition of C. In our implementation, we define a set 7" which is an l(C)-trace over C for which the processor will infer ,/3, if p is a standard consequence of every element of T'.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1.1</head><p>The Problem Suppose C is a set of inputs C = {Qir, 012, as..., a,}. Then the set g@) is the power set, the set of all subsets of C. Each sentence can be viewed as an arbitrary source of information but here is considered as a Boolean value. Then Tn C g@) is an n-trace over the set C iff for every n-partition 7r of C some element of Tn is a subset of some cell of X. Equivalently</p><p>Tn is an n-trace for C iff no n-partition of C partitions every element of T". More specifically, we are interested in the proper minimal n-trace which is the smallest set whose members part every n-partition of C and contain no subset that is an n-trace for any smaller number of inputs.</p><p>For example, let C = {a, p, y, 6) be a set of sew is the proper minimal 2-trace. The set is a 3-trace for C. And the trivial trace, {{a}} is an n-trace over C for any n.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1.2</head><p>The a-Trace We restrict our attention to the case where n = 2. We use the formulation of the 2-trace T2</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">f(T2) = A{V(r E T")}</formula><p>which forms the conjunctions of elements of T2 and then disjoins the results. </p><p>2 Visualization</p><p>Prior efforts at visualizing traces have been limited to pen and paper graph theoretic representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>. Consequently only a small number of inputs have been "visualized" and only in a very limited context. We have employed a geometrical representation, invoking an idea derived from the InfoCrystal by Sporri <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The InfoCrystal is an application for representing database query results using an extended definition of the wellknown Venn diagram. This technique presents the relationship of t,he data elements, based on the disjunct and conjunct fmlctions of set theory, and uses the ensemble representations to explore such relationships  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 1</ref>). It is a very simple but effective way of presenting all the inputs and their conjunctions.</p><p>Initially, for a given N inputs, all possible conjunctions or n-tuples are calculated. Then starting from pre-calculated sets for T: and T:, the "two-of-three" operation. Eqn( 1) is applied iteratively using the recursive expression Eqn( 2)) generating successive traces T,$. After each iteration, the generated set is reduced to the proper minimal set. The data can then be displayed to demonstrate any number of relationships between the inputs, the minimal traces and the full set of conjunctions. The interface allows the user to examine the following: All conjunctions for N inputs can be plotted, the color of each point representing a conjunction corresponding to the size of its n-tuple (i.e. the smallest n-tuple, a pair, is red and the largest, an N-tuple, is violet, colors ranging through the entire spectrum; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 1</ref>).</p><p>The :minimal trace for N inputs can be plotted, either alone or overlayed on the conjunctions, with color similarly assigned by size of n-tuple. Each member can be identified from an adjacent text listing (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 3</ref>).</p><p>For each member of the trace, the conjunctions which are reduced by that member can be shown apart from the rest of the set (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4</ref>).</p><p>Trac'es for different N can be overlayed for comparison.</p><p>The 8evolution of 5-+N inputs can be shown as an anim.ation, either for the minimal trace or for the full set of conjunctions (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref>). Additional inputs are introduced in a continuous animation, changing the geometry of the trace gradually.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Observations</head><p>Although work is only just underway exploring the significance of the visualization results, a number of interesting features are immediately obvious. First among them is the distinct difference between the appearance of the conjunction set for odd and even numbers of inputs. The image for N (even) is much less luminous than for N -1 (odd). This is born out by a distribution analysis of the data points which show that all points for N odd are geometrically unique and therefore visible while there are many duplications for N even2. This has drawn attention to the distinction between odd and even numbers of inputs and st,imulated efforts to draw analytic conclusions.</p><p>Also apparent is that the minimal trace for sufficiently large N appears as a spiral originating near 'The loss of information due to duplication is unimportant since t.he case of N even is essentially degenerate with N -1</p><p>Odd.</p><p>the first input and converging on the center. Inspection of the the members of the trace shows this to be no surprise. The larger n-tuples are more evenly weighted on average by their conjuncts and tend to appear near the center. The trace's pairs, while appearing throughout the circle, are selected out early in the iterations and move out towards the edge. The animation of the trace makes the origins of the spiral most apparent. Its peculiar appearance hints at the form that the trace may have in the limit of iV-+co.</p><p>The evolution of the minimal trace with increasing N shows a peculiar dynamics involving the three largest members of any given trace (i.e. those closest to the center). All other members of that trace remain constant and are not affected by the addition of a new input. This has brought the influence of the particular recursive algorithm that is used under inspection.</p><p>Finally, the relative distributions of the conjunctions parted by any particular member of the trace appear to be very distinct from one another. Each occupies a different area, has a different center of mass and demonstrates a unique pattern (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4</ref>). It is apparent from working with the interface that certain points are shared between them but details await a detailed analysis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4</ref> Future Work</p><p>Several issues remain to be resolved before new directions are undertaken. These are central to the inference problem and would represent significant steps forward. Foremost is the algorithmetization of the ntrace function and a representation for arbitrary ntraces. Also is the issue of the isomorphic nature of traces. It is hoped that the visualization will indicate where and what to look for when trying to identify the members of various isomorphic families. This may require a more sophisticated representation so that the reduced members can be easily separated from the background.</p><p>In addition we wish to move towards a syntactic visualization of the logical operations. The current representation is largely semantic and limits the generalizations which can be deduced from the output. It is unclear how this might be accomplished unambiguously for complex operations.</p><p>Finally, both the underlying theory and the interface are being modified to represent the continuous limit N-+oo. This will present interesting challenges for the visualization paradigm which currently relies on the discrete nature of the data.    One of its members has been selected (a 2-tuple highlighted in red) and the conjunctions which are parted by that members appear as a scatterplot in red.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>For example, if Ti E T2(a, A Y) = {ia, PI, {a, ~1, {P, ~1) then .f(T:) = (a A P) V (a A Y) v (P A 7). (1) This formula can easily be programmed for the analysis of inputs of any arbitrary N Boolean values. To show the dependence of the proper minimal trace members on N, the t,races Ti for N = 3,4 and 5 and inputs C = {a, b, c, d, e} are: T; = Habl, {a~)&gt; @cl) T: = {{ab), {UC}, (4, {WI Tt = {{ab}, {UC}, {bed}, {bee}, {de}} Tlf for any arbitrary N inputs, {a, b, c, ... , oN} can be expressed as a recursive function T; = f(T:)(T,&amp;l,T,k2,~~).</figDesc></figure>

Points represent,ing the conjunctions are then displayed within the unit circle at positions determined by their constituent inputs. Each conjunction's (5,~) position is calculated as the average position of every input which contributes to it. For example, xabc = (ra + :cb + ~~)/3.
