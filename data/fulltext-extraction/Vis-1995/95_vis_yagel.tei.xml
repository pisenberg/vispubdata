				<p>Because of the nature of the die casting process, the part geometry severely restricts the die geometry and hence affects the quality of the part. Howevel; as is ofen the case in other manufacturing processes, diecastings are currently designed purely based on their function. The manufacturability of the diecastings is not considered until the design has been nearly completed and detailed. This is due to the design support limitations of current CAE tools. In this papel; we present a new volume-based approach to support diecastability evaluation, especially in preliminary design. Our approach can be applied to arbitrarily shaped parts without pre-defined feature libraries. The focus is on the identljication of geometric characteristics, e.g. heavy mass regions, that could be responsible for thermal-related part defects. A distance transform with city-block metric is used to extract this geometric property. Volume visualization techniques are also adopted to allow users to visualize the results in a clear and precise way.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Die casting is a manufacturing process in which high speed molten metal is injected into the various shaped cavities of a reusable steel die and then solidifies there under high pressure. Because of its capability to produce parts with complex geometry in high volume, die casting has gained great popularity in many markets, especially in the auto industry. However, the development of die casting products is a very complex process where many factors, in addition to part design, must be considered such as parting line location, cooling system design, gate and runner design, vent location, and die layout design. Traditionally, these activities have been performed sequentially and separately. Therefore, the part design is often incompatible with the die casting process, making the die design unnecessarily expensive and often times causing defects in the final product.</p><p>To meet the high demand in today's industry for the production of competitive products in a shorter cycle, design for manufacture (DFM) has emerged as a new design philosophy. By keeping the die-casting process advantages as well as limitations in mind while in the design sta,ge, it will result in fewer die tryouts and part rejections. The products will then conform to the functional requirements better and will be more economical to produce. In our work we strive to furnish the designer with simple and1 efficient analysis tools to support DFM.</p><p>There are currently two types of manufacturability evaluation techniques in use to assist in the design of quality die casting parts. The first type is known as knowledgebased system which are limited in scope since they cannot reliably handle the range of complex part geometries found in die casting <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>. The second type of tools is based on finite element, finite difference, or boundary element methods <ref type="bibr">[.5</ref>]. These tools involve very long run times (sometimes days). Furthermore, an understanding of the assumptions behind the model is critical to correctly interpret the res8ults.</p><p>In this paper, we presents a qualitative reasoning approach based on a volumetric part representation for diecastabiliity evaluation. In contrast to conventional tools, this approach provides a more consistent and robust assessment of the part geometry by identifying the underlying geometric characteristics behind the design rules which actually affect part quality or increase manufacturing difficulties. Volume-based geometric reasoning is used to extract this information in a form which can be easily interpreted by designers via volume visualization techniques <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. Hot spot related problems in die casting are used as an example to demonstrate our approach. The results havse been implemented as a platform-transparent diecastability evaluation program which is integrated with existing CAD systems used by designers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Voxel-Based Diecastability Evaluation</head><p>In contrast to conventional models, a voxel-based model is used here for the extraction of the geometric characteristics which are responsible for solidification related problems from the part design. Specialized volume (See color plates, page  results in the original CAD model, volume data itself is rendered and the voxels which are considered to be the potential problem regions are highlighted. A volume rendering tool based on template ray casting [8] was incorporated. It supports a user/computer generated color lookup table, and voxel semi-transparency based on a front-toback color cornpositing model. When applying the template-based ray casting for the visualization of the heavy mass regions, the voxels belonging to the part are first divided into three different layers. The skin layer contains voxels on the boundary of the part, usually one or two voxels thick. These voxels are assigned a gray-scale color, and a see-through opacity. In addition, these voxels are shaded based on the normal vectors inherited from the polygon model to provide a clearer picture of the voxelized object. The second layer, i.e. the core layer, is basically the voxels which are considered to be the potential heavy mass. In other words, it contains the voxels with a distance value greater than a certain value. The core voxels are totally opaque, and have a red color. A new contextual shading method is then applied to the voxels in this layer to present the heavy sections in a 3-D perspective. The intermediate layer contains all the voxels between the skin and the core. These voxels are totally transparent and are skipped by the rays. This method improves the usually foggy semi-transparent voxel images and allows the designer to assess the geometry of the 3-D part design by viewing the relatively heavy mass regions inside. Thus, the designer can easily conceive the locations of the heavy mass regions relative to the part, and make design modifications accordingly.</p><p>The choice of the threshold value for the mass region is crucial. We observe that heavy mass usually happens when the pattern of the core changes while it shrinks towards the inside. In other words, if a series of images are animated with the core shrinking, the designer should easily conceive the heavy mass by observing the shape of the core. We provide an animation tool that renders a sequence of images while varying the threshold value. Since the viewing angle is the same and the core is shrinking, only the rays which do hit the core, need to be traced again.</p><p>The images in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> show how the heavy sections of diecasting can be identified. The identification of these regions is based on distance transform to the part boundary, as described before, and utilizes a 1283 volume. The scan conversion of the object into voxels took 25 sec. for 1,631 facets, the distance transform took 3 sec., and rendering took 8 sec. We use an IBM R6000 37T workstation with 64 MB memory and Power Gt4e Graphics Adapter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Future Work</head><p>Our current efforts are directed towards extending this method to cover more issues in both solidification-and filling-related problems. For example, another concern in die casting solidification, besides heavy mass, is the identification and visualization of relative hot regions in the die, which may cause heat checking and thermal fatigue related defects. There are several design rules related to this concern, e.g. the distance between two ribs, and the radius of holes. The approach described in this paper can be used to find whether the ribs are relatively too big; however, it can not tell the distance between them. For two closely spaced ribs, even though they are of an appropriate size, the part is still poorly configured from the perspective of solidification. To extend our approach to cover this problem, other geometric data processing, reasoning, and visualization methods are required.</p><p>rendering and visualization techniques are adapted to convey the potential problem region more naturally to the designer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Geometric Characteristics Identification</head><p>For solidification related problems, one concern in die casting design is the identification of thermal mass, i.e. the locations of the last regions to solidify. By identifying and possibly eliminating this problem early in the design process, we might be able to reduce cycle time, improve product quality, and cut costs <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. There are several feature oriented design rules aimed at achieving this, e.g. the aspect ratio of bosses. However, it is difficult to directly apply these rules in a computer system to guarantee manufacturability. Purely from a geometric point of view, thermal mass is approximately associated with the region where the local bounded volume in the cavity is relatively large, i.e. thick section. Naturally, there are many processrelated factors contributing to the thermal mass problem. However, eliminating unnecessary heavy masses in the preliminary design based on part geometry alone will significantly simplify the die design issues, and will reduce the scrap rate. Hence, the regions in a part with excessive masses, i.e. potential hot spots, should be pointed out to the designers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Voxelization</head><p>After an extensive evaluation of the possible representation schemes, the voxel-based model and its associated processing and reasoning techniques were selected to support diecastability evaluation. Based on this representation, some volumetric geometric characteristics, such as total volume and surface area, though approximate, are readily available. Since solidification of diecastings is a volumetric phenomenon, the voxel model lends itself to the identification of geometric properties affecting part solidification. In the voxel model, voxel-based data processing techniques, e.g. distance transformation, can be used to extract the volume-related geometric characteristics from the part model with little effort. This is the major benefit of adopting this model in diecastability evaluation.</p><p>A voxelization algorithm that converts an existing CAD models to the desired voxel model was implemented. To make the proposed system readily transferable to other platforms, polygon-based model is used as a vehicle between the commonly used B-Rep model in CAD systems and the voxel model. The polygon model (a simplified B-Rep model) can be obtained by conversion routines available in most commercial CAD systems. Unlike existing methods <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>, our robust algorithm is capable of dealing with slivers, boundary voxels, and faces parallel to the major axes <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Volmme-based Reasoning: Heavy Mass Identificaltion</head><p>The distance transformation is a tool used in image processing. Its applications include dilation, erosion, skeletonization, etc. Basically, it transforms a binary image S into a gray-scale image G <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>. The value in G is the distance from a voxel in S to the closest voxel in the conjugate image of S. In other words, the value means the distance from an inner point in an object to its closest boundary. If the distance transformation is applied to the part relative to the die, each voxel in the part will have a value indicating its distance to the die. From the perspective of a distance transform, heavy mass regions consist of voxels with a relatively long distance to the die boundary. These can be extracted and visualized from the distance field of the voxelized model. Distance is defined in terms of metrics. To decide the proper metric for an application, one needs to consider the characteristics of the problem at hand and also the computational efficiency. Since "heavy" section is a relative term, only ,the correct order in the distance data needs to be maintained in the transform. In addition, heat can only flow across the face-connected voxels according to the Fourier law. Thus, the city-block metric is more suited to extract the heavy sections which usually accompany thermal-related1 part defects, and most importantly it is extremely efficient in terms of computation. Therefore, the city-block metric is used here to extract the heavy mass region in the part. We employ an efficient non-recursive algorithm that computes the distance transform in two passes through the volume [ 11.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Visualization</head><p>After the identification of the relatively heavy mass regions, another challenge in this research is to appropriately present this information in a way that is consistent with what the designer is looking for. Visualization techniques play an important role here. Conventional post processing tools used in numerical simulation rely heavily on the designers' expertise in preparing and interpreting the results. Most knowledge/rule based approaches simply highlight the problems through graphics or text by consulting built-in rules, and usually have difficulties in adjusting the results for different situations.</p><p>Since the reasoning and processing are performed on the voxel-based model, volume visualization techniques are naturally adopted here.
