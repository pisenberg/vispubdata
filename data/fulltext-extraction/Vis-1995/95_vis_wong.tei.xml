Major research achievements during the first decade included the Morlet wavelet, the Meyer wavelet, the Battle Lemarie wavelet, the Daubechies wavelet, and Mallat's multiresolution representation <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>. The last has become the de facto algorithm for most, if not all, wavelet applications in computer graphics and visualization for the last several years. Some of these efforts include volume rendering <ref type="bibr">[12, 131, radiosity and textures [7, 51, volume morphing [8]</ref>, progressive transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>, spacetime control <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>, painting <ref type="bibr">[ 11, curves [4]</ref>, and shape models <ref type="bibr">[ 171.</ref> We are interested in using wavelets to provide a progressive refinement environment for scientific data visualization <ref type="bibr">[ 191.</ref> Such an environment should allow a scientist to visualize massive amounts of data at a coarse resolution to identify areas that warrant investigation at finer resolutions. To be effective the coarse resolutions must provide an accurate visual representation of the finer resolutions. In particular we would like to ensure that important patterns in the high resolution data are evident in the visualization of the low resolution data. Unfortunately, the definition of what is important is both application and task-dependent. On the other hand, we can develop a common evaluation and representation of the accuracy of a coarse resolution based on the loss of information between the coarse resolution and the fine resolution representations. We call this the authenticity of the representation.</p><p>The goal of this paper is to investigate the authenticity issues of the wavelet approximations. Common approaches of error measures for lossy reconstructions are discussed.</p><p>We define the meaning offinctionpattem, which we use to measure the quality of the approximations. Six test datasets, each with different characteristics, are used to clarify facts and pitfalls of orthogonal wavelets. An error tracking mechanism, which does not require any post-transformation computation, is presented with real life examples.</p></div>

For example, in interval; it can be represented by its dilation f (2z), together with the translate of its dilation f (2x -l), which are piecewise constant on half unit intervals.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Multiresolution analysis</head><p>In practice, we can only measure or record scientific data in discrete values. A wavelet implementation on discrete data is given by Mallat <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>.</p><p>Given a one-dimensional dataset with N items at resolution j, an application of an orthogonal wavelet decomposition generates $! coefficients of low frequency approximations, and ff coefficients of high frequency details at resolution j -1, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>. The coefficients correspond to the bases in 6 -1 i-2 and Wj-1 discussed in Section 2.1. From Equation (4), we know that this operation can be applied iteratively on the approximations to get increasingly coarse data, for as long as the size of the approximations 2 2p, where p is the number of vanishing moments of the wavelet. (We discuss vanishing moment in more detail below.)</p><p>Wavelet transforms are invertible. If both the approximations and the details of any one resolution are available, it is possible to have a lossless reconstruction of the approximations of the next finer resolution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">General error measure</head><p>Applications of wavelets are developing rapidly in both graphics and visualization research. Many of them rely on the vanishing moment property of the wavelet transform, in which a substantial amount of wavelet detail is ignored because of its relatively insignificant values. The process is usually followed by a reverse transform operation, which produces a lossy reconstruction. This is by far the most popular application of wavelets.</p><p>A common way to measure the effectiveness of a lossy operation is by visual comparison based on feature classification by a human being on a small number of features such as the peak value and fundamental frequency. This subjective method assumes medium-sized data which can be displayed in a single picture.</p><p>Traditionally, applications which require higher error accuracy might use more objective (quantitative) measures such as the root-mean-square error, given by <ref type="formula">5</ref>where fi and fi are the original and the reconstructed data respectively. Unfortunately, however, this method requires both functions to be the same size, which is not the case when comparing a function with its coarse-resolution reconstructions. Furthermore, it is not always the case that objective measures are better than subjective ones.</p><p>In our application [ 191 we combine objective and subjective error measures in an interactive environment to explore data. Orthogonal wavelets provide fine to coarse resolutions to browse terabyte sized scientific data and search for information. The wavelet approximations give an overview of the very large data set at a lower resolution, and the details of each resolution allow the reconstruction of the data in higher resolutions once interesting targets are located. Obviously, the zoomed data has a much smaller size than the original, so conventional error measures such as the rootmean-square method cannot be used. Instead of computing an error measure based on comparing the approximation coefficients to the input data, we compute one based on the detail coefficients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Authenticity analysis</head><p>We would like to have some mechanism for validating that a lower resolution representation of a signal is an authentic approximation. Fortunately, by using a wavelet representation, the energy loss due to space projection can be obtained from the wavelet details of each resolution. Once we define a measure of the energy loss, we can use that measure for both analysis and visualization of the error. Defining an error measure that is consistent throughout the wavelet coefficient hierarchy is complicated by the change in coefficient scale and the different numbers of coefficients at each level of the hierarchy. For our initial experimentation, we have chosen an error metric in which the total error due to projection from spaces 5+i to I$ is given by <ref type="formula">6</ref>where wjk is the wavelet detail at resolution j. Even this simple measure shows positive visual results as shown in Section 5, but more research is needed to determine how it compares to other potential measures.</p><p>It is known that some wavelets lose more energy than others during decomposition. This brings us to the discussion of vanishing moments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Vanishing moments</head><p>Our discussion is restricted to compactly supported orthogonal wavelets. Others such as the Morlet wavelet and the Meyer wavelet have infinite support on the whole real line because they use sinusoids as the building blocks. They are C".</p><p>The accuracy of piecewise wavelet approximation can be characterized by the number of vanishing moments p of the wavelet. Strang <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref> describes this as how well the polynomials 1, x, x2, . . . , xp-' are reproduced by the approximation. For a wavelet $ withp vanishing moments, where m = 0, . . , p -1. In wavelet literature, the value of 2p is usually used as a subscript to identify a wavelet. This comes from the fact that the number of coefficients of a wavelet filter with p vanishing moments is equal to 2p.  D20 (Daubechies wavelets withp = 2,6, and IO.) It is also true that a compactly supported wavelet with p vanishing moments is p times continuously differentiable, i.e., CP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Function pattern</head><p>In this paper, the pattern of a function is loosely defined by its shape or look rather than its mathematical definition. Since most graphic displays are normalized in our application <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref>, the number of a function's extreme values (i.e., local maximum and minimum) and their relative locations are far more important than the absolute values. Following the same philosophy, we pay more attention to thefrequency or the period of a periodic function than its amplitude.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Approximation characteristics</head><p>In this section, compactly supported orthogonal wavelets withp = 1 to 10 are applied to sinusoid-based test data with different patterns. Due to limited space, we only plot the results generated by wavelets HZ and 020, which represent the lowest and the highest number of vanishing moments in our discussion. These examples are used to clarify the approximation characteristics of orthogonal wavelets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">Effect of vanishing moment on merging of data</head><p>A higher number of vanishing moments implies more coefficients in a wavelet filter matrix, which means that the implementation requires that more numbers be multiplied and added (merged) together during decomposition. However, the features in the data are not necessarily merged any faster. This is illustrated by a sinusoid with 2g = 512 discrete samples shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>.  first resolution of the decomposition. The left half is the approximation and the right is the detail. The tiny wavelet detail indicates good approximation for both wavelets. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref> shows the same signal represented with 28 = 256 wavelet coefficients. Both wavelets show strong approximations and weak details, with DZO having smaller details.</p><p>After two more resolutions, the size of the wavelet coefficients is down to 26 = 64, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 8</ref>. H2  continues to lose more energy that &amp;XI. Both wavelets, however, manage to maintain the basic pattern (four peaks) of the original function.</p><p>Although more numbers are multiplied with higher p values during decomposition, the merging process is dominated by the offset of the data during each multiplication, which shifts two positions at a time for orthogonal wavelets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">Energy loss versus resolution</head><p>Each wavelet decomposition introduces energy loss (error) into the approximation. By examining <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figures 6-8</ref>, we see that Hz has significantly larger energy loss at each resolution. However, the amount of energy loss depends not only on the wavelet itself, but also on the smoothness of the data, which may change during each resolution. This is discussed in the following section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.3">Energy loss versus data smoothness</head><p>The rate of decay of wavelet decomposition is governed by the number of vanishing moments of the wavelet. In general, as illustrated in our previous example, smooth functions like 020 approximate functions better than Hz. However, this is not always true.</p><p>We use a second sinusoid with a higher frequency to demonstrate. The discrete function size is 29 = 5 12. There are a total of 21 peaks as depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 9</ref>.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> shows the wavelet coefficients after two resolutions with 256 discrete items. Because of the smoothness of the data, the very small energy loss of 020 hardly shows The next resolution is depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>. It has 128</p><p>Figure 11: Wavelet coefficients of dataset fl2 with 128 items.</p><p>discrete wavelet coefficients: 64 approximations and 64 details. All 21 spikes stay in the approximation, which is rather non-smooth by now. Disaster hits when the size of the function reaches 26 = 64. The Nyquist limit (the lower bound to retain all the spikes) is past. As a result, features merge and large details are created. For the first time in our examples, 020 has larger details than HZ as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref>. H2 does not approximate functions accurately because it only has one vanishing moment. However, it does not tend rapidly to zero at finer levels, and the accuracy also depends on the smoothness of the function. When the function is smooth, more vanishing moments lead to smaller wavelet details. On the other hand, more vanishing moments also lead to more large wavelet details when the function is nonsmooth, so D20 is not always a better choice over HZ.</p><p>The phenomenon shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures lo-12</ref> is repeated for the rest of the resolutions. The first three resolutions of this example are marked by their inactivity or repose. Most of the major features of the approximations stay the same, i.e., the details are very small. That creates a state of quiescence.</p><p>It also, however, establishes a horizon beyond which disaster lurks. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref>, half of the spikes in the approximation are gone, and the details (the energy loss) are actually much larger than the approximations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition</head><p>In a progressive refinement environment, a quiescence is defined as a state of inactivity in which most of the distinctiveness of the refining target stays.</p><p>One of the major issues of our application <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref> is the detection of quiescence. Only the lowest resolution representation needs to be maintained from a set of resolutions that are part of a single quiescent state:</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Error tracking and results</head><p>We do not claim that our sinusoid-based examples above simulate real life scientific data. Thy are presented because they show the special characteristics of orthogonal wavelets. Now we present results of non-sinusoid functions. Since wavelet transforms are well adapted to respond locally to rapid changes in function values <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>, orthogonal wavelets are often used as edge detectors <ref type="bibr">[lo, 111</ref>. Energy loss during wavelet decomposition usually implies edge (i.e., pattern) changes of the approximations. Small changes produce little wavelet details, which can largely be ignored. Large changes such as aliasing, however, produce significant wavelet details. These details are good indicators of the quality of the wavelet approximation of each resolution.</p><p>A function with 512 discrete values is created to demonstrate the idea of using wavelet details to measure the authenticity of wavelet approximations, as described at the beginning of section 4. The function has seven special features including: 1) two discrete steps, 2) a portion of a sinusoid, 3) two steep slopes (f(z) = x3 and its mirror image), 4) a sharp spike, 5) some fluctuating signaIs, 6) a large flat block, and 7) a small block. Each of them is identified with its feature number as depicted in <ref type="figure">Figure 20</ref>. When D4 is applied to this function, it produces 256 discrete approximations followed by 256 details, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 21</ref>. In the graph, the wavelet details corresponding loss, indicating major pattern changes. Each of the following two blocks (features 6 and 7) produce two consecutive spikes, indicating the two sharp edges of the blocks. The next two resolutions are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 22 and 23</ref>.   overall approximation quality, while the maximum indicates the worst error. We notice from the graphs that D4 keeps the function pattern intact. This is largely reflected by the correlated numbers in the table.</p><p>These numbers, however, fail to show the energy loss of a particular feature such as the fluctuating signals, which produce the largest details. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">Figure 25</ref> is a summary of to the original features are marked with the same numbers. Starting from the left of the details, we see two sharp spikes which indicate the two sudden slope changes of feature 1. The energy loss is due to the fact that these two sharp edges are smoothed out. The details of feature 2 are almost invisible, reflecting the high approximation power of D4 on sinusoids. The two steep slopes of feature 3 create only small spikes, which also indicate good approximations. The isolated spike of feature 4 is preserved with some loss. The fluctuating signals of feature 5 produce the largest amount of  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Visualization of error</head><p>We briefly describe a wavelet-based multiresolution visualization system [ 191, and use it to display approximations of scientific data and its corresponding error. The system, as depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 27</ref>, supports progressive refinement data analysis with resolution as fine as one data item per pixel. Ten orthogonal wavelets with vanishing moments from p = 1 to 10 are provided. The system keeps track of the accumulated data loss as well as data loss from individual resolutions during wavelet transforms. This error can be displayed alongside the compressed data. Input data can be in CDF <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref> or system-defined binary formats. A variety of colormaps are available. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figures 27 and 28</ref> show a 1D data set extracted from the CD-ROM USA-NASADDF-ISTPXP-0003 recorded from the spacecraft GEOTAIL of the ISTP [6] project. The data set contains electron average energy data recorded every 64 seconds around the earth for the first three months of 1994. It has a total of 217 = 13 1,072 integers.</p><p>04 is used to generate a total of 7 resolutions, from the Oth resolution with 2" = 1,024 to the 6th resolution with 216 = 65,536 items. The display is a one-dimensional line plot with colors indicating the accumulated data loss (error) of each item. A rainbow colormap shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 28a</ref> is used for the display.</p><p>We start from the coarsest (Oth) resolution with 1,024 items, an approximation of the original 13 1,072 items. From Section 4.3, we know that the energy loss of a wavelet transform depends on a number of factors including the data values and the smoalthness of the data. Six features are chosen from the data, as indicated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 28b</ref>, to illustrate these ideas as well as the importance of the approximation error display.</p><p>Feature 1 contains highly fluctuating data with some of the highest data values. Both of them contribute to the very high energy loss of the approximation. This is reflected by the darker colors (green/blue) of the error display in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figures 28b and 28c.</ref>.</p><p>In terms of data values, features 4, 5 and 6 are more or less close to each other. However, when we look at the smoothness of the data, we notice that feature 6 is smoother than the other two. It implies that feature 6 has the lowest energy loss. This is accurately reflected by the color of the error displayed in Figures 28b. Both features 4 and 5 have green spikes while feature 6 is light orange.</p><p>The value of the error representation is particularly evident when looking at features 2 and 3. They have very similar values, spreads, and shapes. Feature 3, however, has more green (higher value) spikes than feature 2. These two features (marked by the dotted rectangles) are zoomed to a finer (4th) resolution, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figures 28d and  28e</ref>. This finer resolution reveals that feature 2 is indeed very smooth data, while feature 3 is relatively non-smooth. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 28e</ref> shows that feature 3 has multiple spikes spread across the area. These narrow spikes fade away during the downsampling process because the Nyquist limit (to hold all the spikes) is reached. Their errors are clearly reflected in our display. By using the color to represent accumulated error, we are able to identify areas of the coarsest resolution representation that warrant investigation at finer resolutions.</p></div>
