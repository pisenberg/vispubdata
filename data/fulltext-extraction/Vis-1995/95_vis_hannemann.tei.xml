<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Overview</head><p>This paper is written from the viewpoint of applied aerodynamics, using computational tools for various design tasks in all speed regimes of modern air transport. Software development for improving the understanding of basic fluid dynamic phenomena as well as their consequences for practical aerodynamics and configuration design includes a number of tools: I) Geometry generators for solid modelling under the aspect of providing suitable parameters which focus on efficiently varying aerodynamic performance results using CFD analysis and at the same time allow the preprocessing for CAD of experimental model and later vehicle component production; II) CFD analysis and (inverse) design codes in a mature state to allow fast computation with an acceptable accuracy, applied either in optimization cycles or in just modelling steady or unsteady flow around configuations under investigation; III) Graphic visualization tools for a rapid study of the crucial portions of Ilow and configuration, including video technology on workstations. General purpose CAD systems offer many applications for various design tasks in the development of commercial products. Their ability in applied aerodynamics, however, to allow for parametric variations emphasizing a special fluid mechanic phenomenon are still rather poor. Such phenomena are both the source of serious aerodynamic problems in critical operation conditions as well as they may offer also performance advantages if they are fully understood and supported Iby special shaping and adapting geometry details.</p><p>In an aerospace research establishment like ours, some time and efforts have been spent to investigate possibilities for designing aerodynamically efficient configurations, namely in the high speed regime of transonic, supersonic and hypersonic flow. Looking back to the past years, a typical search for new design concepts in any of these speed regimes included classical analytical modelling, guided by the gasdynamic and fluid mechanic knowledge base and accelerating numer:ical analysis (CFD) programs to become design tools. Test.ing and applying such design tools required the developme,nt of specialized graphics on workstation computers with progressively larger storage and faster computation capacity. This development process has by far not come to an end, lbut impressive results are obtained already by the aerospace industry using these interactive design tools. In the following, three topics of modern aerospace research have been chosen to illustrate some aerodynamic design problems which still may profit from improved techniques to extract crucial information from basic studies, implement it in numerical codes and visualize the gains from resulting new design concepts. The related geometry work suggested a 4D extension of the solid modelling to allow for generating whole families of 3D configurations: they provide moving boundary conditions for unsteady flow codes as well as for optimizing shapes in steady flow conditions and finally the hardware realization of optimization is the design of adaptive devices in airframe and propulsion, modeled by series of shapes simulating mechanical adaptation. Classical aerodynamics includes lifting wing theory for large aspect ratio transport airplane wings. In the speed regime of high subsonic flight Mach numbers the aerodynamic performance of lifting wings is seriously reduced ratio while observing certain geometrical constraints. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  2</ref> shows just two configurations under study, a whole series is created by the same set of parameters with only a small number of parameters being function of a "superparameter" marking a "4th dimension" -here the range of computational adaptation. Video animation of such shape variation with a series of steps between the shown edge geometries gives the impression of a metamorphosis from one to the other configuration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 1</head><p>High wing transport airplane wing-body configuration and arrangement in Gottingen Transonic Windtunnel for experiments with adaptive parts in the wing root area.</p><p>by the occurrence of shock waves, associated viscous ilow interactions and separation on the wing surface. This phenomenon posed serious problems to increase the speed of aircraft for a long time. Some years ago theoretical concepts were developed to avoid strong shocks on wings for certain operating conditions through systematic shock-free design approaches <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>. These techniques are so far limited to simple wings. With the availability of more powerful analysis codes to compute the flow past whole aircraft configurations or complete wind tunnel test arrangements ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) the extension of design methods to shape more complex geometries becomes necessary, like the surface geometry definition of a wing root integrated to the fuselage. Work under progress includes the definition of a generic high wing transport airplane with modular parts to study the influence of a series of modest to prominent fillets (wing root fairings) and local body geometry variations. The idea is gaining a maximum lift-over-drag For an experimental verification of computed flow fields a series of models would have to be built and tested. With the practical aspects of influencing real flow past aircraft in mind, a modest variation is physically realized by the construction of adaptive parts, implemented on the wind tunnel model <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref> to especially study the flow phenomena in the wing root area. The computation of transonic flow past such configurations is complicated due to CFD grid generation and time-consuming numerical analysis. Flow separation on fuselages like this airlifter configuration is strong and complex, which requires a Navier-Stokes code for CFD analysis. Preliminary results using fast but rather inaccurate codes nevertheless improve the aerodynamic knowledge base at least for wing root design before more accurate methods become practical tools with reduced computation time.</p><p>Supersonicjlow: High speed civil transport analysis Aerospace research and development has once again turned its interest to high speed (supersonic) civil transport (HSCT) after the only operational aircraft in this speed regime, the Concorde, can be called a technical success but also must be called an economical failure. In this situation research institutions see the challenge to come up with new technologies for higher fuel efficiency, less emissions and less noise, applied to new configurations. Both economical and environmental aspects will determine if such an aircraft will be built and enter service within the next 15 -25 years. Aerodynamics, aeroacoustics and structures will need Generic supersonic transport aircraft; Modelling wing deformations for aeroelastic computations.</p><p>generic configurations to test various technologies. We have, therefore, created a series of configurations [7] with the geometry generator, which may serve as test beds for a number of theoretical and computational investigations. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> shows a baseline configuration derived from a Boeing design for Mach = 2.4, the idea is to generate modifications for optimization strategies but also deformations for aeroelastic modelling: <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref> depicts bent wing tips to investigate aeroelastic loads. Moving surfaces and CFD grids, along with varying pressure fields are depicted suitably in video clips, some first results have been obtained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 4</head><p>Pressure field in a cross section generated by the wing-body configuration of a generic supersonic transport aircraft Another Iresearch goal is the investigation of noise pollution through the sonic boom of supersonic aircraft: A bow wave forms at ,the tip and from the lifting wing of such a configuration (F:ig. 4), its trace on the ground is annoying and its impulse does serious damage to buildings. Here we see a challenge to visualize various quantifications <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref> of sonic boom and sonic bang resulting from conventional and novel configurations.</p><p>Hypersonic flow: Aerospace plane propulsion integration A final example is from our work in hypersonic flow: During the palst 10 years plans for reusable vehicles for transport into orbit have been made but many problems delay a realistic project to build a flight demonstrator, many more phenomena need to be understood, numerically modelled and experimentally tested. Our understanding so far of how to obtain high aerodynamic efficiency includes some new concepts to use the whole forebody of the aircraft as an inlet for propulsion, the resulting configuration is called a "waverider" and we have recently contributed new methods [9, lo] to design such configurations, <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Conclusion and future work</head><p>In this paper some examples from high speed design aerodynamics show currently investigated problems and illustrate the high value of graphic visualization in our work environment. Especially moving surfaces and flow patterns will be better understood through video animation: presently in most cases we still create suitable color graphics images to learn about the practical value of our design work. Some case stud&amp;, however, lend themselves to become test cases also for th.e further development of visualization tools.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Generic high wing transport aircraft wing-body configurations.
