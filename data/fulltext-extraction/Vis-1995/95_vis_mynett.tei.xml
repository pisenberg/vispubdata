				<p>Many practical problems in open channel hydraulics that were traditionally investigated in hydraulic model experiments, are nowadays being solved by using computational fluid dynamics. However, in order to interpret computational results, there is a clear preference among scientist and engineersfor visualization in analogy with experimental techniques. One such technique, particle tracing, enables a dynamic (Lagrangian) interpretation of a statically (Eulerian) computed vectorfield. However, quite often the emphasis in particle tracing is only on the mean flow properties, while effects due to dispersion and mixing ure often not accounted for. Hence turbulentjow characteristics have to be incorporated in a visualization system for practical hydraulic engineering problems. The particle tracing technique presented in this case study has been specifically developed to combine both mean andjuctuating velocity vectors, thus simulating stochastic perturbations around meanjow conditions. A number of cases are presented in this paper that demonstrate the practical applicabilityof advanced visualization techniques in realistic engineering studies.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>in this respect, and considerable advances have been made in the field of numerical flow modeling. However, in all applications of CFD, the huge amount of data generated by numerical flow simulations, are usually stored as a great number of discrete -and often time-dependent -data items like Eulerian velocity vectors and turbulent flow parameters on often extensivecomputational grids. Although calculations can be performed quite rapidly using present day computer technology, it does not help the researcher or the consulting engineer very much if he has to digest and interpret all this information from printouts or vector plots of computed numbers. Their interest is primarily directed towards understanding the physical implications of the numerical simulations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Problem Statement</head><p>Environmental aspects are becoming important considerations in the design of hydraulic structures. Spreading of pollutants in rivers, lakes, estuaries and seas are of great interest, not only because of accumulation of toxic materials in ecologically sensitive areas, but even more so in case of catastrophes likeleakage of hazardous fluids horn transport tankers or pipeline bursts. Traditionally, hydraulic model experiments were used in the above mentioned situations to simulate the processes determining spreading and mixing of fluids. However, the effort associated with setting up scale models, calibrating them, and then performing a great number of experiments for all relevant parameter combinations, requires considerable time and costs. Hence alternative methods have been developed to speed up investigation time and reduce costs. This is where scientific visualization has given considerable impetus to the field of computational fluid dynamics. Initially the emphasis in flow visualization was either on aerodynamic applications of external flows around airfoils and spacecraft, or on internal pipe flows for industrial processes. However, visualization techniques have also been developed for applications of CFD in free surface flows as encountered in rivers, canals, estuaries and seas, commonly referred to as computational hydraulics. Most flow visualization techniques have been developed in analogy with experimental techniques used in hydraulic scale models, so as to interpret the outcome of numerical computations in terms of the same underlying physical phenomena. The cases presented in this paper demonstrate this analogy between numerical and experimental simulations using particles and coloured dye as tracer elements. Both applications incorporate and explicitly show the effect of turbulence on spreading and mixing in realistic configurations like natural bays or manmade harbour inlets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational fluid dynamics has greatly contributed</head><p>In general, the hydraulic design process can be characterized by the following stages: l establishing initial configuration l performing computational or experimental simulation l interpreting the resulting flow pattern 0 modifying configuration l etc. <ref type="bibr">Upson [l]</ref> refers to this process as the computational cycle. Although in principle this process is straightforward and well-defined, there are quite a number of difficulties that are encountered on the way. Moreover, these difficulties often are case-dependent, as described below. One particular case considered in this paper was the spreading of the outflow of the river Vistula in the Bay of Gdafisk, Poland. Due to the tidal motion, circulation patterns are induced inside the bay area. Numerical simulations and scientific visualization techniques were used to detect the circulation pattern. Yet another case was the hydraulic design of a harbour entrance near Lith in the river Meuse in The Netherlands . In order to eliminate siltation and associated dredging of the harbour entrance due to deposition of river sediment, the geometry of the harbour was to be designed in such a way that the overall flow in the river was guided smoothly past the entrance. Flow visualization techniques were used both in experimental and numerical simulations to optimize the design of the harbour layout.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Case Study Applications</head><p>In order to be able to compare computational results with experimental simulations using coloured dye, particle tracing techniques were used. When doing so, the following aspects have to be dealt with: l How to visualize the effect of turbulence? Most of the visualization packages for computational fluid dynamics present the computational results in terms of separate (vector) fields for mean velocity and (scalar) fields for turbulence intensity. Some packages allow particle tracing to display the mean flow pattern, but none of the known visualization systems are capable of combining vector and scalar fields to display flow characteristics caused by turbulence. These features, however, are essential in studies related to dispersion and mixing processes caused by e.g. river outflow in a bay or circulation near a harbour entrance. Hence, in order to study these mixing processes in hydraulic engineering practice, visualization of the combined vector and scalar fields is necessary. These techniques have recently been developed in a joint research project between Delft University and Delft Hydraulics, as described by <ref type="bibr">Hin [2]</ref>. The methodology is based on particle tracing. This implies that a Lagrangian representation is derived from the Eulerian computational data. Effects of turbulence are simulated in the visualization technique by using not only mean but 'also fluctuating velocity components. Therefore random velocity fluctuations are added to the mean particle motion, in accordance with the correct turbulence intensities computed for the flow field. Of course accurate particle tracing methods are required, in particular for complicated 3D curvilinear grids which often occur in computational geometries related to engineering practice, as indicated by Sadarjoen [33.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the location of the particles originating from an intermittent particle source in the mouth of the Vis-tulaRiver. The circulation pattern in the bay can clearly be observed and interpreted. An alternative way of visualizing the flow pattern in the bay is presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, where a volume method has been used to show the concentration of partic.les in a number of control volumes. This latter technique is particularly useful to investigate the spreading and mixing of dissolved substances which is often subject of interest in environmental studies. b How to determine the number of particles, starting point, and type of injection? These are all important parameters that may influence the visual effect considerably. For example, if an instantaneous source of particles is used, viz. particles are released at one particular instant of time, dispersion of the flow field will lead to a change in spatial concentration during the time of simulation. On the other hand, if a continuous source of particles is used, the effect of dispersion becomes less pronounced but the overall structure of the flow field becomes better visible. One way to overcome these difficulties and combine the strong points of both methods is to use an intermittent source: continuous release of particles during limited time intervals. The effect of dispersion can clearly be made visible in this way, while the overall flow dynamics are adequately presented as well. Several dynamic examples and types of particle sources will be displayed from video at the conference; some static images are incorporated in this paper (see colour plates as well). ulations? In the case study for Lith harbour, a comparison was made between numerical simulations and hydraulic scale model experiments. Video recordings were available from the experimental set-up, containing a number of runs using coloured dye injection for different harbour geometries. Detailed investigatons of the spatial structure of the computed flow pattern were carried out dynamically by zooming and circulating around areas of interest. In the video presentation and in the Figures in this paper, the viewing angle for the numerical simulations was chosen in accordance with the hydraulic model study. Aspects of how to achieve feature detection from vector quantities in numerically simulated flow fields in combination with experimental flow visualization are described by <ref type="bibr">Pagendarm and Walter [4]</ref>.  <ref type="figure">Figure.</ref> The main river is situated on the upper i&amp;t part, and the overall flow direction is from top to bottom. Lith harbour is located at the bottom part, separated from the main river channel by a guiding barrier. The harbour entrance and the connection wih the main river is in the upper center part of the <ref type="figure">Figure.</ref> The mean flow pattern can be inferred from the white particles near the harbour entrance (see also colour plates). In stationary flow conditions these mean particle paths can be interpreted as dividing streamlines between the main river flow and the relatively stagnant harbour basin. However, due to turbulence there is exchange of flow across these dividing streamlines, as indicated by the green particles in the <ref type="figure">Figure.</ref> It can clearly be observed from the length of the particle paths, that the tlow velocity in the main river by far exceeds the circulation speed inside the harbour. This implies that dissolved matter, suspended sedimen or toxic substances that are transported with the river flow, are much longer detainde inside the harbour than in the main river channel. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> shows the turbulent particle paths originating from a continuous injection source upstream. From these paths the effects of dispersion in the main river channel and circulation inside the harbour can be inferred. Also, the proportion of a possible source of pollution entering the harbour as well as the residence time of pollutants inside, can be estimated from the relative density of particle paths, as presented in the <ref type="figure">Figure.</ref> Although considerable improvement has already been made by using scientific visualization in combination with numerical computation, the approach followed here is still 'traditional' in the sense that it very much follows a 'sequential' approach. First the schematization is carried out, then the computations are performed and then the results are visually displayed and interpreted. If this leads to modifications in the original design, a new schematization is carried out, new computations are performed and the new results are visually displayed and interpreted.</p><p>This process could again be improved and accelerated, if the computations could be visually monitored, interpreted &lt;and perhaps modified or abandoned if the modifications were not leading to the required improvement. This process is generally referred to as computational steering as outlined bij Van <ref type="bibr">Wijk and Van Liere [6]</ref>. Even further, if criteria could be established that quantitatively could asses the computational results, adaptive algorithms could be developed that 'automatically' change the hydraulic design and converge to optimal engineering solutions.</p><p>Of course, visual comparison of experimental and numerical simulations has already been a subject of further study in many fields of science and engineering. To compare at image level, a point of view in the hydraulic model similar to the one in the computed visualizationis required, as pointed out by <ref type="bibr">Pagendarm and Post [5]</ref>. They also outline such clear and distinctive relations with present and future developments in image processing, that interesting results are to be expected in the very near future. The same holds for computer vision related tofeature extraction from three-dimensional images.</p><p>However, before these techniques can be applied in engineering practice, considerable effort has to be spent by hydraulic engineers, numerical analysts and computer scientists alike, in a joint effort to advance the fields of computational hydraulics and scientific flow visualization.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Bay of Gdahsk: mean and fluctuating particles</figDesc></figure>
