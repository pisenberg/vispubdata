			<abstract>
				<p>This paper reports on the development of a strategy to generate databases used for real-time interactive landscape visualization. The database construction from real world data is intended to be as automated as possible. The primary sources of information are remote sensing imagery recorded by Landsat&apos;s Thematic Mapper (TM) and digital elevation models (DEM). Additional a&amp;sets (trafJic networks and buildings) are added to extend the database. In a first step the TM images are geocoded and then segmented into areas of different land coverage. During the visual simulation highly detailed photo textures are applied onto the terrain based on the classification results to increase the apparent amount of detail. The data processing and integration is carried out using custom image processing and geographic information systems (GIS) software. Finally, a sample visual simulation application is implemented. Emphasis is put on practical implementation to test the feasibility of the approach as a whole.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>There is a growing demand for high quality interactive visual simulations in the field of landscape visualization. This work is motivated by three problems:</p><p>l <ref type="bibr">Graf et al. [4]</ref> have presented strikingly realistic landscape visualization. They use texture mapping with satellite imagery and aerial photographs. For practical and economic reasons however high resolution aerial photographs are usually only available for limited areas. With no such high resolution data at hand the visualization is of low quality in the foreground if the observer position is located near the terrain surface (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). The generation of terrain databases is often a time consuming and therefore an expensive process. It includes data capture and modelling. Modelling and editing by hand, even with advanced tools, takes a lot of time 191. Interactive visual simulation requires an update rate of several frames per second. The number of polygons for complex terrain visualization often exceeds the capacity of graphics workstations.</p><p>Consequently we define three objectives: l Increased realism of the visualization for observer positions near the terrain surface. l Efficient database generation with little or no interactive editing. . Reduction of the number of polygons to be rendered with little loss of apparent realism.</p><p>A further requirement is that we want to use custom GIS and image processing software for the data capture and integration instead of traditional visual simulation database modellers. In addition, the database must cover extended areas of a real geographical space (not some artificial scene).</p><p>To reach the first goal we propose the mapping of characteristic photo textures onto the terrain surface. The landuse information is extracted from remote sensing imagery. Such data allow quick data capture for large areas. However, the spatial resolution of satellite images is limited. Using GIS allows minimization of interactive editing and modelling required. Automated spatial analysis and modelling features of GIS will be used instead.</p><p>(See color plates, page CP-12) Data capture by remote sensing and data modelling by To represent buildings we proceed rather unconven-GIS fulfils our second goal. To reduce the number of poly-tionally. The Swiss Federal Statistical Office captures data gons to be rendered (third goal) we construct different Zev-on residential buildings simultaneously with the decennial els-of-detail (LOD), a number of progressively simpler census. In accordance with the federal laws on right to priversions of the terrain which are switched at simulation vacy we received the following parameters for more than time as a. function of range.</p><p>45,000 buildings in our test area: X/Y coordinates, type of <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Landscape visualization using texture mapping of satellite imagery.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Data description</head><p>For our research project we chose a test site in Central Switzerland covering an area of 30km x 24km.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">TM image data and elevation data</head><p>Landsat TM satellite data are our primary source of landuse information. TM collects image data with a relative coarse spatial resolution (30m) but allows the coverage of extended areas. The TM swath width is 185km. Data are gathered in seven spectral bands which extend from the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum to building (5 categories) and number of floors.</p><p>3 Image processing and classification</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Geocoding</head><p>In order to use satellite images as a data source for visual simulation, they must refer to the same geometric reference system as the DEM and the auxiliary data. Therefore, the image which was used for this work had to be geocoded. Although a satellite image provides a maplike view of the Earth's surface, it differs fundamentally in geometric terms from a map. There are many geometric distortions within satellite image data, and they can have severe effects. The errors can be related to three sources: the satellite (platform) motion and Earth rotation, the imaging geometry of the sensor, and the terrain variations in the scene. The errors induced by the platform and by the sensor have been system corrected by the data receiving facilities. In addition, satellite images are affected with a scene induced image displacement due to terrain height variations. This displacement can amount to several pixels <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. Tbe applied geocoding algorithm consists of a modified polynomial transformation which uses in addition a DEM in order to take into account the relief displacement. Even in alpine areas where elevation differences up to 3000 meters are quite typical, the accuracy is good. Independent tie-point sets showed mean deviations of about half a pixel size. the thermal infrared. The digital elevation model 'DHM 25' used in this 3.2 Classification work was derived by the Swiss Federal Office of Topography from digitized topographic Maps of the scale 1:25,OOO. This DEM is commercially available to the user as a raster model with 25m pixel spacing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Traffic network and buildings</head><p>During the classification steps entities of interest are extracted from the TM image. Based on its spectral characteristics every pixel is labelled as representing a particular ground cover type or class. Every class can then be rendered using its appropriate graphics attributes. Classification of multispectral images is a wide spread and well known topic in remote sensing (for a detailed description see <ref type="bibr">[ 111)</ref>. Irrespective of the particular method chosen, the essential practical steps for a supervised cZussi$cation are [ll]:</p><p>It is usually impossible to extract features from remote sensing data equal to or smaller than the resolution of the sensor. Since TM images supply relatively coarse spatial information a classification will lack important features such as roads and buildings. To extend the terrain database other available datasets, such as road networks and buildings, should be added. In accordance with our aim of efficient database production, we use an existing traffic network dataset digitized from large scale maps. 1) Determine the set of landcover classes into which the image is to be segmented. 2) Select representative pixels from each of the desired set of classes (so called training sets).</p><p>3) Use the training sets to estimate the parameters of the particular classifier algorithm to be used. 4) Classify every pixel in the image.</p><p>The choice of landcover classes for step 1 must be based on the separability in the satellite image and the requirements of the visual simulation.</p><p>We use the six of the seven TM bands, discarding the thermal one, for the classification and apply the maximum likelihood algorithm for steps 3 and 4. This type of classification is supported in most commercial image processing systems used in remote sensing. The result is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. For a qualitative validation of the result we digitally overlay the classification on a topographic map. Based on visual judgment the result is reasonable. Quantitative statements can not be given here since we lack observations made on the ground that can be used to verify the interpretation of the image. 4 Data integration and modelling using GIS Because GIS allows the management, modelling, analysis, and presentation of spatial data it is an attractive alternative to traditional modellers specialized for visual simulation databases. The datasets described in section 2 are fused and modelled using GIS. Thus, the steps described in this section use built-in GIS functionalities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Raster to vector conversion</head><p>Both the classified image data and the DEM are stored as regular square gria!s (RSG). RSGs are easy to manage but often either redundant or lacking information, or, even worse, redundant in some areas of the RSG while lacking information in others. To realize a simulation with an update rate of several frames per second we must reduce the number of polygons in the database substantially. Triangulated irregular networks (TIN) are more appropriate for this task since the sampling density can be adapted to tbe terrain roughness or the landcover parceling. Therefore we transform the raster data into vector form for the subsequent processing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Level of detail generation</head><p>Level-of-detail (JOD) management is one of the most beneficial tools available to improve display performance of a visual simulation application. The basic premise is that, due to perspective foreshortening, objects distant from the observer do not need to be rendered with much detail. The LOD approach is to construct a number of progressively less detailed versions of complex objects. During simulation the different versions are switched most often as a simple function of range, field of view, and the size of the displayed image in pixels. Sometimes more advanced functions including additional parameters such as motion speed, focus of attention and system load are</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">used [6].</formula><p>Classi6ed image data. Two types of simplification can be applied to the classified image data that represents the ground coverage: l geometric simplification l union of visually similar classes Geometric simplification is achieved by using less vertices to represent the boundaries between different landuse patches and by eliminating polygons with small areas. In addition, visually similar classes can be assembled for a coarser LOD. Combining the two criteria it becomes clear that neighbouring small polygons that belong to visually similar classes should be reduced first, while large polygons that contrast much with their surroundings should be maintained even in the coarsest LOD (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3</ref>).  Geometric simplification of lines (representing boundaries between different landuse patches) can be obtained by the Douglas-Peuker algorithm [ 11. The algorithm weeds coordinates within a line. Trend lines are created frorn the line's starting point to other vertices in the line, and the weed tolerance is used to identify and remove vertices which fall within the tolerance of the trend line.</p><p>In our work we generated three LOD using simplification parameters based on subjective visual judgment (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). Advanced generalization based on perceptibility is the subject of ongoing research. Roads and railroads are Taking into account a mean error of the 'DHM 25' of 2-5m (depending on surface roughness) it can be seen that the relatively narrow-spaced raster DEM (25m) contains much redundancy. We define the maximum tolerable z error to be: lOm, 25m and 1OOm for our three LOD. The corresponding TIN-versions of the DEM are used. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">tiaffic network</head><p>The incorporation of the vector traffic network data was performed in three steps:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Buffering 2) Polygon overlay 3) TIN modification by breaklines</head><p>The generation of buffer zones around features is an operation commonly used in GIS. Buffering creates one or more polygons around geographic features and is used to determine spatial proximity. We use buffers to create (rail)roads with well-defined widths from our vector data. The resulting polygons are then overlaid on the landuse polygons (see <ref type="figure">Figure 7)</ref>.</p><p>Of course the construction of (rail)roads affects the original terrain shape. A road running along a slope should not be tilted laterally <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>. Since the DEM does not consider such effects we use the road buffers as breaklines to modify the TIN. Breaklines are linear features used in GIS to define and control interruptions in surface smoothness. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 12</ref> shows a piece of the modified TIN integrated with a railroad and a highway running along a mountain slope. Lakes are treated in a similar manner to ensure, that all locations within the lake and along the shore line have the same z value. The lake shore also represents an abrupt change in surface smoothness. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Buildings</head><p>Since only a few statistical parameters are available (section 2.2), we must make plausible assumptions to define and render the buildings while minimizing stereo typing. We estimate the length, width, height and orientation of the buildings and compute the z values by intersection with the TIN surface. The starting point for the estimation of the building's dimensions is the number of floors. We define the height of one floor to be 3 meters. Making additional assumptions on the living area of an apartment and on the number of apartments per floor we can guess the length and width of each building. The roofs are assumed to be flat for houses with more than 4 floors. Otherwise, they are gabled. The orientation of the buildings is calculated using the TIN surface so that the buildings are aligned to the contour lines of the terrain. Moreover, buildings that intersect roads are moved aside.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Integration of elevation and landuse data</head><p>Next we combine the landuse polygons with the elevation data from the TIN. This step is performed for each LOD using the appropriate version of the elevation and landuse data. First we compute the z value for every vertex of each landuse polygon by intersection with the surface of the original raster DEM. This assures precise z values for each vertex. Using only these vertices, the terrain shape would already be described quite precisely for a LOD that consists of many small landuse polygons. However, as the LOD-dependent elevation error must not be exceeded at any location within our database we supply additional vertices from the appropriate elevation-TIN (lOm, 25m or 1OOm version). These extra vertices provide shape geometry only and do not contribute any landuse information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6">Generation of tiles</head><p>In order to construct an efficient database partitioning becomes important. Subdivision is a prerequisite for the LOD management, efficient paging (loading from disk to PAM), and efficient culling during the visual simulation. Culling determines whether an object that might be a part of the terrain is inside the viewing frustum and decides if it should be drawn.</p><p>There are two basic schemes to partition the database <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>. The first is location based. As a result, objects that are close together belong to the same segment. The second strategy is based on the type of the objects. In this scheme, all the objects of the same type are grouped together. The location-based subdivision method is efficient in terms of location-based queries but inefficient for type-based queries. The object type scheme is the reverse. Since most queries for the rendering process are location based, i.e. "render all objects in the viewing frustum", we chose the location-based approach.</p><p>A good technique is to divide the database into squares called tiles. In GIS such partitions evolved originally from the concept of map sheets in cartography. The most important benefit to our application is that spatial fit is assured. After the tiles have been generated, the whole database is triangulated because our application renders triangles most efficiently.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">A visual simulation sample application</head><p>To show the usefulness of our approach we implemented a visual simulation application based on Silicon Graphics' IRIS Performer toolkit [ 121. IRIS Performer is designed to provide a software development environment that delivers maximum possible performance from the graphics workstation. Tbe toolkit offers important features to the application developer such as: To transfer the data between the GIS and the Performer-based application we export the GIS database to an interchange format which is then imported. The design of the interchange format allows efficient database paging at simulation time by tiling. A hierarchical subdivision based on object type is added to every tile, resulting in a combined location/object based subdivision of the database. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Texture mapping</head><p>To meet the requirements for realism and detail in landscape visualization the application of textures is essential. We distinguish two types of textures: geo-specific textures and geo-typical textures. The term geo-specific textures [lo] is used for icons of a part of the Earth's surface, i.e. satellite images and aerial photographs. These icons are usually large images, recorded directly by a sensor. 111 contrast, the designation geo-typical textures describes small photo patches representative for some type of landcover.</p><p>Texture adds realism to objects at little computing cost when running the visual simulation on a workstation that supports texture mapping in hardware. Nevertheless, texture memory is still very expensive and limited in size. Consequently, to build visual simulation applications that use huge geo-specific textures of hundreds of MBytes at low or medium cost requires a paging mechanism that moves textures in and out of texture memory. This may result in a significant loss of performance.</p><p>Tlhe use of geo-typical textures can meet both requirements,, realism and detail as well as real-time interactive performance, on general purpose graphics workstations that support hardware texture mapping. We map such textures onto the terrain based on the landcover information of the classified TM image. A library of geo-typical textures was compiled partly from appropriate public domain data and partly from local photographs where a Swiss look was required. Of course it is possible to apply different textures to the same landuse class, for example if the terrain is rendered for different seasons.</p><p>Certainly, we do not claim the same fidelity of terrain representation that can be achieved by geo-specific textures [4], but the cost-benefit ratio of the geo-typical approach is indeed considerable. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figures 10 and 11</ref> give <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref> shows the city of Lucerne from about 600m above ground level and at a distance of about 1Okm. The left view is generated using a Landsat TM satellite image as geo-specific texture. At the right side is the same scenery but this time rendered using the database described in this paper, applying geo-typical textures.</p><p>The observer position in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 11</ref> is much closer to the ground. The scene on the left uses an aerial orthophoto as geo-specific texture. The spatial resolution of the ortho-photo is approximately lm. The right side shows the corresponding geo-typical version. Since there was no data on buildings available for this particular area no 3-D houses appear in the image. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 9</ref> the amount of data needed to render the two views is compared. A reduction factor in size of about 70 is achieved by geo-typical rendering.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Visual examples</head><p>The examples described below are snapshots recorded during a session of our visual simulation application. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 12</ref> illustrates the rendering of forests. In general, the height of trees is not reflected in DEMs. If the elevation data are used without alternation, regions which should be hidden by forests will be visible. This problem becomes serious when the observer position is close to ground level <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>. A constant value is therefore added to the z-coordinate of all polygons of the class 'forest'. Perpendicular quads are generated at the forest fringe. By apply-ing partially transparent texture maps the fringe appears very detailed although it is made up only of a few polygons. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 12</ref> also shows different types of traffic routes. The divided 4 lane highway 'N4' is rendered including the partition hedge.</p><p>Several types of buildings are drawn in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref>. Residential buildings are located in the foreground. The commercial and administrative district along the major road in the background can be recognized clearly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions and outlook</head><p>The goals defined in section 1 could be achieved. The visual simulation for observer positions near the terrain surface is distinctly improved by geo-typical textures. Compared to simulations that use satellite images as geospecific textures, the amount of apparent detail and realism is greatly increased.</p><p>Data capture using satellite images reveals itself to be efficient for large areas. However, it should not be expected that it would be possible to extract objects from data equal to or smaller than the spatial resolution of the sensor. Therefore additional datasets (traffic networks and buildings) should be added to extend the database. Unfortunately these additional datasets must be generated in a conventional manner, unless existing ones can be used. The database generation process requires only minimal interactive user intervention. The only steps that must be carried out interactively are: l The search for ground control points used for the geocoding of the satellite images. l The definition of training areas for the classification. GIS, even though not designed for this special application, has proven to be an alternative to conventional modellers. LOD are generated automatically to reduce of the number of polygons to be rendered at simulation time. The images created by our sample application are astonishingly rich in detail.</p><p>The LOD are presently based on subjective visual judgment. We plan to focus on advanced generalization based on perceptibility in the future. </p></div>
