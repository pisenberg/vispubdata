				<p>As part of a large eflort evaluating the eflect of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, we are using the spatial selection features of an object-relational database management system to support the visualization of the ecological data. The eflort, called the Sound Ecosystem Assessment project (SEA), is collecting and analyzing oceanographic and biological data from Prince William Sound in Alaska. To support visualization of the SEA data we are building a data management system which includes a spatial index over a bounding polygon for all of the datasets which are collected. In addition to other selection criteria the prototype provides several methods for selecting data within an arbitrary region. This case study presents the requirements and the implementation for the application prototype which combines visualization and database technology. The spatial indexing features of the Illustratm object-relational database management system are linked with the visualization capabilities of AVS to create an interactive environment for analysis of SEA data.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>As the quantity and disparity of scientific data increases so do the problems of managing these data. Part of the management goal is to provide consistent methods of access to scientific data which are collected with different techniques for different purposes. Scientific visualization and scientific database technology have both been used to address the problem of managing large numbers of datasets [6., 31. Meta-databases have been used to index scientific datasets and the problems of combining database technology and visualization techniques are being explored as well <ref type="bibr">[l, 51.</ref> This case study describes the use of the spatial selection capabilities of an object-relational database management system to support queries from a visualization tool. The prototype displays and manipulates scientific data which are being used to analyze biological activity after the Exxon Valdez Oil spill.</p><p>In 1994, a 5-year effort called the Sound, Alaska (PWS). A s a response to the low production of pink salmon and Pacific herring in the last few years, the SEA project is collecting a wide range of oceanographic and biological data. These data will be used to analyze the ecosystem of the Sound and provide the foundation for simulating sound-wide processes. The project is funded by the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council and includes 13 separate research groups, each of which is specializing in some aspect of the ecosystem <ref type="bibr">[a]</ref>. These aspects include the oceanography, plankton, fish, and birds in and around the Sound. Each group is collecting data relevant to its own focus and one group is charged with archiving these data and providing an integrated view of that archive to all groups in SEA. As part of this integration effort we are implementing the data management architecture as well as several visualization tools which take advantage of the spatial capabilities of a database management system. Our approach to integrating these data includes the use of both visualization and database management techniques. We have built a prototype of our visualization tools which utilizes the Illustratm [4] database management system. The spatial access methods provided by Illustra become a valuable element in the iterative set of operations for refining the selection criteria within a query and manipulating the results. This case study describes the use of irregular polygons to interactively define regions of interest for selecting datasets collected by SEA. We describe some of the datasets, and then present the motivation for the visualization tools. This is followed by a discussion of how Illustra is being used to implement spatial searches within our visualization tools.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The Challenge of SEA Data</head><p>SEA is collecting 12 main datasets, each of which has from 3 to 10 measured variables. These datasets are of different sampling geometries and ranks, different resolution in both time and space, and several different levels of interpretation.</p><p>These data are collected by scientists in different disciplines with occasionally divergent requirements. Each discipline, however, will (See color plates, page CP-53) need access to most of data, in a format which is suitable to the specific needs of the analysis. Although the total volume of data is not unmanageable, the number and disparity of the datasets presents a data management challenge.</p><p>The oceanographic data include remotely-sensed sea surface temperature, Doppler profiles of ocean currents, and vertically and horizontally sampled temperature and salinity. The biological data record phytoplankton and ocean nutrients, zooplankton, herring spawn, salmon fry, adult salmon, herring and walleye pollock, and sea birds.</p><p>The number, biomass, or feeding behavior are documented for many of the species. These oceanographic and biological data will be augmented with weather data, hydrologic data and tide information which is available from sources outside of SEA. Finally, these data will be analyzed in the context of the bathymetry (water depth) of Prince William Sound.</p><p>The level of interpretation of the data will also vary depending on the source instrument or modeling application.</p><p>S im pl e values like temperature can be recorded with little or no interpretation.</p><p>However, acoustic soundings of fish population will require several steps of manual interpretation to produce species counts and biomass. At the highest level of interpretation, simulation models using all relevant data will generate large volumes of 3-and 4-dimensional (space and time) output.</p><p>The sampling strategies result in multiple resolutions and geometries. The resolution, or size, of the sample cell varies across each sensing instrument, bottle or net used for collection. The smallest cells are less than a cubic meter and the largest can span hundreds of meters. The sampling geometries may be linear, or planer in 3-dimensional space, or include 3-and 4-dimensional output generated by the models. The geometries may be regular, irregular or scattered. These data will be used to test several hypotheses about the processes which regulate the population of pink salmon and Pacific herring in PWS. The processes include loss of herring eggs, salmon and herring feeding behavior and predators, the magnitude and direction of the current in the Sound and the overwinter behavior of the herring. Testing these hypothesis requires correlating many of the variables across both time and space. To facilitate this, the collection of the variables is coordinated between all groups to provide simultaneous measurements.</p><p>Standard locations in the Sound are revisited and the variables are re-measured to allow time series analysis as well.</p><p>As an example, understanding the movement and growth of the juvenile fish requires an understanding physical variables such as current, water temperature, the availability of food, and presence of predators. The interaction between these may depend upon the depth, proximity to the shore, and the season. Each scientist will need to correlate a different group of these variables, within given regions, across time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Visualization Tools</head><p>In order to provide a visual integration of the disparate datasets within SEA we are creating several tools for selecting and displaying SEA data. The tools use AVS a,s a visualization engine and allow the selection of data from Illustra and from files which use the HDF standard. Our prototype of these tools includes a set of it#erative operations for displaying data in a spatial co:ntext as well as in a graph form. The requirements of the interactive visualization tools are driven by the following goals: l Provide an integrated view of the datasets in SEA in order to support multidisciplinary data analysis and planning for future data collection. The data flow architecture of AVS allows iterative cycles of user interaction to be implemented with an upstream flow of data to selected modules. Selecting a geometric object can result in an alternate display of the data or the use of that object to refine the definition of a query. The network can operate as a browse tool or it can assist in more detailed analysis.</p><p>For an integrated view we created special subnetworks for each type of dataset with default visuals and a common projection.</p><p>Alternate visuals were added to allow for detailed views of each dataset. The integrated view provides a perspective on the sampling coverage of each type of dataset in the sound. It also provides the basis for our ability to browse and investigate data in finer detail.</p><p>The tools provide several ways to define the regions of interest in space and time by specifying queries visually. A user defined region of interest can be drawn on the geometry viewer. The resulting polygon is used in the selection criteria when the datasets are retrieved. A second method uses a bounding polygon around a selected dataset, or group of datasets, to define a proximity query. These polygons can be entered by the user or generated automatically using the bounds of the selected data. A third approach generates a polygon based on the values of other datasets. Isolines of temperature, salinity, or depth could be used to create a set of polygons used in the selection process. These three types of spatial queries are described more fully later and shown in <ref type="figure">Figures 2 through 4</ref>. Finally, polygons may also be predefined around study areas in which research is being concentrated.</p><p>In order to support these types of queries, as well as other types of non-spatial queries, we are implementing a data management architecture which includes an archive of HDF files and a database of meta-data. The database uses Illustra to store meta-data along with other spatial objects including the predefined polygons around study areas. To allow transportability the variables are stored in HDF files. These variables will also be cached in the database in order to answer content based queries.</p><p>We chose the Illustra database management system because it includes features of both objectoriented and relational database management systems (DBMSs).</p><p>Like a relational DBMS the data is organized into tables, views and indexes. Illustra is a commercial database management system which includes a database kernel with a standard set of data types and functions. Illustra is also extensible, allowing the user to create new data types and the functions which operate on those types. Several additional packages, called 'datablades', are available for Illustra, which include a set of types and functions which are tailored to a particular type of application.</p><p>Illustra's two dimensional spatial datablade provides a suite of spatial functions and types, including a polygon type. In addition, this datablade provides an rtree index over a subset of the spatial data types. Our meta-database includes a table of datasets with a record for each dataset in the archive. One of the attributes in this table is a 2D polygon which describes the bounds of each dataset in latitude and longitude. An rtree is used to index the set of polygons in the table. A spatial query supplies another polygon which circumscribes the region of interest and the result of the query is a list of datasets from the table which fall within that polygon.</p><p>Figures 1 through 4 are images from our prototype application. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> displays a subset of the SEA datasets over the bathymetry of Prince William Sound. The depth of the ocean floor is exaggerated and all of the topography above sea level has been flattened.</p><p>The view is looking North East from the gulf of Alaska. The port of Valdez is in the top right hand corner.</p><p>Several of the datasets have been lettered in <ref type="figure">Figure  1</ref>. The wavy lines behind the letter A display oceanographic data which is collected with an aquashuttle which moves up and down in the water column as it is towed behind a ship. Acoustic transects of the fish populations appear as blue an green curtain near the letter B. These data represent the ethos of objects in the water as the sonar instrument is moved along the surface. The vertical columns display the salinity from the surface to depth. These are called CTD casts and include temperature and oxygen measurements.</p><p>Finally, the line near the letter D, is the path of an aerial survey (video) of birds and other visible effects like rip tides. The other three figures show different methods of using a polygon to select SEA datasets. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows a polygon which has been drawn by a user around a local area of interest. This is done to reduce the retrieval time and get a general view of the data collected for a region. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> displays the selection criteria for a more detailed analysis. Polygons, defined in close proximity to 3 acoustic transects, are used to select oceanographic data which may be correlated with the acoustic data. These polygons could be automatically generated by selecting the transect from the geometry viewer. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows CTD casts within a polygon which was created from a depth contour.</p><p>Such an isoline could connect points of equal temperature or salinity rather than points of equal depth. This figure also shows a graph of temperature vs. salinity for a single CTD cast which has been inverted in the display. This type of alternate display provides additional analytic capability from within the visualization application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>By combining advanced visualization techniques and database management, our prototype provides a framework for integrating a disparate set of data. The user can visualize the data and specify spatial queries on the display, which then refine the query selection. Our work with the prototype is being followed by a full scale implementation of the data management architecture and several other visualization tools. This will test the scalability of the design with larger volumes of data.  <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>: A set of three polygons are used to query Sound displaying 4 types of datasets: A) aquashuttle within a close proximity of selected transects.
