<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>A large body of research over a number of years into applications such as hypermedia systems has shown that navigation through large electronic information systems can be a difficult task. More recent experiences with virtual reality suggest that users will also suffer from the commonly experienced "lost in hyperspace" problem when trying to navigate virtnal environments.</p><p>Thii paper will propose and demonstrate a technique which is currently under development with the aim of overcoming this problem. Our approach is based upon the concept of legibility, adapted from the discipline of city planning. The legibility of an urban environment refers to the ease with which its inhabitants can develop a cognitive map over a period of thne and so orientate themselves within it and navigate through it [81. Research into thii topic since the 1960s has argued that, by carefully designing key features of urban environments planners can signiticantly influence their legibility.</p><p>We propose that these legibility features might be adapted and applied to the &amp;sign of information visualisations and that, when combined with other navigational aids such as the trails, tours and signposts of the hyper-media world, might greatly enhance people's ability to navigate them. In particular, the primary role of legibility would be to help users to navigate mom easily as a result of repeatedly experiencing a world over a period of time (hence the idea of gradually building a cognitive map). Thus, we would see our technique being of most benefit when applied to long term, persistent and slowly evolving visualisations. Furthermore, we are particularly interested in the automatic application of legibility techniques. A typical future application of this work might be in enhancing visualisations of large information systems such the World Wide Web. Section 2 of this paper summa&amp;s the concept of legibility as used in the domain of city planning and introduces some of the key features that have been adapted and applied in our work. Section 3 introduces the concept of legibility for information visualisation. In section 4 we describe the set of algorithms and techniques which have been developed for the automatic creation or enhancement of legibility features within information visualisations. Next, section 5 demonstrates application of our algorithms to an existing 3-D graph drawing tool called FDP-Grapher which provides an overview or map of a set of inter-linked WWW pages. Finally, section 6 presents some initial reflections on this work and discusses the next steps in its evolution and evaluation.</p><p>(See color plates, page CP-24)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Legibility</head><p>Legibility, in the context of urban environments, is a term which has been used for many years in the discipline of City Planning. Work in this area has focused on the ease with which people are able to learn the layout of a city and then use this knowledge to perform wayEnding tasks. In his book "The Image of the City" [8] Kevin Lynch defines the legibility of a city as: ". . .the ease with which its parts may be recognised and can be organised into a coherent pattern.. ." Here, Lynch is referring to the formation of a cognitive map within the persons mind 191, a structure which is an internal representation of an environment which its hihabitants use as a reference when navigating to a destination. Cognitive maps fall into two types. Linear or sequential maps are based on movement through the space and what is observed on the journey. Spatial maps do not require this movement through the imagined space. A persons cognitive map may change over time. Typically, when we are new to an area our cognitive map will be linear but for some people this will evolve to become spatial over time, while for others it will remain linear. Also, active exploration of an environment, as opposed to being guided thought it, encourages the formation of richer maps which are more likely to be Spthl.</p><p>The Image of the City describes experiments carried out in a number of major US cities which show how the cognitive map is built up over time through experience of the city. The experiments involved obtaining information from long term inhabitants of the cities in the form of, for example, interviews, written descriptions of journeys through the city and drawn maps. By examining this data Lynch identified Eve major elements of urban landscapes which are identified by the inhabitants and used as the main building blocks of their cognitive maps. These features are: Static and recognisable objects which can be used to give a sense of location and bearing. Examples of landmarks might be prominent buildings or monuments or, on a smaller scale, recognisable shopfronts or roadside installations. l Districts. Sections of the environment which have a distinct character which provides coherence, allowing the whole to be viewed as a single entity. Districts may be identifiable, for example, by the nature of the architecture of the buildings in the area or by their use.  Nodes. Important points of interest along paths, e.g. road junctions or town squares. It is important to note the strong link between paths and nodes. l Edges. Structures or features providing borders to districts or linear obstacles. Examples might be the waterfront in cities built on large rivers, or a major road. Note in the latter case that the road may have a dual nature, being a path for someone travelling in a car but an edge to the pedestrian.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Legibility in information visualisalion</head><p>The overall aim of our research is to apply legibility techniques developed in the domain of urban planning to the domain of information visual&amp;&amp;on. The application of Lynch's work to computer generated environments has been considered recently by other researchers. Rudy Darken and John Sibert [73 consider a number of issues associated with navigation in virtual environments. They evaluate a space which makes use of landmarks and districts to aid navigation tasks in a flat simulation of the sea containmg ship objects. In developing the BEAD system Matthew Chalmers [5, 61 considers the use of legibility features, among other techniques, in the production of useable information spaces and uses landmarks, edges and districts in a visualisatlon system based on a landscape metaphor.</p><p>This work presented here differs from this research in its development of techniques to automatically construct the Eve legibility features listed above in the abstract spaces produced by a variety of existing or future data visualisation systems, such as database or document store visualisers. One of our main aims is to accomplish this with without requiring the users of the system to perform the placement of the features manually. Essentially the system should, wherever possible, identify and place legibility features using information available from the database and visualisation systems alone.</p><p>A prototype system, called LEADS (LEgibility for Abstract Data Spaces) has been developed to demonstrate this concept and to form a basis for evaluating its effectiveness. LEADS provides a layer on top of existing visualisation systems and performs the addition of legibility information to the space. LEADS acts on the position of data items provided by this underlying system, as well as accessing the raw data where necessary, to add and emphasise objects which are used to improve the legibility of the environment. While this process may sometimes mean that the representation of objects is altered to some extent it is our intention to make as few changes as possible to the layout produced by the underlying system. LEADS is designed to improve the legibility of the space without destroying any significance that specialised visual&amp;ion systems may attach to the absolute or relative positions of objects in the space.</p><p>We have stated above that the formation of cognitive maps is a learning process, so the spaces to which we apply legibility enhancements must allow this to happen. Thii allows us to &amp;fine criteria for appropriate spaces.</p><p>First, the space, or the visual&amp;ion, must persist over a long period of time. This is necessary in order that enough time is available for learning of the space to take place. Spaces which are created for a specific purpose and then destroyed will simply not be available for long enough for their layout to be memo&amp;d. Second the information in the space must be relatively stable. If the data is constantly in flux it will cause problems in two ways; it may be difficult to actually produce and place the legibility features in a useful way and even if we could they would quickly become irrelevant either because they no longer relate to the data or because they move too much to be useful reference points. Fiually, the space should be available for users to re-enter and use repeatedly. Thii will allow learning over time to take place naturally. As examples, we might consider visualisations of large document stores, file systems or information retrieval systems such as the World Wide Web to be suited to thii approach. These different visualisation systems will map the data onto 3D space in a number of ways so any system developed must be general enough to cope with this variety.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Methods and algorithms for the placement of legibility features</head><p>Thii section will describe the algorithms which have been developed to generate the placement of legibility features in three dimensional information visualisalion spaces. Each of the five features will be addressed individually in the order in which they are created in the LEADS system. Thii order is important as the placement of some of the features depends on those which have already been generated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Diitricts</head><p>The discovery of districts wittin the data is a matter of finding groups of items which have strong similarities to each other which they do not have with other items in the space. Bearing in mind the goal of the work which is to accomplish the placement of features automatically the discovery of these groups is not a trivial procedure. Some of the problems that must be contended with are: how many of these groups exist? how do we measure (dis)similarity between data items? when do we stop trying to divide the clusters we already have?</p><p>In order to identify districts within an arbitrary data space the LEADS system uses techniques from the field of cluster analysis, for which a number of algorithms have already been developed. In choosing an algorithm for the LEADS system we set the criteria that it should be simple, due to time constrah-&amp; on the project, relatively computationally inexpensive and reasonably effective for a wide range of clusters. We have initially adopted Zahn's Minimal Spanning Tree algorithm (MST) <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>. This algorithm first constructs a minimal spanning tree of the data such that the edge values are taken to be the euclidian diitance, or other similarity measure, between the items. Clusters are then produced by identifying and eliminathtg 'inconsistent' edges, which are defined as edges of the spanning tree whose values are significantly greater than the nearby edge values.</p><p>The basic algorithm as described by Zahn is able to detect clusters of varying shapes and sixes so long as they are relatively distinct (some of the specific cases where it will not perform accurately are described in the original paper [lo]). A specific advantage for LEADS is that the use of minii spanning trees lends itself to cluster analysis of so called network structured spaces where one can identify explicit links between data objects (e.g. hyper-medii structures or general&amp;d object models). Furthermore, when compared to other clustering algorithms this method is relatively inexpensive computationally. Fast algorithms for producing minimum spanning trees are well known and the identilication of inconsistent edges is relatively simple.</p><p>Once districts have been identified, they need to be represented in the visualisation. For example, one might use the attributes of colour and shape to give each district a distinct character (see section 5). Districts also provide the basis for creating the remaining legibility features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Edges</head><p>The next feature we need to cover is the edge. These are (usually) imposing features which section off one area from another. It seems sensible therefore to &amp;fine edges as existing between adjoining districts. The main problems to be solved with edges are: between which districts should they be placed? what shape should they be? how big should they be and how should they be positioned and oriented?</p><p>We will consider three methods for defining edges. The llrst is a quick and diiy method which will not be effective for all shapes of clusters but which should work tolerably well for those which are generally spherical or cuboid iu shape. This simple approach is to find the nearest neighbour data items between the clusters using the same similarity measure as was employed in the clustering process. The edge can them be placed between the clusters along the line connecting these two items, with appropriate orientation. Provided that the objects do not excessively cut into the clusters or are positioned far from their logical joining point these methods should be effective in providing a reference point and defining the borders of clusters.</p><p>The second method involves finding the hull of each district and creating an edge just beyond this. This has a number of drawbacks. Most importantly finding the hull of the cluster of objects in 3D space is not a trivial task and would work out to be computationally expensive. Considering that the system will already be carrying out a large number of computations in order to carry out the clustering to produce districts the trade-off between complexity aud accurate positioning of the edge objects becomes quite importan&amp; especially if the situation of having to completely redo the whole legibility process after a large number of changes to the space looks likely to occur often. The third method is a refinement of this which again involves finding the hulls of the adjoining districts. Once this is complete the edge could be defined by interpolation between the points along adjoining edges of districts, as shown in <ref type="figure">fig. I</ref>. Sophisticated interpolation methods might produce a smoother edge topology at the expense of some time.</p><p>Considering the problems that would come with attempting to End the hulls of all the clusters for the initial implementation of the LEADS system we decided to use the first method described here, positioning the edges between cluster nearest neighbours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Landmarks</head><p>Landmarks need to be stable points within the data space that can be used as a common reference point for navigation. We will illustrate three possible methods which we have devised for defining landmark positions.</p><p>'he methods described here are based on the definitions of the districts and will therefo-re rely on these being quite stable so that the landmarks are not constantly moving as the database changes. This should not be a problem iu the relatively slow moving type of space for which the system has been designed, although it must be expected that the laudmarks will be subject to some 'drift' over time as the database profile evolves.</p><p>Method 1: Cluster centroids. Most partitional clustering algorithms will define the centroid of a group while it is being formed. This centroid is a virtual data element that best describes the cluster as a whole. Our Erst method is to simply define landmarks to be the cluster centroids as &amp;tied within the clustering algorithm. If the algorithm used does not define centroids it should be possible to simply apply a centroid generation method similar to that which would be used with a clustering algorithm to the finiihed clusters. A slight variation of this method might be to place the landmark at a cluster's geometric centre. This method will therefore define a single landmark for each of the clusters which could act as a beacon for navigation to the 'heart' of the district The main question to consider is if this is the most suitable place for a landmark. The centre of the cluster may be densely populated with data items but on the other hand it oould just as easily be rather sparse. In large clusters these laudmarks may easily become lost in the vast group. We felt that this method of placing landmarks would not take account of the concentration of clusters and data and so would not necessarily position landmarks in areas where external references were most useful. We also felt that the districts would be well enough defined by their own character and edges that reference points at their centres would not be essential.</p><p>Method 2: Cluster intersections. This second method places landmarks wherever more than two districts iuter~. This is a simple method that would require identifying which districts are adjacent and finding a midpoint between the closest members of the districts. This method results in fewer landmarks than simply using the centroids but those landmarks which 'are created appear in the areas of the space where a number of clusters meet. This implies that these are areas where there are a number of clusters bordering on each other. It is in this sort of area where a stable reference point might help in navigation and so is a better choice for the placement of laudmarks.</p><p>Method 3: Cluster centroid triangulation.</p><p>The Enal method again uses the centroids of the districts but will place landmarks at the ceutre of the triangles formed by the centroids of any group of three adjacent clusters. This is illustrated in flg.2 this will produce approximately the same number of landmarks as the cluster intersection method. The position of the landmarks, although seemingly quite similar to that produced by Method 2 is signilicantly different in that the landmark is placed in a central position between the points which most typify the districts rather than relying solely on the geometric point of intersection. We suspect that this will give a more even 'balance* to the placement of the landmarks than simply positioning them at the intersection points and will make the landmark positions more responsive to the shapes of the clusters as well as their positions. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Nodes and paths</head><p>Nodes and paths are strongly inter-related and will therefore be considered together. We propose that paths should be composed of lit&amp;s between nodes which are individual elements of the visualisation. Eventually, we intend paths to evolve as a function of use of the space with information about movement of users and database access being recorded for this purpose. Two main issues therefore need to be considered. The first is which, if any, elements will be used as initial nodes and paths, before any usage information has been gathered. The second is how the node and path layout will evolve with use. So far, we have implemented algorithms for the tit of these and have proposals for the second.</p><p>The choice of initial nodes and paths in an unused information space is a difficult problem. On one hand it will be useful to have these features available to aid initial legibility and imageability of the space while on the other hand we must be careful not to 'colour' the usage of the space too much. Presuming that absolutely no usage information has been recorded, it will be necessary to make 'educated guesses' at data elements which might possibly become nodes through usage. We have implemented the following approach: l The nearest neighbour elements between districts might represent good initial choices as these are the most similar items across district boundaries. We shall call such nodes gateways. l An additional main node for each district might be deEned as that data element closest to the centroid of the cluster as this might be seen as being the item most typical of the district. In network type spaces there may be further data available to identify such nodes ,automatically, such as connectivity information (valency) or measures of amounts of data stored, both of which imply importance.</p><p>Examples of these items are shown in <ref type="figure">fig. 3</ref>. Currently the implementation Erst identifies the gateway nodes and forms paths between nearest neighhour pairs in adjoining districts and then within. districts all the gateway nodes are lied together with a spanning tree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>fig.3: Major and minor paths joining four districts</head><p>Considering dynamic usage information, we propose that the positions of node, path and gateway features should evolve in response to the way in which they are accessed. The type of statistics that will be used will be concerned with both the frequency of access to individual items and the sequence in which the items are examined. For example: l The ability of a data item to potentially become a node might depend on the number of queries which were made to the item within a certain time period. Within each district this metric might be the top n% of the frequently most used nodes.</p><p>l The definition of a path link between two elements might depend on the number of times those elements were accessed in sequence. We might therefore defiue the set of path links as the top n% of possible links where n will be found by experimentation. We aim to produce two levels of path which will reflect different levels of use within the space. Within the set of path edges some of those most used will be further highlighted to show the most popular routes between gateways. Special care must be taken however to evolve slowly from the set of initial paths and nodes. It will also be important to ensure the connectivity of paths to all gateway nodes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">An example application -browsing tbe World Wide Web</head><p>The previous section has described the general algorithms and techniques implemented in LEADS. In this section, we will present a specific example of how LEADS has been used to enhance an existing visualisation tool. In fact, we have so far applied LEADS to three visualisation systems: Given the space constraints of this paper, we will focus only on the last of these. FDP-Grapher (FDP = Force Directed Placement), is a 3D tool for visualising arbitrary networks. The visualisation approach is based on a spring-forces model where nodes of the network am treated as masses and links as springs. Initially the nodes are placed randomly and the system then goes through a cycle of repositioning the nodes, based on the tension in the springs, until a relatively stable formation is found. In addition, each link in the graph can be given a weight which will alter the way in which the tension value is calculated. The resulting visual&amp;ion shows the network drawn in 3-D such that strongly inter-linked nodes are drawn together into the same regions of space.</p><p>FDP-Grapher might have many applications. Our cUrrent application is to visualise areas of the World Wide Web. Users of this application are currently able to: l see an overview of several hundred linked Web nodes; l navigate this with six degrees of freedom; l select nodes in order to either obtain summary information or to launch the Mosiac browser in order to inspect their contents; l grab nodes and reposition them iu order to stretch out the visual&amp;&amp;ion; and l see embodiments of other users who are currently accessing the system, access their embodiments to find out who they are (e.g. see their home pages) and communicate with them over audio links. In other words, this is a multi-user, distributed and shareable visuahsation tool. <ref type="figure">Fig.4</ref> shows an example of FDP-Grapher being used to visualise a network of 449 nodes. In the figure we see the nodes represented as spheres and links as lines. LEADS attempts to enhance the legibility of this system through the above techniques. After the addition of the legibility features we can see the presence of a number of large districts, recognisable by their different shapes and colours, separated by the planes of edges. Some of the existing links in the system have been enhanced to form paths with nodes along them. Landmarks are, also present where some clusters join. Also visible in the second screen shot is the axis object, an optional addition to the space which remains aligned with the major axes as a reference for orientation purposes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Reflections</head><p>We are currently undertaking an experimental evaluation of LEADS. In the meantime, we present a few initial observations arising from the process of designing, implementing and testing the system. Our initial experiences have been largely positive and we suspect that this approach dces have the potential to signiEcantly improve the legibility of virtual environments. However, we have encountered a number of difficulties which have suggested some immediate improvements to the system. First, legibility features such as paths seem to sit uncomfortably with 6 degrees of freedom navigation. Paths iu a city are actually travelled along and the environment is therefore experienced from the perspective of the path. We suspect that users of our legible virtual environments should also directly experience paths as part of navigation. Thus, we have recently developed simple interface techniques to support navigation via paths, so that selecting a path causes the user to traverse it to the destination node.</p><p>Second automatically determining an appropriate scale and appearance for legibility features has not always been easy. In particular, features such as landmarks and edges must be visible without being intrusive. Creating useful edges has proved to be a particularly difficult task as an edge should ideally follow the contours of a district. In a 3-D space, determining a sensible size for edges has been difEcult. At one extreme an edge might be a hull completely surrounding a district. At the other it might be a thin flat surface dividing two districts. The former is likely to be visually iutrusive; the latter may provide au insufficient sense of separation between districts.</p><p>Third, other features and tools are clearly needed to help people navigate. For example, the use of textual information in the form of signposts is an important part of navigating conventional urban environments. In the field of city planning signposts are often considered to be something of an admission of failure [43, that the planner was unable to produce a sufficiently legible environment, but we concur with the view of Passini that they are in fact a useful, even invaluable tool during wayfinding tasks. For this reason we are endeavouring to include signposts in our environments where possible. Currently these appear attached to the paths near to the node objects and identify the item to which the path leads. However, this gives rise to the problem of how to name districts and landmarks. More specifically, given that districts and landmarks are automatically created by LEADS, we are left with the problem of automatic name generation or alternatively the use of symbolic identifiers on signposts.</p><p>Fourth, LEADS has to use visual attributes of objects to convey certain legibility information (e.g. showing districts). It will be important not to overload attributes which already have a specific meaning in the visualisation (e.g. what if colour is aheady used to show when a node has been visited in our WWW application?). Ideally, LEADS ought to be able to query a visualisation application to find out what mappings or representations it already uses, in order to chose non-conflicting ones for legibility information. In turn, this suggests that visualisations ought to make their mappings available to other applications in some explicit form.</p><p>Finally, we need to be careful that by adding additional objects to an information visual&amp;ion, we do not increase the rendering overhead thereby degrading system perfotmance. However, we suspect some LEADS extensions might enable it to actually improve system performance. Specitically, I.EADS might enable a distancing effect for data spaces by allowing all individual data items in a district to be replaced by a single object when viewed from a distance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Summary</head><p>We have described a number of general techniques for improving the legibility of virtual environments so that their users might more easily construct cognitive maps to help them navigate. Our work has adapted techniques from the discipline of city planning where decades of experience have identified key features of urban landscapes which are critical to their legibility. The primary goal of our work has be43 to develop a set of algorithms for autornaticaZZy creating or enhancing these features within information visual&amp;ions. These include: l the use of clustering algorithms to create districts; l the creation of edge objects separating districts; l the placement of landmark objects at a central point between districts; l emphasising nearest neighbour node objects within districts and creating paths between them. We have implemented these techniques ln a system called LEADS which is intended to provide an additional legibility layer sitting on top of current information visualisations. So far, we have applied LEADS to three existing and contrasting information visualisation tools and have described one of these, a tool to visual&amp; areas of the World Wide Web, in this paper. Our early experiences have been positive and suggests that this approach is promising. However; we have encountered several difticulties including the need to experience paths when navigating; the difficulty of getting an appropriate scale for features such as edges and landmarks; and problems with automatically naming features so that they may be referred to by signposts. We are currently undertaking a formal evaluation of LEADS and we look forward to reporting its results in due course.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>l</head><label></label><figDesc>Paths.
