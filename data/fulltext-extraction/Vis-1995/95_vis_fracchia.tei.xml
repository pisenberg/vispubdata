				<p>The investigation of mechanisms responsible for the morphogenesis of complex biological organisms is an important area in biology. P. patens is an especially suitable plant for this research because it is a rather simple organism, facilitating its observation, yet it possesses developmental phenomena analogous to those which occur in higher plants, allowing the extrapolation of hypotheses to more complex organisms. The visualization consists of three components: biological data collection, computer-modelling (using L-systems), and model verification. The simulated developmental process is quite realistic and provides an excellent means for verifying the underlying hypotheses of morphogenesis.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Biologists often employ a multidisciplinary investigative approach to gain insights into the nature of complex biological processes. Traditionally, this has consisted, in large part, of cytological, physiological, and genetical studies. During the last decade, application of the techniques of modern molecular genetics has significantly accelerated the rate of progress.</p><p>Mosses, in particular Physcomitrella patens (P. patens), have become popular as simple model systems for studying plant development <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref>. Our present understanding of mosses is derived from physiological experimentation with Funaria hygrometrica <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and genetical studies using P. patens <ref type="bibr">[ 1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</p><p>The genetical approach has involved the isolation of a wide variety of developmental mutants of P. patens by conventional mutagenic procedures [ 1,4] followed by detailed cytological and physiological analysis of their phenotypes. This has revealed key developmental transitions and facilitated construction of an elaborate model of the roles of hormones and other factors, such as light and gravity, in regulating morphogenesis <ref type="bibr">[ 1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neil W. Ashton Department of Biology University of Regina Regina, SK S4S OA2 Canada</head><p>The objective of the research proposed in this case study is to facilitate, using mathematical modelling in combination with computer graphics, the detailed elucidation of mechanisms underlying the development of mosses. Our aim is to complement other approaches and make feasible rapid advances in comprehension of the developmental processes of these relatively simple plants and, by extension, of plants generally.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Physcomitrelia patens</head><p>Generally speaking, the development of P. patens under defined standard culture conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> begins with a spore which germinates to produce filaments of green chloronemal cells which grow by apical divisions approximately every twenty hours. Subapical cells produce branches which form new apical cells ( <ref type="figure">Figure  la</ref>). After roughly six days some chloronemal apical cells divide to produce caulonemal apical cells. These caulonemal apical cells divide much faster (approx. every five hours) giving rise to reddish caulonemal filaments, most of which exhibit clockwise curvature. Most subapical caulonemal cells divide to form side branch initials. Between 85 to 95% of these branches give rise to secondary chloronemata, 5 to 6% become secondary caulonemata, and the remaining either do not develop further or produce a bud <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 2a</ref>). These buds develop into gametophores (leafy shoots). Much of the development remains relatively planar, with the exception of the leafy shoots which grow upwards ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3a</ref>). P. patens is an especially suitable plant model system for various reasons. Firstly, the occurrence of developmental phenomena, analogous to those which occur in higher plants may make it possible to apply what is learned to other species. Secondly, the small size, short life cycle, and apical cell growth facilitates the recognition of precise cell lineages. Thirdly, the extended haploid gametophytic phase facilitates the isolation of a (See color plates, page CP-45) 1070-2385/95 $4.00 0 1995 IEEE variety of mutants. Finally, there exist established methodologies for genetic analysis, and a large database of information on P. patens <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Visualization in biology</head><p>Visualization has played a major role in many aspects of biology and related fields from molecular modelling, to pattern formation, to volume visualization techniques used in biomedical applications. However, with respect to the visualization of plants, there have been relatively few in comparison. The one method which seems most prominent is the use of L-systems, developed by Lindenmayer in 1968 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> as a mathematical formalism for describing plant morphogenesis. They have been used to create breath-takingly life-like plant models <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>We use the formalism of L-systems to create a realistic model of P. patens. Although many plants have been generated with L-systems, this is the first time that they have been used to model the development of an entire organism at the cell level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Visualization of P. patens 2.1 Data collection</head><p>Since the model is to be represented visually, data must be gathered that include geometrical properties of the growth of this plant. Relevant data include cell cycle times, branching angles, timing of differentiation events, probabilities of cell fates, filament curvature, and phototropic, gravitropic, and chemotropic responses.</p><p>Some of this data is readily available such as caulonemal branch fates <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, while other data, such as branching angles, require many observations. For the purpose of creating an initial model of P. patens growth, we relied as much as possible upon data already documented, along with some simple assumptions concerning branching angles and more elaborate ones related to chloronemal spacing and differentiation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">L-system model</head><p>The basic idea of L-systems is to define a complex object by repeatedly replacing simpler parts of the object. This is done by specifying an initial object composed of symbols, or axiom, (for example, A) and a set of production rules that describes how the symbols and those that follow will change (for example, A --i, AB and B + A). Symbols are modified by matching their labels with the left hand side (predecessor) of the production rule, and replacing them with the those on the right hand side of the rule (successor). This process occurs in parallel for all symbols of the object. Thus, successive replacements result in more and more complex objects (A becomes .4B which becomes ABA which becomes ABAAB and so on). In our model, the symbols represent cells, the rules describe their behaviour (growth, division, differentiation), and the resulting strings of symbols form the developmental stages of growth.</p><p>The following L-system describes the general development of P. patens as described in Section 1.  The software used to generate the visual representations of the L-system model is called cpfg by Prusinkiewicz2 and Hanan3. It interprets specific symbols as graphics commands which draw the objects. We have used cylinders for cells, spheres for the spore and buds, and bicubic patches for leafy shoots (modelled using ise, written by Hanan). <ref type="figure">Figure lb</ref> illustrates the simulated development of chloronemata after six days of growth. The branching angles were chosen such that the chloronemal cells produced a circular colony, irrespective of the number of initial filaments. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2b</ref> a caulonemal filament is shown wh.ich generates two buds (one has become a leafy shoot), three secondary caulonemal filaments, and many 'The actual L-system is comprised of 65 production rules. *P.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Verification</head><p>The simulated developmental process derived from the expression of models using L-systems provides an excellent means for verifying the underlying hypotheses of P. patens morphogenesis. When discrepancies between the model and P. patens are observed, the model can be adjusted in accordance with further observations and reexamined. Thus, the process of observation, hypothesis formation, model construction, and verification is iterative. Samples of four L-system models that evolved, over several iterations are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>Although the L-system model is a much simplified version of the actual organism (which is clear from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 1 and 2)</ref>, the simulation very closely resembles the real organism <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 3</ref>).</p><p>Furthermore, it has already led to several significant insights. For example, the circular shape of the initial chloronemal colony is independent of the number of filaments generated from the spore. This was known but the mechanism had never been examined. Without a proper mechanism the oddly shaped model of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5a</ref> resulted. One solution was to use a simple model to vary the branching angle of new chloronemal apical cells in a way that maximizes colonization of the available space. The underlying cause is currently under investigation.</p><p>Also, it had been hypothesized that primary chloronemal apical cells differentiated after their individual age is six days. However, this resulted in an overabundance of primary chloronemata in the centre of the colony, as illustrated by the mass of green cells in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5b</ref>. It was determined that differentiation occurred after the global age of the organism was six days and that all primary chloronemal apical cells had to either differentiate or terminate after this time.</p><p>However, another problem was introduced by the differentiation of secondary chloronemal apical cells into caulonemata. This resulted in an overabundance of red caulonemata, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5c</ref>. Determining that secondary chloronemata had their own distinct pattern of development resulted in a more realistic model ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure  5d</ref>). The addition of leafy shoots resulted in the most realistic model <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Future work</head><p>An initial computer-generated model has proven quite successful, realistically recreating P. patens development from a single cell into a complete gametophyte. The power of this model results, in part, from the ability to allow the investigator to readily vary model rules which in the real organism are difficult or impossible to change.</p><p>Also, the computer simulation focuses attention on those aspects of development which are most important for an overall understanding of moss morphogenesis and which warrant further investigation in the real plant; for example: the space-filling of chloronemal development, the fates of side-branch initials, shoot development, the effects of phototropism, gravitropism, chemotropism, and thigmotropism, and the development of mutants. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows a simulation of an ,OVE mutant that generates an abundance of buds and deformed shoots.     </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>where the probabilities on the right of the CAUL-SBI rules are used to choose the production.
