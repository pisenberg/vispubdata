				<p>We present a new method for adaptive surface meshing and triangulation which controls the local level-of-detail of the surface approximation by local spectral estimates. These estimates are determined by a wavelet representation of the surface data. The basic idea is to decompose the initial data set by means of an orthogonal or semi-orthogonal tensor product wavelet transform (WT) and to analyze the resulting coeflcients. In surface regions, where thepartial energy ofthe resulting coeficients is low, the polygonal approximation of the St&amp;ace can be performed with larger triangles without loosing too much fine grain details. However since the localization ofthe WTis boundby the Heisenbergprinciple themeshing method has to be controlled by the detail signals rather than directly by the coeficients. Thedyadicscaling of the WTstimulated us to buildan hierarchical meshing algorithm which transforms the initially regular data grid into a quadtree representation by rejection of unimportant mesh vertices. The optimum triangulation ofthe resulting quadtree cells is carried out bv selection from a look-uv table. The tree grows recursively as controlled by detail signais which are computed from a modified inverse WT. In order to control the locai level-of-detail, we introduce a newclassofwaveletspacefiltersactingas &quot;magniSyingglasses&quot;on the data.</p>

This problem is not only striking in the field of digital terrain modeling and flight simulation, but also in many other applications, such as finite element, radiosity <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref> or parametric surface meshing <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>. Hence,adaptivetrianglereductiontechniqueswereestablished in the past. Most of them try to find mathematical criteria for the importance of a particular mesh vertex, remove it if applicable andperform a local retriangulation of the mesh. [ 181 for instance analyzes single vertices in the mesh and defines a planarity criterion to decide on the removal of the vertex. In order to avoid cracks in the surface, alocal Delaunay triangulation has to be performed. Quadtree-based methods <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref> were proposed mostly for radios@ meshing, where the mesh is controlled by the illumination gradient.

The reduction of the triangle mesh is computationally expensive and once local retriangmations are performed, extensive work on data structures and list management is required. There is no elegant way to focus the level-of-detail locally onto interesting data features-a property of increasing importance in complex data sets. On the other hand, the wavelet transform, as presented in <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[ 131 or [3]</ref> has been discovered for computer graphics: <ref type="bibr">[ 111 and [ 151</ref> proposed volume rendering techniques, whereas 1121 published a volume morphing method-Even approximate solutions of the ra-diositVwuationcanbeachievedusin~WTs181.aswellasvisualization of multidimensional features, sich as in' is].

The initially regular surface data grid has to be transformed into a quadtree structure and each quadtree cell has to be triangtdated using a Iook-up table. In order to decide, whether a particular mesh vertex can be removed, we first apply a WTonto the data and then iteratively reconstruct the detail signals. The amplitude of the detail signal is taken as a measure for the local frequency characteristics and decides on the removal of points. The dyadic scale of the standard WT reconstructs the detail signals from the different frequency channels in a single step mode. After the first step each second data vertex of the grid is analyzed. Then, as the iteration proceeds thenextdetail signal is reconstructed and each fourth vertex is analyzed and so forth.

The next section sheds light on the quadtree-based mesh representation we propose and shows how to derive local optimal cell triangulations from a look-up table. The algorithmic complexity of the method as well as an error analysis is elaborated in chapter 4.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">How to Recover Detail Signals</head><p>One problemarising with the fast QMFimplementations of the wavelet transform is, that we need access to the difference signal in eachiterationstepmofthereconstruction.Thisisnecessarybecause the detail signal at a particular mesh vertex finally decides whether or not it can be removed.

We will address this problem again in chapter 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Significance of Wavelet Coefficients</head><p>Once the data set is transformed into wavelet space, it is necessary to find appropriate criteria to control the accuracy of the surface approximation provided by the wavelet bases. Furthermore, a norm has to be found as a framework for the definition of error bounds. This can be accomplished using the signal energy Egpx which is definedbythe I,'-norm. Hence, wefilterthecoefftcients accordingto:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">(9)</formula><p>Increasing r will result in increasing the error bounds of the approximation and decreasing r will also decrease the approximation error.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Level-of-detail Filtering in Wavelet Space</head><p>The introduction of an energy threshold provides a tool for globally influencing the approximation of the wavelets. However, one of the major strengths of the WT has not been harvested so far: the localization properties. The local support of the basis functions allows us to localize them both in spatial and in frequency domain and rejecting a particular basis will only affect its area of support. This important property enables an elegant control of the local level-of-detail of the approximation. For this purpose, the coefficients have to be weighted according to the definition of the ROI which corresponds to a filter operation in wavelet space. It can be defined in analogy with the well known filters in spatial or frequency domain.Sincethefilteraffectsthelocalfrequencycharacteristicsofthe signal, we propose to call it wavelet spacefilter.</p><p>Let g(x,y) be a Gaussian weighting function, centered at (~0, yo), scaled by (ox, uy) and rotated by 0 which quantifies the levelof-detail around some location in space (xg, yo) and whose elliptical shape is depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4a</ref>. In order to compute its transformation into wavelet space, we have to note that any point (x0, yo) in spatial domain can only be located within the Heisenberg bound in wavelet domain. Furthermore, the spatial localization decreases with increasing iteration depth m</p><p>With the dyadic scale of our 2D-WT, however, the Gaussian splits into all frequency channels and their centers are carried out in wavelet space according to:</p><p>A$=$, yom :=g where x"' and y"' denote the local coordinates of the frequency channels of depthm, as presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4</ref>. Their variances scale according to: cl+g. op=g <ref type="bibr">(11)</ref> and the rotation angle 0 is invariant to the transform. The set of Gaussian weighting functions (g"(P, y'")} in wavelet space can be elegantly described by using homogeneous coordinates: gm(p,ym) = e-(Rm~pm)T(Rm~~m)+l <ref type="formula">12</ref>The matrix Rm stands for the affine transform of the Gaussian: COSQ -sinQ -";; amx CP x am lP-= g@ COSQ 0</p><p>[ --I -jm am am am (13) 0' 0' ;</p><p>andp" = (x", y", 1 jTdenotes a position in homogeneous coordinates.</p><p>-To summarize this section: the control of the local level-of-de-tat1 of the wavelet approximation can be accomplished by using one single Gaussian weighting function which surrounds the region of interest in the initial data set. This Gaussian can be interpreted as a filter which is transformed into multiple Gaussians, one in each frequency channel in wavelet space. Premultiplying the coefficients with these Gaussian maps forces any subsequent thresholding to pass only coefftcients located within the selected ROI. All others will be removed and hence the reconstructed signal will be most acl curate within the ROI along with a Gaussian smoothing of the boundaries. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> stresses the effect of level-of-detail filtering. The digital terrain model is decomposed with Haarwavelets andtiltered with Gaussians of different locations and parameters. The model is perfectly reconstructed within the focus of the Gaussian, whereas only the scaling functions represent the dataoutside. In the boundary region, less and less high frequency information is provided and the data becomes more and more "boxlike". Obviously, the proposed wavelet space filter acts as a "magnifying glass " onto the data.</p><p>We recommend applying the Gaussian filter and the thresholds only to the wavelets and keeping all coefficients of the scaling function, because they carry the DC fraction of the signal. a) b) 3.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Point Removal in Regular Triangle Meshes</head><p>So far, we elaborated some mathematical criteria for approximating a surface data set, sampled on a regular grid, using a multiresolution hierarchy. In order to build an adaptive surface triangulation, however, it is necessary to remove unimportant mesh vertices andtofindatriangulationoftheremainingones.Thebasiccriterion, by which a mesh vertex is labeled as unimportant is given by the mathematical frameworkofthe wavelet transform. Keeping inmind that any triangulation of the surface provides a planar approximation, we only have to bound the error between the original surface functionx&amp;y) and the bilinear interpolant provided by a triangle. Supposing furthermore that the initial data is expanded by wavelet bases, the detail signal in iteration m helps us to decide whether or not each 2m+ lth mesh vertex is necessary for the triangle approximation. Fist, we visit each second vertex and analyze the value of the detail signal of iteration m=l . If, let's say, the detail signald Ifin some neighborhood of vertex n is sufftciently low, then the vertex is not important and the approximation can be accomplished by a linear interpolation between vertex n-l and n+l. This scheme can now be applied recursively by subsequent computation of the detail signalsd "ff,m=l,..,Mand by visiting all dyadic vertices at positions n = 2mk+l. Once the detail signal is sufficiently small and the adjacent vertices in step m-l are already removed, we are allowed to label the current vertex as well.</p><p>As a consequence, our procedure results in recursively buildregular mesh quadtree at m=i quadtree at m2 0 vertices to be analyzed at ml vertices to be analyzed at m=2 0 vertices to be analyzed at m=3 <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>: Recursive growth of a quadtree from the regular mesh by analyzing the detail signals of the WT at each dyadic vertex.</p><p>ing aquadtreerepresentation of the initial mesh by removing dyadic vertices. <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref> again illustrates the thinning method which finally figures out the symbolic quadtree representation of the mesh vertices depicted as an example in <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>. The nodes of the quadtree contain either pointers to some child-nodes, or in case of leaves, point to the entries of a vertex list.</p><p>vertex list <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>: Symbolic representation of the mesh using a quadtree data structure. Note again here that the growth of our quadtree is entirely controlled by a single energy threshold r embedded in the function space of the wavelets. The final maximum depth of the tree depends on the upper decomposition bound M of the WT.</p><p>In order to finally decide whether or not a mesh vertex can be removed, we have to consider the following criteria which help to preserve the topology of the tree. Only in cases, where all criteria are TRUE, can the vertex be removed:</p><p>. Wuvelet-criterion: a vertex at iteration m can be removed, if the sum of the squares of its difference signal and those within a 4-neighborhood at resolution m is less than an upper bound a. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 8a)</ref> .</p><p>Resolution-criterion: a vertex at iteration m can be removed, if the four surrounding vertices at resolution m-l were previously removed <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 8b)</ref>.</p><p>. m to m-2-criterion: a vertex can be removed, if the resulting cell is not adjacent to any cell with higher resolution than m-2. Thus, we restrict the growth to cell transitions fromm to m-2 which simplifies the triangulation algorithm <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 8~</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>a) wavelet b) resolution c) m to m-2 criterion criterion criterion</head><p>A~+A;+AZ,+A:,+A;se Another aspect of the method is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 9a</ref>, where vertex P is analyzed. Suppose P survives all of the above criteria. If we remove P, however and if Pu and PL are already removed, i.e. if two adjacent cells have the same resolution, then we must reject the vertices A and B on the cell boundaries, too. Hence, when traversing the vertex array from upper left to lower right, one has to keep track of upper and left vertices of the same iteration step m as well.</p><p>cell then consider mesh vertices which account for the m-2 transitions. This may cause some triangles to be split up into two pieces, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 13</ref>. Consequently, the algorithm first computes the case form to m-l and then it decides on the corresponding subcase, by simply analyzing the flags of all intermediate vertices responsible for transitions from m to m-2. Although we get 625 possible cases, the total number of triangles required does not exceed 96. They are stored in a look-up table.</p><p>This additional criterion ends up with a partitioning of the initial array into different regions (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 9b</ref>). Within these different regions, we have to checkonly left, upper or both adjacent vertices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Look-up Tables for Local Triangulations</head><p>All subcases are hardcoded and contain references to these look-up table entries. Note, that although there are 625 cases only one computation of the outcode and at most 8 additional tests are necessary to compute the triangulation. It is clear that we end up with a very efficient algorithm by doing the meshing without any geometric computation but by just checking vertices along the cell edges. Once the tree is built from the above procedure, the quadtree A corresponding pseudocode for the recursive quadtree tracells have to be triangulated. A generic problem arising from mes-versal and meshing is given with:</p><p>hing hierarchies of rectangular surface patches is the occurrence of cracks [ 11. A crack occurs if we do not take care of adjacency of auadtree cells of different denth and. hence different resolution. The &amp;face may break up, hole's may appear and any consistency required for normal interpolation gets lost. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig.10</ref> shows a crack and also shows how to modify the triangulation to get rid of it. The scheme we introduce here for fast and consistent cell triangulation is based on the following observation: consider <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 11</ref>, where two adjacent cells are depicted along with topological arrangements that may occur for transitions from resolution m to m-l andm-2. ThereareonlyS casesattherespectivecellboundary.Let's presume that we restrict the growth of the quadtree so that only transitions up to m-2 are possible (resolution criterion). Consequently, the set of possible arrangements of vertices at the four cell boundaries can now be derived from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 11</ref>. Moreover, some look-up tables may be built containing the triangulations as explained below. For cell transitions from m to m-l a look-up table with 16 entries is built as presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 12</ref>. The central idea of the algorithm is to first solve the triangulation within each cell form to m-l. This is accomplished by analyzing the mesh vertices along each cell edge.</p><p>The fast computation of the look up table entry can be accomplished by a binary outcode, generated from bitwise addition of the flags of the respective edge vertices, as indicated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 12</ref>.</p><p>Once the corresponding look-up  </p></div>

Thus, local high frequency variations in our data force the meshing to be more dense. of the coefftcients used for the approximation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>We presented a method for fast and efficient surface meshing which benefits from two basic ideas: First, any control of the surface mesh is computed by using an initial wavelei decomposition of the data samoles. The mathematical framework of the WT allows us to bound the errors of the approximation and efftcient criteria on whether or not single mesh vertices can be removed are provided by analyzing WT outputs. Furthermore, wavelet space filters allow a control of the quality of the surface approximation within local regionsofinterestandactaslocal"magnifyingglaases". Secondly,the dyadic structure of the 2D-WT motivated us to build a quadmesh from the initial regular grid. Any triangulation of each quadtree cell is obtained by using a look-up table and hence no additional computation is required for the triangulation, as with standard Delaunay-based methods.</p><p>Due to the low complexity of this algorithm, we can achieve retriangulations of the surface at nearly interactive rates on SGI work&amp;ions. Thus, we guess that our-method is particularly well suited forreal-time applications, as virtual reality or flight and driving simulation. Especially, when considering low altitude flights the Gaussian filter could helo to control the level-of-detail of the pilot's field of vision. Moreover, any object instance of a geomet&amp; data base related to the terrain might also be controlled by the wavelet transform. For this purpose, the actual depth of the quadtree at the obiect's location on the terrain is used to govern the data base and to-select the object instance to be rendered.</p><p>Althouah the method reouires an inverse WT with each new triangulatio;, we have proven the algorithmic complexity is still low. It is clear that we can map the WT onto special purpose hardware, such as signal processors. Currently, the method is implemented in terms of different AVS modules.</p><p>Future research has to be conducted towards extensions of the method for 3D isosurfaces in volume data using tedrahedrizations of an octree built from the WT. Additional tuning of the mesh could also be carried out by using the directional selectivity of the WT. : Level-of-detail meshing using wavelet space filtering: (C: remaining coefficients, z no. of triangles) a) a,=20, ay=20,0=0, C=1.31%, T=9943. b) a,=40, uj=lO, O=O, C=1.22%, T=9236. c)oX=40,ay=10, 0=1.5, C=l.ll%, T=9499. d) a,=20, u,=20,0=0, C=1.31%, T=9943.</p></div>
