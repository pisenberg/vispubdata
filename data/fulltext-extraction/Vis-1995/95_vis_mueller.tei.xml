				<p>A general framework for visualization of statistical properties of high-dimensional pat tern samples and the related computational steps are introduced. These procedures are exemplified on applications in anthropometrical research (shape information in faces) but can be easily generalized to various other morphometrical questions and data sets with pattern structure, e.g., data stemming from sensor arrays. Presently, the visualization techniques illustrated concentrate on (higher) moments of first order. It is suggested, how moments of second order can be visualized by animations and how this approach can be used in the context of comparative visualization.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction and general framework</head><p>In a number of scientific fields, a central research problem may be generally formulated as follows: Given a sample of observations X = <ref type="bibr">(z', . . . , &amp;, . . . , zN)</ref> where xk <ref type="bibr">= (x5,. . .,$, . . .,tk)</ref>,xk E SM and are drawn randomly from some distribution F, compute a statistics S(X) unfolding central characteristics of X, or 3, resp. It is well known, that standard methods of descriptive or inferential statistics provide the computation of the estimates of the moments m (or cumulants K) of T.</p><p>The interpretation of such numerical results, however, is cumbersome, if the number of dimensions, M, is very large. This is usually the case, if the observations x are patterns, i.e., stemming from a sensor array with A4 = M, x MY (e.g., digital images). In this case often an alignment transformation T : !RM H gZM is afforded in a primary step.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2' := Txk</head><p>This kind of preprocessing is necessary in order to compensate for viewpoint variability resulting from certain properties of the sampling procedure. In this way the statistics is computed on S(z) rather then on the untransformed S(X) in the second step (Note, that T is the identity transformation, if there is no viewpoint variability). If S(X) is choosen such that its numerical results are elements of RM a visualization of these numerical results is directly possible. A simple condition for such a 'pictorial statistics' is that the moments, or equivalently, the cumulants are of first order, m", K" E ?RM where ml is the mean vector of 2, its j-th element contains the mean value of all patterns at position j, m2 is the vector of standard deviations, m3 the vector of skewnesses, m4 of curtoises etc. In order to visualize such numerical results the real values of each vector element have to be mapped on a grey scale (or on pseudo colors) in the final step. Since values &lt; 0, &gt; 0 of m" represent different statistical aspects for v &gt; 2, visualizations of such moments should be done separetly. Let us now exemplify the more general formulation given above and its implications for the suggested visualization techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Examples from anthropometry and face processing</head><p>An important question for a number of scientific disciplines dealing with the morphometrical structure of (natural) objects, i.e., their shape information, is the following [4,51: Are there morphometrically defined classes such that there is an optimal (prototypical) class representation? In this case this representation should be expressed by a characteristic distribution of shape information: the exemplars of this class should follow a multivariate normal distribution around the prototype, since the genetic variations in the exemplars operate only randomly <ref type="bibr">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr">6]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Mean vector (centroid) of a pattern sample</head><p>In order to simplify the argumentation, we will exemplify this question on an anthropometrical approach to the morphology of faces since everyday knowledge about these objects is available. Moreover, all faces are recorded by frontal projection (canonical views) such that the transformation T, which is necessary to compensate for viewpoint variability in the primary step, reduces to translations and rotations in the plane and scale transformations <ref type="bibr">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">6]</ref>. In figure 1 prototypes of a distribution of male faces, ape faces and cars are shown (N = 30 in each sample). Such prototypes can be numerically computed as the (estimated) mean vector (centroid) of the distributions in the second step and finally visualized by grey scales [1,2,6]. In figure 1, the car centroid has less sharp boundaries and is thus more difficult to recognize as a car than the ape centroid with the human prototype best. In the latter distribution all features (except the hair, see below) are normally distributed resulting in a centroid visualization, which can be easily identified as a face. This gives a first strong evidence, that the morphometric structure of faces differs by random genetic variations centered around a prototype.</p><p>In contrast, in distributions of man-made products like cars of different types very different morphological organization principles operate. Hence an optimal class representation by a centroid is not plausible, which is confirmed by the visualization.</p><p>Note, however, that the contrary is expected, if a distribution of the same artificial objects (e.g., a certain chip) is generated by some production process. If the errors in that process operate randomly (following a Gauss-distribution) the resulting centroid, stemming, for instance, from a sample of microscopic images in quality control, will approach the theoretical optimum, i.e., the exact geometry of that chip. If a distribution of images is multivariate normal and thus m1 an optimal representant of the central tendency, edge detection and the transformation to a vector coding should be very easy, since such centroids have maximum deg,rees of (bilateral) symmetry and smooth intensity gradients <ref type="bibr">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">6</ref>]. (cf. figure 2, for an example of female faces and LaPlacian edge detector).   Hence there is evidence, that the 'anger'-expression is generated in systematically different ways. In contrast, for 'joy' seems to exist an unitary mode of expression with just random deviations in the sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Standard Deviation of a pattern distribution</head><p>More detailed statistical informations can be obtained by visualizations of higher moments of the distribution. The plot of the standard deviations, mapped to a grey scale or pseudo colors, allows a rapid insight in the sources of variation (or standard errors, resp.) in the different Proceedings of the 6th IEEE Visualization Conference <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(VISUALIZATION '95)</ref> 1070-2385/95 $10.00 © 1995 IEEE spatial regions of a pattern distribution.</p><p>As illustrated in figure 4 (N = 16 female faces), darker regions correspond to large variations, which exhibits, that in these regions both low and high intensity values are present (resulting from faces with short and long hair). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Skewness of a pattern distribution</head><p>Even more interesting is the spatial distribution of moments mu for u &gt; 2 since they approach zero in a normal distribution. In the example of figure 5 (same sample as above) it is evident, that the inner facial features have lower values of ]m3] and are thus normally distributed, which confirms the interpretation of genetic random deviations given in section 2.1. The outer facial features, on the other hand, show remarkable differences from a normal distribution. This is a plausible result, since hair styles are determined by sociological influences (e.g., fashions), rather than by biological processes. Moreover, only a small number of portraits has very short hair, which leads to left-skewed distributions in the 'short hair'-regions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">figure 5, left)</ref>. On the other hand, the dark right-skewed grey codings emerge in the 'long hair'-regions, since only a small number of portraits have long hair (figure 5, right).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Curtoises of a pattern distribution</head><p>Besides the rapid identification of areas of skewed distributions pointing at outliers, furt.her deviations from a normal distribution can be detected by visualizing the shape of the distribution around the mean as numerically expressed by the curtoises. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref> (sample as above) confirms the previous result, that higher moments vanish in the inner facial features. Deviations from a normal distribution, again, occur only in the hair-area. The distribution is sharp in the 'long hair'-region (low mean intensity values) and in the 'short hair'-region (high mean intensity values) with a few outliers: portraits with very long and very short hair, resp. (figure 6, right). A flat shape of the distribution can be seen in the 'medium hair'-region (figure 6, left).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.5</head><p>Extrema of a pattern distribution The visualization of the multivariate extrema Pax / min provides an insight in the spatial distribution of the total variation in a pattern sample. These extrema may be considered as the point-wise fuzzy union and intersection of 2, which contains patterns measured in the Hamming space as special cases <ref type="bibr">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5]</ref>. The difference image zdiff := rmax -,#" visualizes the range of the distribution as an alternative measure of variation.</p><p>3 Results and further applications The a.pproach presented provides an rapid insight in central aspects of high-dimensional statistical distributions of complex objects or, more precisely, their digitized images. The visualization of moments of these distributions can clarify important morphometrical questions, such as whether exemplars are random deviations of an optimal class representation, the prototype.</p><p>This question has received a lot of attention, for instance, in the face processing literature <ref type="bibr">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr">6]</ref>. The results obtained so far yield strong evidences, that the inner facial features are, in contrast to the more sociologically determined outer features, in fact normally distributed. It has been exemplified, that a surprisingly small sample size is sufficient to establish these evidences. Hence all procedures described may be run on simple hardware and are not very time consuming. However, more complicated statistical analysis is afforded for a numerical confirmation of a 'pictorial statistics' in the general case, such as measures of convergence properties and stability of the estimators [S]. It is evident, that this approach is not limited to the structure of faces but may be fruitful1 in a variety of morphometrical applications. Moreover, as already mentioned, a further possible field of application is quality control: the deviations of a series of objects from the (mathematical) model and the characteristica of the corresponding error distribution can be visualized. This statistical approach can be further used as a method of comparative visualization of distributions of residuals from the theoret.ical model or of differences between two or more samples. In the latter case statistical measures (e.g., multivariate t-values) are visualized as deviations instead of simple difference images of the mean vectors. Note, however, that such measures rely on certain statistical assumptions, which can be easily visualized with the methods explained above. Distribution-free estimators for pattern distributions, based on bootstrap techniques, are given in <ref type="bibr">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">3]</ref>, where the relevance for object recognition is discussed as well. The suggested visualization techniques are presently limited to moments of first order. However, second order moments, such as the covariance matrix of the observations, may be visualized by animations as follows: The patterns are segmented in c lines and for each line the mean covariances with all other lines are compu-ted. These Iresults are coded in grey scales as above and presented as c frames, such that the animation shows a sequential screening of all the elements of the covariance matrix in an appropriate spatial order. Finally, a 'pictorial statistics' may inspire artists in creating artifici.al images out of natural ones. In fact, the combination of images, now popular as 'morphing', is the special case for N = 2 and certain non-linear coordinate transformations T. As has been shown, it is not difficult to construct a variety of artificial images from a distribution of natural ones <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(figures 1,3,7)</ref>. Interestingly, an artificial face prototype (centroid) is judged more attractive than 'real' faces <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr">5]</ref>. Further possibilities include, for instance, the incorporation of other measures of central tendencies. Clearly, all such artificial images will become even nicer and more realistic, if N ---f co.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Centroids m1 of a sample of female faces, ape faces and cars</figDesc></figure>
