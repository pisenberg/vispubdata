			<abstract>
				<p>A software architecture is presented to integrate a database management system with data visualization. One ofits primary objectives, the retention of user-data interaclions, is detailed. By storing all queries over the data along with high-level descriptions of the query results and the associated visualization, the processes by which a database is explored can be analyzed. This approach can lead to important contributions in the development of user models as &quot;data explorers&quot;, metadata models for scientific databases, intelligent assistants and data exploration services. We describe the underlying elements of this approach, specifically the visual database exploration model and the metadata objects that support the model.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Accessing the wealth of information embedded in large and complex databases is a serious problem facing data visualization software systems. These systems are hard pressed to accommodate the interactive exploration of high dimensional (often nonspatial) data typically found in databases because they have limited data and metada.ta selection capabilities. When database size greatly exceeds available memory and data dimensionality surpasses effective visualization approaches, data subsetting becomes critical to select relevant data and ultimately reduce data for further investigation. We envision a paradigm shift towards integrated database management-data visualization systems to address these problems by tightly coupling associative data selection with visualization. Important considerations are how to define the integration and how a user explores a database given database and visualization tools.</p><p>In this paper we present the portion of a software architecture called Exbase (Exploration of Databases) that serves as the interface between an extended relational database management system (DBMS) and a visualization system. The Exbase kernel is an object-oriented mediary that performs the "impedance match" between the respective type systems and data models, manages metadata objects and maintains user interactions with the database, visualization, and system parameters. Any stored data object can be queried because the DBMS mediates all data access. In Section 2 we outline related work. In Section 3 we describe the visual database exploration model. The architecture's metadata components are described in Section 4. In Section 5 we discuss visual database exploration retention and analysis. We summarize the important aspects of our approach in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>Our research encompasses three domains: integrated DBMS-visualization systems, metadata models, and user modeling and monitoring.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Database-Visualization Systems</head><p>Most of the relevant DBMS-visualization research is being driven by the database community. Several prototype implementations focus on global change research <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">10,</ref><ref type="bibr">20]</ref>. Others relate to medical databases [l, 61 and large-scale numerical simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[9]</ref>. Many of these projects utilize dataflow graphical front ends and 3D graphics for visualization, and extended-relational or object-oriented DBMSs to model and manage numeric, image and geometric data. Some, such as Sequoia 2000 <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref>, mnintain the DBMS as the central repository for all system objects and data processing operations. Others, such as ptool <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[9]</ref>, utilize a streamlined, high-performance object store with minimal DBMS functions. Most others exist between these two extremes, trying to balance modeling, expressiveness, associative data retrieval and ease of use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Metadata Models</head><p>Metadata is a knowledge representation that describes the data stored in a database. Metadata for a commercial relational database includes primitive data types, their locations, organizations and user access privileges. Metadata for visualization systems requires a richer data description for data types such as multidimensional arrays and nested structures, and statistics on data variables for use in subsequent analysis. Formal visualization metadata models are still a research topic. The conceptual model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[13]</ref>  This prior research points out the important fact that metadata is an evolving entity, essential in encapsulating the structural, user, process and environmental components of a database exploration. Metadata is often inserted back into the database, contrary to the notion that data for visualization is read-only.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">User Modeling and Monitoring</head><p>User modeling and monitoring is required to determine how a database is explored, the portions visited, the operation sequences, and ultimately the patterns between operations and visualizations. Prior research has done little to quantify and exploit this user cognitive component. Efforts to date have focused on fundamental issues in categorizing data analysis and visualization interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr">19,</ref><ref type="bibr">221</ref> and constructing visualizations automatically <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">12,</ref><ref type="bibr">181</ref>. User monitoring can be accomplished by direct interaction analysis <ref type="bibr">[14, 16, 191,</ref>  Automated monitoring is required for the implementation of adaptive systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">A Conceptual Visual Database Exploration Model</head><p>At its simplest, a visual database exploration is a visu'alization of a database query result. Based on the visualization, the user then issues new queries and constructs new visualizations as the exploration sessiorz continues. We now present a visual database exploration conceptual model to describe these sessions and enable their retention and analysis. We use a graphical notation for demonstration: boxes denote data subsets, inverted triangles denote images, and arrows denote interaction processes. After defining the fundamental processes, the user component is incorporated to extend the model. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Fundamental Processes</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Incorporating the User</head><p>The Visualization is used to determine how to proceed with the investigation, as the user focuses in on the relevant portions of the database. Based on the Visualization, the user might change the visualization transform components (r , m, or s), or alter the next query (I and c). The Visualization might even participate in the composition of the next query, as in sketching a region of interest within an image for further investigation. These processes extend the basic model, and are shown in Figures 3a and 3b represent simple changes to the explor,ation -more restrictive query conditions over the same target attributes, or changes in visualization display settings. The visualization representation and mappings remain constant. This is equivalent to "fine-tuning" a retrieval or VisWlization as the focus marrows. Figures 3c and 3d represent more significant changes to the exploration. This may meLan navigation to a new portion of the database, or the use of a new visualization representation or mapping strategy to gain insight into the data. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3e</ref> shows that two database subsets can be merged into a single subset. This is equivalent to combining the two queries that created the subsets. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">VDE Session Diagrams</head><p>If we envision an "exploration space" consisting of these aggregate structures, we can then begin to reason about how the database is explored. As these structures are combined during exploration sessions, they form a temporally ordered directed graph structure, the VDE Session Diagram of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>. This model breaks a linear sequence of data interactions into a two-dimensional hierarchical structure. The horizontal axis represents focusing interactions (minor changes to queries and visualizations), and the vertical axis exploratory interactions (new data subsets and visualizations). Thus, In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>, we show three Visual Database Exploration sequences having sequential and branching structures. We omit labeling of database subsets and Visualizations for clarity. VDEt undergoes visualization settings change before a query with new targets starts VDE2. VDE2 undergoes data conditional restriction, visualization settings change, and visualization representation chringe before the query conditional is changed to create VDE3. VDE3 undergoes three mapping changes, one of which is explored further by a data restriction, subset merging, and visualization settings change.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Exbase Metadata Components</head><p>The VDE session components are metadata since they describe how the user explores the database. Thus, we must model each component in the DBMS and Exbase kernel. The general Exbase architecture has been described elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[15]</ref>. TheExbase kernel is an objcctoriented design that manages transient versions of metadata objects, retrieved data subsets, and VDE Exbase is DBMS independent, requiring an interface to be written for each particular database system it accesses. One interface currently exists to the OrionTM extended relational DBMS <ref type="bibr">[23]</ref>. Orion can model sets, multidimensional arrays and references, which makes it suitable to our application data sets. Discussing the various DBMS tradeoffs and interface details are beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>Exbase currently manages three persistent types of metadata: Identification, Structural and Process metadata, logically organized into a tree rooted at a single identification node, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>. There is one secondary Structural metadata type, the QueryResult, that is not persistent, but incorporated into the Process metadata. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Identification Metadata</head><p>Identification metadata describes the entire database, having attributes which include its name, creator, principal investigator and contact number, date of data creation and entry into the DBMS, and a number of links to structural and process metadata objects. Identification metadata is queried to find a particular database given high level specifications.</p><p>We can migrate other descriptive attributes from embedded component objects in the future, depending on how users need to identify a database. The DBMS counterpart is a single table with links to all of the valid tables, attributes, categories and exploration sessions of the database. Identification metadata is also used within each metadata object.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Structural Metadata</head><p>Structural me&amp;data describes the orgauization of data objects. We differentiate two types of structural metadata: primary and secondary. The primary Exbase structural metadata classes describe the base data in the database and includes database tables, attributes and categories.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table class</ref> for a QueryResult now contain metadata describing the attributes of the QueryResult. All statistical parameters such as means, deviations, ranges and frequencies now reflect the contents of the data subset. This class is typically not interacted with by the user: it is meant as a service for the Exbase kernel only. There is no database counterpart because this object describes a memoryresident object, and all relevant information is stored in the Query object (described below) that created the QueryResult.  <ref type="table">Query table will contain interleaved</ref> queries from many users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Process Metadata</head><p>The Visualization metadata class describes the visualization transform applied to a QueryResult (and therefore a Query) object. A Visualization is a type of view into the database, analogous to the concept of a database view, but not yet having a formal definition of properties and allowable operations. Visualization class members include attributes of the Query object that are displayed, the representation technique used, the mapping between data values and visualization primitives and the display parameters. Devising an inheritance hierarchy for visualization techniques (as in [S]) is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>An important note is that a (portion of a) visualization can be used in a database query as part of the conditional predicate. By having the Query object available, the original data values driving the visualization in a region of interest can be easily acquired, and those values can then be used in the new query to guide the data selection. This leads to some interesting possibilities for querying databases directly through visualizations. The database counterpart consists of a table with these attributes and a single link to a Query object, as there can only be one query for a particular visualization.</p><p>En route to satisfying the goals of the exploration, queries and visualizations are refined, as described in Section 3. The Session metadata class encapsulates this notion by managing collections of query-visualization sequences which could have internal linear or branching structures of arbitrary complexity. The DBMS counterpart table contains sets of references to persistent query and visualization objects. Because a query contains a description of its result, we store a Query object in place of the QueryResult in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>, and in the database representation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Metadata Usage in Practice</head><p>In this section, we describe how the metadata is used in the capture, storage and analysis of user-data interactions. This architecture is currently managing databases in financial, human genome and space science domains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">VDE Retention</head><p>During a visual database exploration, a number of metadata objects are created, retrieved and inserted into the database. When a database is opened, the entire metadata structure ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>) is loaded into the Exbase kernel. Portions of this metadata is made available for the user to compose queries through the database user interface. Once the metadata is loaded, the user can then start a new session or restart a stored session from the DBMS. Any point in the tree structure of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> can be retrieved, not just the most recent point or a named file. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref> shows a portion of the Exbase kernel, along with the primary metadata objects and data flow describing query preprocessing and retention during a query-visualization sequence.</p><p>The basic functions of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref> are the construction of a query, its result set, an appropriate visualization, and a visual database exploration entry for the session graph. Once Database Me&amp;data is made available, the steps in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref> proceed in a somewhat clockwise fashion: 1) A query is created at the Database User Interface and sent to the Session Manager.</p><p>2) Structural metadata is used to extract Process metadata from the query. A partially complete VDE object is created.</p><p>3) The query is passed to the Database Interface where it might be altered based on the availability of memory-resident data.</p><p>4) The query is issued to the DBMS, and a database subset result returned. 9) The complete Visual Database Exploration object is inserted into the Session graph.</p><p>10) The VDE is then made persistent by being inserted into the DBMS.</p><p>Because our description of the visual database exploration process has many components, our implementation requires cooperation from a number of system modules. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref> shows that metadata stored in the database is required by most system modules to perform their duties, is created by the application and inserted back into the DBMS, to become part of the database description.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">VDE Analysis</head><p>The Exbase metadata is managed by an architecture which in its simplest mode provides user session histories. Users can retrace their steps to and from any point in any session, by "replaying" session segments. This is useful to analyze individual approaches to the exploration process, or to explain an exploration technique. Thus, the lowest level support provided by the metadata is for presentations that analyze the complete data exploration process.</p><p>Having the DBMS present simplifies more complex analyses. Analyses take the form of database (or rather metadutabase) queries, and can be arbitrarily complex. The user can ask: "what queries were involved to get to this point, and what portion of the database am I looking at?', "did I look at this subset anywhere else in any of my previous sessions?", "what visualization representations, mappings and settings have been particularly useful for this database", or "what data subsets exists with statistics similar to the subset I am currently viewing?', without much difficulty. Because we rely on the DBMS and not the file system to manage our data, such probing questions can be asked of both data and the metadata An important issue affecting VDE analysis is metadata size. For large, complex databases, we expect the metadata to grow rapidly as more users explore it and more operations are performed. One approach to this problem is to provide user directed encapsulation tools, where the user can "tag" an important visualization or database subset. Once tagged, the system can then trace its evolution back to the database, extract the exploration path, compress it, and remove all other parts of the visual data exploration subgraph. This is similar to creating a database view in the DBMS literature. Thus, tagging in this case is a request for intelligent context saving. Users can then explore the tagged "discoveries" for similarities or patterns. At this point, the user is building meta-session information, and can gain insight into the data exploration process. Queries here are expressed over interactions, query results, visualizations and session archives.</p><p>When multiple users access the same database, the advantages of this dynamic metadata stand out. The metadata contains session information for all users, and the DBMS can handle all security issues transparently, once properly initialized. A user can explore other approaches to the visualization of a database, and apply those methods in his own process space by selecting session start and end points. Groupware applications can use the metadata to explore multi-user systems in a uniform fashion, and support operations in these environments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>By integrating DBMS technology with visualization, data exploration sessions (and therefore the user of such systems) can be modeled and analyzed in a consistent fashion. This approach permits formal data management for all of the data objects inherent to the visualization process, as well as the process itself. Additionally, harnessing the knowledge retained about the sequence of queries and visualizations that chronicle the exploration of a database will lead to advances in data retrieval for integrated DBMS-visualization systems, similar to the benefits of caching for virtual memory management.</p><p>The concepts and implementation we present here are a step towards realizing such systems. We have introduced a model of the visual data exploration process, created a number of new metadata objects to encapsulate identification, structural and process portions of this model, and have shown how this metadata is used within an integrated DBMS-visualization system. From this research, we hope to draw up recommendations and guidelines to enable the migration of these ideas into next-generation database and visualization systems.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>AFigure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>visual database exploration (VDE) is composed of a database subset D,, two primary processes: a database query q and a visualization transform v, and a single perceptual component: a visualization Vp. The basic structures are shown in Figure 1. VDE structures Figure lc is analogous to the popular "visualization pipeline" model, with data selection represented by a database query. A database query function q: DO -+ D, is a pair (t. c), where t is a set of targets that identify the database attributes to be retrieved, and c is a Boolean conditional containing relational expressions over t that restrict the retrieval. The query result D, is a subset of the database DO. A visualization transform function v: D,-+ VP is a triple (r, m, s), where r is a representation scheme (point, surface, volume, iconograplic, etc.), m is a mapping between query targets and visual display primitives, and s is a specification of the display settings (representation, viewing, lighting, shading, etc.). The resulting Visualization VP plays a maj'or role in guiding the exploration, serving as a decision point for subsequent interactions.</figDesc></figure>
