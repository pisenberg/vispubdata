<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The MAP Tracking System</head><p>The ocean is a turbid lens for a marine biologist studying marine mammals. Marine mammals are tied to the surface by their need to breath, but spend most of their time underwater traveling on migrations, foraging, and socializing. A new self-contained tracking system has been developed which records their underwater movements in three dimensions and accurately fixes the location of each surfacing. This movement and position (MAP) tag is composed of a GPS receiver, a U-i-axial magnetometer, a pressure transducer, a velocity meter, a thermistor and a micro-processor controlled datalogger. When deployed it is attached to the animal and later recovered.</p><p>The location of each surfacing is fixed within meters from the GPS data and the underwater movement is reconstructed by dead reckoning using the three element vector (heading, roll and pitch) provided by the magnetometer, distance of each segment by averaging velocity over time from the velocity meter, and cross checked with depth from the pressure transducer. When attached to an elephant seal the MAP tag provides 3 to 10 locations an hour and a detailed description of its diving behavior. This is in sharp contrast to the best previous syslems which obtained 1 to 10 locations a day, accurate to within kilometers, and only rudimentary dive information, e.g. changes in depth with time and velocity. Old ways of looking at the data are inadequate for interpretation of data from the MAP tag.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Visualizing MAP System Data</head><p>To resolve this difficulty, while developing the hardware for the MAP tag we created a theoretical output file and designed methods of visualizing the data. This data set represents the path of an elephant seal traveling across Monterey Bay. Spray rendering <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> was used to visualize these data. The GPS locations of surfacings can be overlaid on an aerial view of Monterey Bay and connected using the underwater headings. By concurrently loading a bathymetric file of Monterey Bay and the MAP data we can see how the track of the seal is influenced by the shape of the Monterey Canyon. By changing Ithe angle of view, the path changes from a two dimensional perspective to a three dimensional one, showing both the surfacing locations and the dive profiles as they relate to the bathfrmetry of the Bay (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1)</ref>. Exaggeration of the vertical scale enhances this perspective. The view can continue to be rotated. Zooming in on specific parts of the path is possible, allowing the biologist to look in detail at what the seal did. The lpath can also be stepped through following the seal second by second through a dive or series of dives. The path can be color coded to represent changes in water temperature encountered by the seal as it dives (graded from red to blue to represent the warmer water near shore and at the surface and the coldest water encountered at depth as inI <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Visualizing Uncertainty in MAP System Data</head><p>In any data set there is some uncertainty, and the greatest uncertainty in MAP tag data is that relating to the path between GPS locations. In the theoretical data set, the seal maintained a constant heading between surfacing. We calculated the path moving forward through time and therefore uncertainty increases along the path, and reaches its maximum at the end of the dive. As the seal surfaces a new GPS fix is obtained, and the dead reckoning of the next portion of the path starts at that location, thus the 1070-2385/95 $4.00 0 1995 IEEE (See color plates, page CP.52) uncertainty from the previous dive is not carried forward. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> of the seal track across Monterey Bay this uncertainty can be seen by the horizontal lines (marked by arrows) at the surface which end at the next the GPS location. We can change the location of the maximum uncertainty in at least two ways. First, we can dead reckon backwards from the GPS position at the end of a dive; this will place the maximum uncertainty at the beginning of the dive. Second, by dead reckoning both forwards and backwards and then by comparing them, the maximum uncertainty is encountered in the middle of the dive rather than at either end. Real data however reveal that underwater changes of heading are common. Thus, the calculation of the underwater path becomes much more complicated, and uncertainty increases. We desire to have both a quantitative and a visual display of the uncertainty. One method we are testing is to regard the path as a cone with the width of the cone representing the degree of uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Displaying that uncertainty and providing means of measuring it are critical to me as the biologist interpreting the data, and will be an active focus of our research in the next few months.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biological Implications</head><p>Moving from theoretical data to data collected on free ranging seals we find insights into many aspects of marine mammal ecology. Two examples are foraging ecology and navigation. 1) We know that elephant seals forage in the deep scattering layer and that their foraging dives show a characteristic series of vertical wiggles at the bottom of the each dive <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref>. We presume these wiggles relate to their chasing prey, however we do not know if they are feeding on schooled prey or isolated individuals. Visualization of the path the seal follows between these wiggles could clarify this. We expect when chasing schooled prey the wiggles will be connected by a circular path, whereas when chasing more widely dispersed individual prey items. the wiggles will be connected by a random walklike pattern. Average patch size can also be estimated from these visualizations. 2) On migration and when departing and returning to their rookeries, elephant seals have another characteristic dive. It is V shaped with the descending portion being less steeply angled than the ascending portion <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref>. How these seals navigate is a complete mystery, but again visualization of the MAP data can provide new insights. Where major course changes occur in these dives can point out which sensory cues are being utilized. Reliance upon their visual system for cues (e.g., celestial navigation and visual sightings of the coastline) would result in major course changes occurring at or immediately after surfacing, whereas reliance upon their acoustic system (which is more sensitive underwater than in air) would show course changes occurring underwater. As the data accumulate, the ocean's inherent turbidity to marine biologists will be reduced and our view clarified by visualization.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Visualization of a theoretical path of a Monterey Canyon is indicated by shading, the shoreline by the green linie, and land by black.The surfacing locations are indicated by yellow balls and the underwater path is represented by the lines connecting the balls.</figDesc></figure>
