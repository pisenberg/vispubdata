			<abstract>
				<p>Understanding and accounting for uncertainty is critical to effectively reasoning about visualized data. However, evaluating the impact of an uncertainty visualization is complex due to the difficulties that people have interpreting uncertainty and the challenge of defining correct behavior with uncertainty information. Currently, evaluators of uncertainty visualization must rely on general purpose visualization evaluation frameworks which can be ill-equipped to provide guidance with the unique difficulties of assessing judgments under uncertainty. To help evaluators navigate these complexities, we present a taxonomy for characterizing decisions made in designing an evaluation of an uncertainty visualization. Our taxonomy differentiates six levels of decisions that comprise an uncertainty visualization evaluation: the behavioral targets of the study, expected effects from an uncertainty visualization, evaluation goals, measures, elicitation techniques, and analysis approaches. Applying our taxonomy to 86 user studies of uncertainty visualizations, we find that existing evaluation practice, particularly in visualization research, focuses on Performance and Satisfaction-based measures that assume more predictable and statistically-driven judgment behavior than is suggested by research on human judgment and decision making. We reflect on common themes in evaluation practice concerning the interpretation and semantics of uncertainty, the use of confidence reporting, and a bias toward evaluating performance as accuracy rather than decision quality. We conclude with a concrete set of recommendations for evaluators designed to reduce the mismatch between the conceptualization of uncertainty in visualization versus other fields.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Data-driven presentations have become commonplace in public-facing domains like the news as well as in the scientific literature. A newspaper article might depict differences in the probabilities of a set of political candidates winning an election. A government agency might present future temperature predictions of a model analyzing climate change trends. By conveying the possibility that a point estimate may vary, uncertainty visualizations enable people to make more informed decisions. As public trust in science declines <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and overconfidence in noisy effects reportedly affects a number of empirical disciplines <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, uncertainty visualizations are more important than ever.</p><p>It is the task of research in uncertainty visualization to provide evidence of the impacts of proposed uncertainty visualization techniques, so as to inform practice. However, how to design an effective evaluation of an uncertainty visualization is rarely addressed in research focused on creating uncertainty representations. A researcher or practitioner seeking to evaluate a visualization with users must instead rely on general purpose frameworks designed to ensure that evaluation designs are appropriate given the nature of the visualization contribution (algorithmic, interaction technique, encoding, etc.) <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67]</ref>.</p><p>Recently, scholars have pointed to the challenges evaluating uncertainty visualizations compared to evaluating other visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">79]</ref>. For example, researchers in judgment and decision making describe eliciting and analyzing subjective accounts of uncertainty as a process fraught with its own uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>, though the difficulty of uncertainty elicitation is seldom considered in studies of uncertainty visualization. Statisticians and other scholars have long debated how to define normative accounts of uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">83]</ref>; without clear agreement on what uncertainty is, it is difficult to imagine an agreed upon approach to evaluating uncertainty comprehen- sion. Canonical work on judgment under uncertainty argues that people display cognitive biases when making decisions involving uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>. Historically, such biases have been attributed to heuristics, the use of simple judgments as a proxy for difficult judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">90,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">91,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">92]</ref>. A common misconception is that reliance on heuristics is bound to cause biased judgments. On the contrary, heuristics are adaptive and often lead to accurate judgments. In the context of evaluating uncertainty visualizations, this means that even when uncertainty is presented in a non-optimal format-such as error bars, which lead to perceptual bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> and underweighting of uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>-responses based on heuristics will sometimes be correct. Consequently, it can be difficult to create the conditions in which heuristics are flawed and cognitive biases occur. In the face of these and other unique evaluation challenges, the integrity of our knowledge on how to best visualize uncertainty is at stake.</p><p>We take a closer look at the evaluation of uncertainty visualizations through the largest to date systematic review of existing uncertainty visualization practice. We survey the techniques used in 86 uncertainty visualization evaluations published between 1987 to 2018 in a variety of disciplines. Our first contribution is a taxonomy for distinguishing between uncertainty visualization evaluation approaches <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2</ref>). Our taxonomy distinguishes key considerations at six levels of decisions comprising an uncertainty evaluation approach. Behavioral Targets describe what aspects of the impact of uncertainty visualization(s) on user behavior are examined, such as its impact on Performance or the Quality of User Experience. Expected Effects describe how a study defines when an uncertainty visualization is successful or not. Evaluation Goals pertain to the study design: was the goal to Compare multiple visualizations, Determine the impact of presenting uncertainty versus not, or another goal? Measures include directly elicited measures such as satisfaction ratings, probability estimates, subjective confidence, etc. as well as derived measures representing transformations such as error, or the extent to which a decision maximizes utility. Elicitation describes ways that users' responses can be gathered, from use of a physical apparatus to common HTML inputs. Analysis describes how an evaluator uses responses to determine if Expected Effects were achieved, such as Frequentist Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) or Bayesian Estimation, for example.</p><p>Our second contribution is an analysis of evaluation paths, where we compare the co-occurance of codes for 86 evaluation studies across the different levels of our taxonomy. For example a common evaluation path describes a Behavioral Target (L1) of Performance with an Expected Effect (L2) of Increasing Accuracy, conducted by (L3) Comparing the Impacts of Multiple Visualizations through a Measure (L4) of participant's Probability estimates from which Error is derived, which are Elicited (L5) via a Slider and Analyzed (L6) using a Frequentist NHST approach <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1)</ref>. We find that existing evaluation practice, particularly in Visualization research, focuses on comparing multiple uncertainty visualizations to one another using a small number of Performance and Satisfaction-based measures elicited using constrained inputs such as multiple choice or Likert-style responses. These studies implicitly assume that correct responses are arrived at using procedures that resemble statistical decision making, that people's meta-cognitive assessments of how effective an uncertainty visualization is are reliable, and that elicitation techniques are mostly interchangable without affecting responses.</p><p>Our final contribution is a set of recommendations designed to encourage more transparent evaluations aligned with the state of the art in knowledge on uncertainty comprehension. Our results confirm and extend recent recommendations made by others <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>. We describe how evaluators tend to interpret subjective uncertainty in several incompatible ways, as either directly comparable to statistical uncertainty or as an inherently subjective meta-cognitive assessment of confidence. We describe what lessons can be learned from formal analyses of decision making and subjective uncertainty using techniques from experimental economics, psychophysics, and judgment and decision making. We highlight the potential for decision-based approaches to enable more realistic evaluations relative to accuracy or efficiency, the value of evaluations that aim to understand why visualizations produce different behavior, and the value of including no uncertainty and textual controls as a means of developing a deeper base of knowledge around the impacts of uncertainty visualization, among others.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Improving Visualization Evaluation</head><p>Our work extends a larger body of work aimed at improving evaluation methods in visualization. Researchers have contributed overviews of qualitative and quantitative approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">94]</ref> and models for ensuring that one selects an evaluation that is appropriate for a given task, context, or contribution type <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">84]</ref>. For example, Munzner's well known Nested Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> stresses the dependencies between stages of the design process (e.g., characterizing the task and data, designing visual encodings), where an error at one stage can affect subsequent stages. Our taxonomy similarly distinguishes between different "stages" of decisions in the design of evaluations for uncertainty visualizations.</p><p>Several prior works describe trends in evaluation in the visualization community through systematic review of studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>). Lam et al. use a review of 361 visualization papers to contribute a set of scenarios describing the most common goals and outputs of different forms of evaluation. Their work takes a broad view that evaluation can occur at any stage in a design process. Isenberg et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> borrow from Lam et al.'s <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> codes in a review of 581 papers that evaluate the impacts of visualizations on users.</p><p>We restrict our review to studies that correspond to Lam et al.'s scenarios for understanding visualization: formal studies conducted to determine a visualization's effects. Similar to both prior works, we include a distinction between evaluations that target Performance versus User Experience. Additionally, in our taxonomy we include a third type of behavioral target of Semantics and Interpretation of uncertainty depictions which we observed in multiple studies. Because the goal of our taxonomy is to surface intended goals and evaluation designs for uncertainty information, we employ a more detailed coding scheme than these prior surveys. For example, in contrast to the reviews of Lam et al. and Isenberg et al., which used a total of 17 and 8 codes respectively, we employ a coding scheme comprised of 72 total codes distributed across six different levels of evaluation design decisions (3 to 18 codes per level).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Evaluating Uncertainty Visualization</head><p>Various standards boards and public-facing organizations have described the importance of conveying uncertainty as a component of scientific data <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">88]</ref>. Visualization researchers and cartographers have proposed a large number of techniques for visualizing uncertainty, which can be classified using various taxonomies <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">86,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">89]</ref>. We have observed that few studies used to validate new techniques motivate the evaluation design against alternatives, in addition to providing sufficient information for understanding a presented study (i.e., detailing the questions posed to participants, the participant sample, and how the measures were calculated). This aligns with Kinkeldey et al.'s <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> observation that few of 44 cartographic uncertainty visualization evaluations justified their tasks.</p><p>Some researchers have commented on the unique aspects of evaluation of uncertainty visualization. Harrower <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> argues that evaluators should be more concerned with "does it help" and less focused on "which vis is better," given the inherent complexity of uncertainty information. Boukhelifa and Duke <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> mention assessing how uncertainty information is used as one challenge in visualizing uncertainty, while Bonneau et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> distinguish three types of evaluations: theoretical evaluation using design principles (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[94]</ref>), low-level visual evaluation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>), and task oriented user study (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[82]</ref>).</p><p>Several recent papers comment on the challenges of designing a realistic uncertainty visualization evaluation while maintaining sufficient experimental control to test predictions <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">79]</ref>. Kinkeldey et al. summarize studies reported in 34 publications that describe an evaluation of how geospatial uncertainty visualizations communicate <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. In a follow up review on an overlapping set of 43 studies, the authors focus instead on assessing the impact of uncertainty visualization on decision-making and risk assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. These works characterize types of studies (e.g., laboratory, etc.), types of assessment (objective, involving correct answers, versus subjective, exploring user intuitions), types of uncertainty, visualization techniques examined, application domains, and participant and task characteristics. They note that in many cases evaluations focus on simplified, low-level visual judgment tasks, and appear to be designed in an ad hoc manner. They also find a tendency to measure decision-making rather than perceptions of risk, which we also observe in our larger sample. They recommend greater systematicity and focus on realistic user tasks.</p><p>Focusing on evaluation across visualization subfields, Hullman <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> summarizes patterns in a convenience sample of uncertainty visualization studies, characterizing study goals and types of measures. They review challenges to the epistemological nature of uncertainty, and provide specific suggestions related to eliciting subjective probability such as using frequency framings, familiar probability "anchors" (e.g., coin flips), and comparing multiple forms of elicitation.</p><p>Our taxonomy extends these prior classifications with a more comprehensive set of distinctions about decisions at each stage of visualization evaluation, informed by categories that emerged in our analysis as well as the state-of-the-art in judgment and decision making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">METHODS: CREATING THE TAXONOMY 3.1 Scope: Evaluative User Studies</head><p>To be included in our sample, we required that a study included at least one visual representation of uncertainty, and at least one research question concerning the impact of an uncertainty visualization on a user's performance, impressions, or behavior. The goal of these criteria was to eliminate, for example, studies focused on different forms of textual representations of uncertainty or different framings of uncertainty (e.g., frequency) that did not involve visualizations per se. Also eliminated were studies that presented uncertainty to viewers but without posing any research questions concerned with how visual representation of uncertainty impacted behavior or responses.</p><p>As user studies, each study necessarily included at least one means of eliciting responses or actions from users of a visualization. Our final criterion for inclusion was that each study included a quantitative analysis of users' responses or behaviors as impacted by a visualization. This criterion is meant to exclude studies that did not judge how prevalent or important different results are (i.e., studies that refrain completely from reporting on the frequency of different results, even textually through terms such as "most users"). Because we are interested in gaining a comprehensive view of available techniques for uncertainty visualization evaluation, we put no restrictions on the disciplinary venue where a study was published.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Sample</head><p>We seeded our list of publications containing evaluation studies with Potter's online library of uncertainty visualization studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>. This resource contains 241 publications presenting uncertainty visualization techniques or studies published between 1990 and 2013 in core venues associated with the research fields of InfoVis, SciVis, Cartography, Medicine, and Psychology, among others. The first author examined each of the 241 papers to remove those that did not contain evaluative user studies as defined above (leaving 48 studies). To identify studies from 2013 to the present, we used a set of queries containing methodological terms like "user study" or "controlled experiment" as well as indicators of uncertainty visualization like "uncertainty visualization", "uncertainty representation", "risk visualization", "graphical representation of risk", and "risk representation". We queried Google Scholar for each combination of method term and uncertainty visualization term. We manually went through each list of results, stopping when we reached an entire page (10 papers per page) of papers that were no longer relevant to uncertainty visualization. This resulted in an additional 52 studies (100 total). During the coding process, we eliminated 14 of these 100 studies as a result of not being able to obtain the paper or noticing a priori that a study did not fulfill one of our inclusion criteria (e.g., we removed an fMRI study where uncertainty visualizations were shown only to gauge how the brain reacts to uncertainty). <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> summarizes the number of studies by publication discipline and application domain. We created an initial "top-down" set of distinctions based on our own knowledge of procedures in visualization and related fields such as cognitive psychology. This basic taxonomy differentiated highlevel goals (e.g., "improving decision making"), intermediate goals (e.g., "improving accuracy in data extraction"), and evaluation designs (e.g., "comparing multiple uncertainty visualization treatments"). Implementation decisions were considered separately and were categorized based on what measure was elicited (e.g., a probability estimate), how it was elicited (e.g., a slider), and analyses approaches (e.g., Frequentist NHST). The taxonomy was prescriptive in that we included nodes for techniques that are recommended in literature on expert probability elicitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>, such as graphical elicitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and formal analyses of decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Coding Procedure</head><p>We next iteratively applied a "bottom-up" approach in which we assessed the approaches used in our sample. We isolated each measure in a study, tracing each distinct analytical comparison that was applied to this measure. We labeled the research question, expected effect, evaluation design, elicitation method, and analysis approach for each comparison (creating an "evaluation path"; e.g., <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>).</p><p>As we analyzed more studies, we periodically added new codes to our taxonomy and refined the distinctions between levels of the taxonomy. For example, we opted to reframe high-level study goals more specifically as Behavioral Targets, and intermediate goals as Expected Effects describing the direction of a hypothesized effect in order to more cleanly distinguish these two levels. We also added sub-levels to differentiate elicited measures (e.g., subjective confidence, probability, etc.) from derived measures (e.g., alignment between confidence and accuracy, error, etc.) After all substantive changes, we recoded any affected paths. Our taxonomy includes 76 total codes, with an average of 12.7 codes per each of the six levels.</p><p>The first and second author evaluated all studies, resolving inconsistencies between their codes and discuss ambiguities. Our final coded sample includes 372 paths (mean per publication: 4.3 paths).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">UNCERTAINTY VISUALIZATION EVALUATION TAXONOMY</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Overview</head><p>Our taxonomy proposes six levels of decisions that characterize an uncertainty visualization evaluation. We distinguish between aspects of an evaluation that describe its Research Values and Aims (L1, L2), and those that describe its Research Design (L3 -L6).</p><p>Applying our taxonomy to the 86 studies in our sample produced 372 instances of evaluation paths. We present each code, along with its definition, frequency, and examples below, and depict all coded paths in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. Our supplement, available at https://github.com/ jhullman/uncertaintyVisEval (10.5281/zenodo.1324465), provides interactive visualizations that associate paths with studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">L1, L2: Research Values and Aims</head><p>Research values and aims are comprised of Behavioral Targets (L1) describing the focal dimension of the uncertainty visualization(s)' impact and Expected Effects (L2) representing the directions of expected outcomes that are framed as either more or less desirable (e.g., more risk aversion, more confidence as ideal behavior).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">L1: Behavioral Targets</head><p>We assigned each evaluation path one of three broad categories of visualization effects that a study can attempt to isolate:</p><p>• Performance (241; 64.8%): how effectively a user can extract information, make inferences, or make decisions with a visualization (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">85]</ref>). • Interpretation &amp; Semantics (64; 17.2%): the ease with which a user associates uncertainty with an encoding (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref>). • Quality of User Experience (67; 1.8%): the user's valuation of the visualization, such as their preference or satisfaction (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>).</p><p>The first two categories map closely to those applied in prior surveys of visualization evaluation (i.e., Kinkledey et al's <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> "effect" and "communication", which can be traced to subsets of Isenberg et al.'s <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>'s codes for assessing visualization evaluation. We decided to create a separate category for "Quality of User Experience" as Expected Effects associated with these Behavioral Targets tended to differ from Expected Effects associated with Behavioral Targets of Performance and Interpretation &amp; Semantics in that the correctness and/or format of the user's internal representation was not of interest.</p><p>Our results make clear that most evaluation paths (241; 64.8%) in our sample framed the Behavioral Target (L1) as an assessment of Performance. Performance targets imply that visualizations are tools for supporting analytical tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">L2: Expected Effects</head><p>In addition to targeting a specific dimension of behavior, evaluation studies typically presuppose the direction of an effect of interest. We defined Expected Effects including:</p><p>• Accuracy (134; 36%): Difference from a ground truth response (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>). • Confidence/Accuracy Alignment (5; 1.3%): Correlation between confidence and accuracy (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>). • Impact on Decision-Making (3; 0.8%): Effects on decisions where no ground truth is implied (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>). • Decision Quality (14; 3.8%): Difference from a rational decision standard (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref>). • Memorability (3; 0.8%): How well a fact is remembered (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>). • Risk Avoidance (23; 6.2%): The degree to which a user's response attempts to avoid risk (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>). • Intuitiveness/Reading ease (31; 8.3%): How "naturally" a visualization supports correct interpretations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>). • Awareness of Judgment Process (8; 2.1%): The user's ability to recognize aspects of their judgment (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>). • Learnability (0): The user's ability to improve their performance over time • Confidence (24; 6.5%): The degree of belief in the validity or truth of a judgment, data set, visualization, etc. (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>). • Satisfaction (38; 10.2%): The user's aesthetic valuation of a visualization (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref>). • Interaction (4; 1.1%): How much interaction a visualization receives in time, number of clicks, etc. (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>).</p><p>• Efficiency (37; 9.9%): How well a visualization supports quick judgments (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>).</p><p>We coded evaluation paths that did not imply any expected direction for an effect on user responses as intending to:</p><p>• Understand internal model (48; 12.9%): Seeking to understand how a judgment is made (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">87]</ref>).</p><p>Our goal with L2 was to capture the assumptions that drive evaluators toward focusing on a certain type of response as a signal of whether an uncertainty visualization "works". As such, decisions at L4 Measures tend to be dependent on L2.</p><p>A total of 324 (87%) evaluation paths implied an Expected Effect (L2), either explicitly through a hypothesis or prediction, or implicitly in how the goal of uncertainty visualization was framed in contextualizing the task. Over one third of evaluation paths described tasks where ground truth could be used to establish what an accurate versus inaccurate response looked like. Among the 48 (13%) paths that did not imply an Expected Effect, those associated with Performance targets tended to represent attempts to understand users' mental models or strategies as a means of understanding why judgments were better or worse. When associated with an Interpretation &amp; Semantics target, these paths similarly tended to represent attempts to understand mental models or strategies, but where this understanding was framed as a primary goal, rather than being in service of supporting Performance or a better User Experience (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">87]</ref>). We did not observe any cases where a Behavioral Target of Quality of User Experience was assessed with a subgoal of trying to understand the user's internal model.</p><p>We coded paths that did not imply a desired direction for an effect as aiming to "Understand the user's internal model".</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">L3: Evaluation Goal</head><p>We observed several forms of comparisons that a study could use:</p><p>• Compare impacts of multiple uncertainty visualizations (255;</p><p>68.5%): Results of one or more tasks are used to rank two or more uncertainty visualizations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>).</p><p>• Determine the impact of presenting uncertainty (98; 26.3%):</p><p>At least one visualization that does not contain uncertainty information is evaluated (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>). • Validate effectiveness of an uncertainty vis (5; 1.3%): A user study is designed to confirm that a visualization improves some response(s). (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>). • Understand why/how a visualization works (54; 14.5%): Responses to a visualization(s) are analyzed to identify or confirm some judgment mechanism (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[87]</ref>). • Understand interactions with user characteristics <ref type="formula">(53;</ref>14.2%): The effect of properties of the user (expertise, location, etc.) on responses is analyzed (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>).</p><p>Notably, 170 (45.7%) of the 372 evaluation paths that we coded that compared multiple visualizations did not include any other evaluation goals. We are nonetheless encouraged by the fact that roughly a quarter of paths (98) involved a comparison to a no-uncertainty baseline condition, a technique that others have suggested should be more common in the uncertainty visualization evaluation literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">L4: Measures</head><p>Measures prescribe what aspects of users' behavior or beliefs are elicited to assess whether expected effects have been achieved.</p><p>• Decision measures (31; 8.3%) -Decision (31; 8.3%): A hypothetical choice action (e.g., saying when they would leave for the bus <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>). -Allocation (0%): An amount of currency wagered to endorse a choice (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>).</p><p>• Attribute-based measures (141; 37.9%) -Value of [nominal | ordinal | continuous] variable (67; 18%): Specifying a value along a provided scale (e.g., asking the user to estimate the forecasted temperature from a display <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>). -Count (15; 4%): Specifying a count (e.g., of features of a certain type). -Probability (29; 7.8%): A probability specified as a probability or frequency (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>) or as a Likert-style question asking for the relative probability of an event (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>). -Variance (4; 1.1%): A value or set of values describing how much an outcome can vary (i.e., a range, standard deviation, standard error, etc. as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>). -Rank by [data attribute | uncertainty attribute] (22;</p><p>5.9%): The top k features sorted by a numerical attribute.</p><p>• Self-report measures (161; 43.3%) -Spontaneous Impression (16; 4.3%): An unconstrained description of one's reaction to a visualization (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>). to use or recommend information or an artifact (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>). Often evaluators use directly elicited measures as input to transformations. For example, both Error and Bias are derived measures that can be calculated for a number of lower level measures given ground truth. We therefore distinguish between the measure that is directly elicited (L4a, above) and Derived Measures (L4b, below) which describe the possible transformations of the lower level measures. confidence, probability estimate, belief, etc. changes after using a visualization (e.g., evaluating how much people's judgments about climate change realities change after viewing a visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>).</p><p>• Decision Measures (14; 3.8%):</p><p>-Utility maximization (7; 1.9%): How closely a decision aligns with the optimal decision under utility theory. -Compliance with optimal strategy (7; 1.9%): How closely a user's responses follow an optimal strategy.</p><p>• Explanatory Measures (7; 1.9%):</p><p>-Shape of response function (3; 0.8%): The shape of a user's inferred internal judgment function (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[87]</ref>). ance in GSR signals (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[93]</ref>). -Eye fixations (2; 0.5%): Distance between sequential fixations, frequency between short distances, etc. (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>). -Time (29; 7.8%): The duration of a task completed by the user (a session, question response, etc.).</p><p>Our results indicate that the most common category of Measure (L4a) in our sample was Self-Report Measures, with multiple specific measures (Subjective Confidence, Self-reported Satisfaction, and Perceived Ability/Effort each occurring in more than 5% of evaluation paths). Attribute-based measures were also common, including Values of Nominal, Ordinal, and Continuous variables but also to some extent Probability and Rankings of entities by uncertainty or another quantitative variable. Decision Measures and Implicit measures were both notably less common.</p><p>More than half of all evaluation paths included Derived Measures (L4b).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.3">L5: Elicitation</head><p>Elicitation concerns how measurements are generated. For example, a study that compares how different uncertainty visualizations (L3 Compare impacts of multiple uncertainty visualizations) impact users' confidence in their decisions (L4 Subjective confidence) could ask users to rate their confidence on a scale from 50 (random) to 100 (certain) implemented as a continuous slider with numerically labeled endpoints (L5 Slider). Research outside of visualization suggests that measures related to subjective uncertainty are sensitive to the elicitation process <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72]</ref>. By distinguishing among formats for collecting users' responses, our goal is to increase the level of awareness of elicitation as a critical design choice in uncertainty visualization evaluation and visualization evaluation more broadly. We observed elicitation through:</p><p>• Physical apparatus (6; 1.6%): Interactions with physical objects (e.g., casts of the human body <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[85]</ref>). • Direct selection (10; 2.7%): Input recorded through interaction with a stimulus (e.g., user clicks on location on map <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>). • Graphical (15; 4%): The use of a visualization to gather responses, either by asking a user to construct a representation or by asking a user to adjust a representation (e.g., the position of a visualized outcome on a plot relative to error bars <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>). The majority of evaluation paths involve use standard survey inputs, with Multiple Choice and Likert-style inputs being notably more common than Text-entry or Sliders. Combining this information with the prevalence of error measures and self-report measures, these results suggest that many uncertainty visualization evaluations rely on either self-reported assessments of how well a visualization worked, or accuracy measures calculated on highly constrained sets of options (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> or less being typical of most multiple choice questions we observed).</p><p>The next most common form of elicitation was Implicit, which most commonly took the form of logging time spent with a visualization. Also worth noting, 44 (11.8%) paths did not mention how they elicited a specified measure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.4">L6: Analysis</head><p>The analysis paradigm describes how the elicited measurements are summarized and used to assess to what degree the desired effects have been achieved. We distinguished between the following approaches:</p><p>• Most paths used Summary Statistics. 77 (20.7%) paths used Summary Statistics without relying on inferential statistics (NHST or estimation) to draw final conclusions. Not surprisingly, Frequentist NHST analyses dominate the use of inferential statistics in the uncertainty visualization studies we coded. We observed only 24 paths that used estimation, half of which used Bayesian models to estimate bias and variance separately; and no examples of Bayesian NHST.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS</head><p>In contrast to code frequencies by level of the taxonomy, looking at cooccurring decisions in evaluation paths provides a more holistic view of how choices and assumptions at one level of the taxonomy may influence decisions at other levels. We characterize common paths, then present recommendations where the patterns that emerge suggest missed opportunities in light of research on uncertainty elicitation and comprehension in other fields.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">Interpretation &amp; Semantics Paths</head><p>While the majority of studies with Performance or User Experience research questions implied a priori Expected Effects, studies with Interpretation and Semantics research questions were less likely to imply a specific direction of Expected Effect. Even where an Expected Effect was posited to address an Interpretation and Semantics research question (e.g., suggesting that an encoding should be perceived as more intuitive for presenting uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64]</ref>), Interpretation and Semantics evaluation paths tended to assume a more exploratory approach to soliciting responses to a visualization. Such evaluations often elicited unconstrained spontaneous impressions of a visualization (16; 4.3%) or self-reported actions (17; 4.6%) using written inputs or oral approaches such as interviews and think-aloud protocols (21; 5.6%).</p><p>We observed an important subset of Interpretation and Semantics that used more constrained tasks to elicit internal representations of a probability distribution. Tak et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[87]</ref> characterized participants' internal representations of a probability distribution by repeatedly asking them to specify the amount of uncertainty at a given location on a 2D visualization. Similarly, Bisantz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> asked participants to describe how much linguistic expressions (e.g., "probable") captured a probability value by asking participants to specify the "membership" of a given probability for an uncertainty representation along a continuous scale from "Not at all" to "Absolutely." Hullman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> asked users to "draw" their prediction for a distribution using a continuous or discrete representation of probability.</p><p>Other Interpretation &amp; Semantics paths focused on eliciting evidence of a user's mental process to confirm whether people were employing specific heuristics or biases in interpreting a visualization. For instance, Correll and Gleicher <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> evaluated uncertainty visualizations of confidence intervals to see if participants were subject to "within-the-bar" bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>, where outcomes within the visual area of bar charts were perceived as more likely than those outside of the bar. Similarly, Correll et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> examine how different color maps for uncertainty can result in participants under-or over-weighting uncertainty information when making decisions. Neither study's sole focus was a comparison with a ground truth correct decision. Instead, responses were examined for systematic patterns of decision-making that would indicate a bias or heuristic that might be undesirable in real-world decision-making tasks. Sometimes self-reports were utilized for this purpose; for example, Padilla et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref> used debriefings to evaluate the use of heuristics, breaking down patterns of responses by heuristic strategies used to make judgments about uncertainty.</p><p>Less commonly, Interpretation &amp; Semantics paths examined how amount of uncertainty influenced bias or error <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref>, recognizing the findings of prospect theory in decision science <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Accuracy vs. Decision Quality</head><p>Multiple researchers have called for a greater focus on realistic decision making in uncertainty visualization evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">79]</ref>. The focus on accuracy and performance measures that we and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">79]</ref> have observed risks glossing over the difference between being able to identify information in a visualization and being able to use it effectively in a decision. Our analysis demonstrates the differences between these two approaches <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 3)</ref>.</p><p>Assessing Accuracy (L2) was roughly 10 times more common than assessing Decision Quality (L2) in our sample. Even when Decisions (L4) were elicited, by posing a hypothetical scenario in which the user should 'act', Increasing Accuracy was roughly twice as common compared to Increasing Decision Quality. Paths that did focus on Decisions often provided a more thorough motivation for incentives, from designing decision payoffs based on formative studies of how people valued certain outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> to the development of multiple specific hypotheses related to the impact of incentives on users' decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.3">Assessing Confidence</head><p>Approximately 20% (72) of paths we observed emphasized constructs associated with one's subjective sense of confidence, including Subjective Confidence (28), Perceived Risk/Reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>, and Perceived Effort/Ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>. Subjective Confidence and Perceived Effort/Ability were typically framed as eliciting a participant's subjective sense of the accuracy or effortfulness of their own judgment or of the external (visualized) information. Perceived Risk/Reliability asked the user to report how likely they thought they were to be affected by some event, representing an explicitly subjective version of probability. Conversely, when studies asked participants to estimate perceived uncertainty via probabilities, rankings, or other measures that error was derived from, these constructs were framed as inquiring about objective information. Subjective confidence was typically treated as a secondary form of effect, with priority given to the "objective" measures to determine, for instance, the best of multiple visualizations.</p><p>The lack of motivation for how these constructs do or should differ suggests that subjective uncertainty is not a well defined construct in visualization evaluation. Indeed, we see clear differences in assumptions about how to treat even the measures that are clearly framed as subjective. Some researchers address confidence and perceived risk as subjective feelings with no ground truth, aligning with theories that subjective confidence should not necessarily be expected to behave like statistical confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. For example, Blenkinsop et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> interpret directional shifts in confidence between visualization conditions, saying things like "participants had more confidence" or participants expressed "low confidence in the use of these displays". In making such assumptions, evaluators maintain transparency about what they are measuring but sacrifice normative conclusions.</p><p>In contrast, some researchers take a normative approach by comparing confidence to a ground truth, assuming that these constructs carry a similar meaning across individuals, and that that meaning is more or less directly comparable to an "objective" statistical account. Such approaches assume that confidence provided for a judgment should be a signal of a participant's probability of being correct for that judgment, or of some objective measure of probability. For example, Ibrekk and Morgan <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> analyzed intrasubject correlations, looking for an association between how sure a participant was about their response being correct and the correctness (i.e., error) of the response. Correll and Gleicher <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, on the other hand, evaluated how confidence decayed as a potential outcome got further from the mean, as well as how confidence correlated with effect size and p-value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Recommendations for Evaluators</head><p>Our analysis surfaced biases, e.g., toward Performance and Accuracy, confirmatory goals and analysis, as well as opportunities for expanding the default "toolbox" such as moving beyond standard constrained HTML input elicitation through Multiple choice and Likert-style responses. Drawing on our observations and research on uncertainty comprehension and elicitation from outside of visualization, we propose recommendations toward more transparent, and internally and externally valid evaluations of uncertainty visualizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1">R1: Consider Explaining As An End Goal</head><p>As described above, studies that posed Behavioral Targets of Interpretation &amp; Semantics were the most likely to work toward a goal of understanding how or why users acted in certain ways when using an uncertainty visualization. A simple way to do so is to elicit participant's descriptions of how they made a judgment, or what information they found helpful, to provide greater context for differences that might be observed. More sophisticated strategies for explaining uncertainty visualization including analyzing results for evidence of heuristic use <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70]</ref> or prospect theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref>. We propose that uncertainty visualization evaluators in particular have a responsibility to attempt to elicit and explain why observed differences between conditions might exist due to the complexity of uncertainty comprehension and associated heuristics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2">R2: Use Decision Frameworks for Realism &amp; Control</head><p>An accuracy approach can establish, at base, how well a user can extract a probability or other information necessary to make an informed decision-but not that the user would know how to use that probability to make an informed decision. If estimation error were the only contributing factor in differences in decision quality between representations, designers should simply choose the most perceptually effective uncertainty encoding (i.e., that which best achieves L2's goal of Increasing Accuracy) in all cases. However, different framings can affect influence whether users apply the information: e.g., frequency framings can improve Bayesian reasoning about probability <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, perhaps because frequency framings simplify certain calculations, or perhaps because people's added familiarity with frequencies from daily occurrences makes them feel more confident with the information.</p><p>Eliciting decisions, in the form of hypothetical actions like where to locate an airport or park <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> or which location the user would suggest a person with certain goals buy <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> allows the evaluator to examine whether users understand uncertainty in light of a specific decision context. Other questions that can be answered via decision tasks include whether a subject feels confident enough to use the information given the potential rewards or consequences of the decision. In a realworld decision context, participants have consequences for choosing incorrectly, and may even have conflicting decision criteria or tradeoffs to make (e.g., balancing the chance of an incorrect snow forecast against the cost of failing to ice the road <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>).</p><p>Economic frameworks, such as Utility Maximization (L4 Derived) offer one approach to assessing decision quality. Joslyn and LeClerc <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>, for example, give participants a budget and have them decide whether to salt the road given weather forecasts with different displays, with costs for failing to salt if it does snow. The remaining budget after many trials becomes a measure of decision quality. Similarly, Fernandes et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> follow up a prior study <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> that assessed the Accuracy (L2) of probability extraction from probabilistic predictions of bus arrival times with an incentivized experiment where participants decide when to catch simulated buses. Participants are paid according to a utility function, and the ratio of their expected payment under the decisions they made to the payment under an optimal strategy is used to assess Decision Quality (L4 Derived).</p><p>These approaches offer a controlled means of decision assessment that attempts to include realistic tradeoffs. Given multiple trials, they can be used to compare how well people can learn to use uncertainty displays as they make more decisions and receive feedback. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> We observed that in contrast to accuracy studies, researchers who applied such approaches also tended to include controlled comparisons between no uncertainty and a visual representation, which can help answer in what situations uncertainty helps or not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.3">R3: Account for the Ambiguity of Confidence</head><p>All of these approaches, when used as described above, do not account for several known properties of confidence reporting. The "hard-easy effect" is a counter-intuitive pattern of behavior in which people report overconfidence when presented with a difficult task and underconfidence when presented with an easy task <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66]</ref>. This is partially explained by people's tendency to report low confidence for incorrect judgments, especially when made in the face of an easy task <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[81]</ref>. Hence, an analysis like the one used by Ibrekk and Morgan, which uncovered no clear differences between visualizations based on confidence reporting, may have been confounded by the difference between confidence reported for a judgment that is likely to be wrong versus one that is likely to be right. Only two studies in our sample of 86 that explicitly accounted for the difference in confidence reports for a wrong versus a right answer, by weighting confidence values for a correct judgment significantly more than those for an incorrect judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>.</p><p>A second issue that was not explicitly addressed in any of the confidence evaluation paths we observed is that confidence reports are known to be subject to considerable noise. For example, experience, effort, and information availability can lead to increased confidence without comparable increases in accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75]</ref>, confidence can be inconsistent even for the same task, and participants may report confidence using idiosyncratic methods like rounding values. This can mean that subjective confidence is not a direct linear function of statistical confidence, and that trial order and other contextual factors should be accounted for. We conclude that evaluators should clearly state their motivation for why they consider a certain confidence outcome (e.g., higher confidence) to be superior and account for effects of binary accuracy and experience (e.g., trial number) on results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.4">R4: Validate Elicited Responses</head><p>Research outside of visualization describes how subjective accounts of uncertainty can be sensitive to the elicitation method as well as other properties of a task context or user <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>. We observed several ways that evaluators in our sample sought to increase the validity of the responses they gathered. We highlight a few of these techniques to encourage further use of validations for uncertainty visualization.</p><p>Recognize the effects of priors: A few studies allowed for the fact that users may have different prior beliefs or perceptions of an event for which uncertainty is shown by using pre-and post-visualization questions. Herring et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> assessed the change in participants' beliefs about climate change after seeing a visualization. Ibrekk and Morgan <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> examined whether explaining a visualization helped users better understand it relative to their base knowledge.</p><p>Calibrate the user: In real life, uncertainty is often experienced as the percentage of the time when an event occurs versus does not (e.g., catching versus missing one's daily bus when leaving the house at 8am). By definition, under uncertainty it is possible to make the "right" decision (e.g., getting to the bus stop at the optimal time to minimize average wait), but still experience the "wrong" outcome (e.g., missing the bus). Studies that measured decision quality against utility theory were most likely to provide feedback on the uncertain outcomes they asked participants about <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref>, though some studies that used simpler error measures also incorporated feedback for realism and calibration <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Use graphical elicitation to reduce noise: Graphical elicitation of subjective uncertainty has been shown to reduce error in subjective probability reporting <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Even when the elicited measure is not subjective probability, graphical elicitation increases the likelihood that participants will process the visualization sufficiently to provide their best guess. For example, in Belia et al.'s study of error bar interpretation (a task that is known to be error prone) participants were asked to adjust the position visualized mean with an error bar so that it was just statistically significantly different from another mean <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Allow for "no answer" as a valid response: A few evaluation paths specifically allowed for the fact that a participant faced with uncertain options might find the information too ambiguous to feel confident enough to point to a difference <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73]</ref>. For example, Padilla et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref> added an additional study in their work to allow for a judgment that multiple locations along a possible hurricane path were approximately equal inexpected damage. This approach accounts for the case where a user is not confident enough to point to a difference.</p><p>Account for numeracy and other subject-specific characteristics: In addition to studies that explicitly evaluated how user characteristics impacted use of a visualization (L3 -Understand interactions with user characteristics), multiple studies in our sample controlled for ability covariates that could influence performance. For example, evaluators measured numeracy (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>), subjective numeracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>, and spatial ability (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>) using established scales. Some evaluators also employed standard elicitation instruments. This tended to occur in studies of Bayesian reasoning, where problems are well defined <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>, but we also observed evaluators using standard scales for aspects of user experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>, such as the User Experience Questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</p><p>Compare to textual uncertainty: Another way in which evaluators sought to increase the validity of their results was by comparing uncertainty visualizations to text representations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>) for added insight about why visualizations may or may not have helped. Including text conditions also acknowledged the potential for visualizations-and in particular uncertainty visualizations-to present more information than needed relative to text <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">DISCUSSION: SUBJECTIVE UNCERTAINTY AS CONSTRUCT</head><p>Our results suggest a mismatch between how uncertainty comprehension is viewed in visualization evaluation versus how it is viewed in fields that deal more directly with cognition (e.g., judgment and decision making). Our results suggest that visualization evaluators show either an accuracy-efficiency bias by assuming that it is sufficient to measure the effectiveness of a visualization by comparing how accurately or efficiently people can make judgments from multiple uncertainty visualizations using standard survey style prompts, or they rely on explicit value judgments, where users are asked directly whether uncertainty visualization helped them to make a judgment. Further, we find a tendency toward confirmation over explanation, where the majority of evaluation studies do not try to explain the effects that they find. We also find that simpler alternatives (No uncertainty or text representations) are considered in a minority of evaluations.</p><p>As others have noted, the accuracy-efficiency bias introduces a risk that the effects identified in a study will not persist in actual decision tasks, where decision makers are incentivized by real world consequences. We note the importance of decision feedback for calibrating decisions in experimental scenarios, and we describe how decision paradigms informed by economic theory can help maintain both the control and realism that others have argued is difficult to achieve in this context <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">79]</ref>.</p><p>Further, evidence from other discplines suggests that people are not very good at making accurate judgments about their own ability to make judgments under uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>. Again, attempts to understand strategies could prove useful for surfacing when a person's sense of confidence in themselves or a visualization is not aligned with the evaluator's expectations for use. We also suggest that how well a person can assess their performance should be explicitly modeled where possible, such as in using confidence reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[81]</ref>.</p><p>Possible threats to validity arise when evaluators seek to confirm hypotheses without also seeking to understand and explain why differences exist between uncertainty visualizations. One possible reason for differences in user performance is that people use heuristics to simplify judgments from uncertainty (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">92]</ref>). Finally, omitting simpler presentations makes it less likely that evaluators will realize when uncertainty information is unnecessary for the task, or being disregarded by the user. The evaluation paths we observed that attempt to uncover strategies used to respond to a task therefore provide an important lesson for future evaluation work.</p><p>The studies in our sample rarely, if ever, acknowledged differences among alternative conceptions of uncertainty such as risk, ambiguity, and error. Research outside of visualization provides empirical evidence for different conceptions of uncertainty held by decision makers <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65]</ref>) and may be informative for visualization researchers by prompting deeper consideration of what subjective uncertainty means in the context of visualization use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION</head><p>We present a taxonomy of methods for evaluating uncertainty visualizations and describe the results of a qualitative analysis applying our framework to 86 publications which represent the state of uncertainty visualization evaluation. Our results indicate that current evaluation practices focus primarily on a small set of Performance and User Experience concerns in order to compare uncertainty visualization designs. While these studies about Performance and User Experience tend to seek "confirmatory" evidence for the superiority of some visualization technique, a much smaller set of studies addressing issues of Interpretation tend to be more "explanatory". We characterize overall trends in evaluation paths (i.e., the co-occurrence of codes in our taxonomy) which indicate distinctions between methods for measuring Accuracy and Decision, as well as different methods for eliciting and assessing Subjective Confidence. Drawing on related research in judgment and decision making, we recommend specific steps that researchers should take when designing uncertainty visualization evaluations in order to strive for valid and transparent findings.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>A depiction of our evaluation taxonomy (top), which distinguishes evaluation decisions made at six different levels; and an example evaluation path (bottom) from the set of 372 paths that we coded across a sample of 86 publications.</figDesc></figure>
