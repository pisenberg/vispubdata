In this paper, we seek to facilitate enhanced comprehension of such documents through a contextual visualization technique that couples text content with data tables contained in the document. We parse the text content and data tables, cross-link the components using a keyword-based matching algorithm, and generate on-demand visualizations based on the reader&apos;s current focus within a document. We evaluate this technique in a user study comparing our approach to a traditional reading experience. Results from our study show that (1) participants comprehend the content better with tighter coupling of text and data, (2) the contextual visualizations enable participants to develop better summaries that capture the main data-rich insights within the document, and (3) overall, our method enables participants to develop a more detailed understanding of the document content.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Electronic documents are one of the most pervasive digital media in use today. Many of them are data-rich in that they are essentially complex datasets in themselves, containing not just text but also diverse forms of information such as tables, photographs, and illustrations (e.g., reports on hurricane damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[45]</ref> and cancer statistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">50]</ref>). However, most traditional document formats-even data-rich onesare still designed for print, which means that they are essentially static in nature and are not optimized for electronic reading. Examples of print formats include not only Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF), but also word processors such as Microsoft Word and Google Docs, as well as desktop publishing tools such as Adobe InDesign <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Even online formats, HTML in particular, still follow many of the conventions of print media when used as a data-rich document format. Current displays for data-rich documents not only often fail to provide a satisfactory reading experience, they also do not take full advantage of the dynamic nature of digital devices. Print formats often even constrain the layout, flow, and typography to a static and page-driven design. While modern e-book readers typically allow for changing font and font size as well as support hyperlinks and allow for reflowing paragraphs, they still lock the reader into a static and mostly linear reading sequence. In practice, reading a data-rich document on a digital device requires flipping back and forth to track linked content, such as associated figures and tables. This activity is often more cumbersome to perform on a digital device than using a physical document.</p><p>To improve the electronic document reading experience, we need to go beyond the classic notion that a document is a linear sequence of multimedia content with its layout and visual design fixed into a single presentation flow. Instead, a document can be viewed as a collection of multimedia content-essentially a heterogeneous dataset-to be dy-namically filtered, rearranged, and presented in any order depending on the readers' goals as well as the capacity of the display itself. Rendering such heterogeneous data on screen amounts to visualization.</p><p>Based on this idea, we present Elastic Documents, an adaptive approach for enhanced document reading. Text constitutes the main form of information in most data-rich documents, with data tables commonly used in reports and papers from corporations, government agencies, and non-profit organizations. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on two types of content-text and tables-within data-rich documents and investigate how to tightly couple them in an elastic document <ref type="figure">(Figure 1)</ref>. Our approach establishes this tight coupling by parsing the document text, structure, and embedded data tables, and using the explicit or implicit relations from words in the text to the data in the tables to dynamically generate contextual visualizations based on the user's focus and interest. By doing so, the reader can interpret the visualizations to understand the context from the data tables for text in focus, and go beyond the traditional linear structure of the document.</p><p>To understand the effectiveness of this approach, we evaluated a prototype implementation of Elastic Documents in a laboratory study with 14 participants in comparison to a conventional document viewer. On each interface, the participant summarized data-rich documents containing text and tables and then answered specific questions that connect the text and tables. We found that the participants created summaries based on broader data from the document when using Elastic Documents compared to the baseline. They also provided precise answers when the visualizations were present. Furthermore, we found differences in the reading patterns compared to the conventional document reader, with participants showing more focused reading for Elastic Documents that closely followed the narrative of the document by perceiving the visualizations rather than just consolidating text and tables. Overall, we contribute the following through this paper:</p><p>1. An approach for data-rich document viewing by connecting the text and data tables through contextual visualizations, using a three-step pipeline involving table content extraction and visualization based on user interaction. 2. A proof-of-concept implementation of the proposed approach. 3. Results from a validation of the proposed approach showcasing better performance and usage patterns compared to a baseline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Here we summarize three related research themes that inform our Elastic Documents approach for data-rich documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Adaptive Document Viewing</head><p>Multiple research efforts augment or transform static documents for specific functions and activities. Grossman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> demonstrate how to replace static images with animated figures in PDFs to benefit text comprehension. Document Cards <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[54]</ref> summarizes research papers by choosing important figures and presenting the gist of the document in a deck of cards for quick consumption of document content. Jacobs et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref> investigate automatic formatting and layout of document content to adapt different display sizes. Fluid documents <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> dynamically update the visual salience of primary content (e.g., body of text) in a document and supporting materials (e.g., annotations) depending on user focus. TextTearing <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[65]</ref> introduces a technique that expands inter-line white space in a document for digital ink annotation. Finally, LiquidText <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[56]</ref> provides a multi-touch environment with a fluid document representation for active reading tasks such as highlighting and annotating. While these efforts add flexibility to static digital documents, they focus primarily on adapting the layout and not on connecting multiple entities in the content, such as text and tables. Within accessibility research, document adaptation is important for helping readers with reading disabilities or visual impairment. For instance, techniques have been introduced to help visually impaired users by automatically transforming textual documents into responsive layouts on a small screen that can be selected to be read-out-loud by a speech synthesizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">53]</ref>. Screen magnifiers <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> have also been effective to adapt documents to the needs of people with vision impairment. While the Elastic Documents approach is not designed for this domain, these research efforts showcase the current advances and methods for parsing and adapting documents to the user.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Generating Visualizations from Text and Tables</head><p>Visualizations have long been used for distant reading of documents <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref> by transforming the text content into an abstract view to present global features. Techniques such as tag clouds <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[61]</ref>, social relationship graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>, and Phrase Nets <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[59]</ref> support distant reading. For close reading <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, it is important to retain the text structure and content. Hence visual aids in close reading rely on augmentation through colors, fonts, and visual marks <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Jänicke et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> surveyed such distant and close reading techniques for digital humanities.</p><p>Data visualizations have also been used to enhance and complement news articles. Contextifier <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref> automates the generation of annotated visualizations of stock prices for companies mentioned in an article. NewsViews <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> extends this approach to geovisualization and works with a broader set of news articles and data sources obtained through crawling. PersaLog <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> contributes a domain-specific language for personalizing visualizations in news articles given a reader profile. However, these approaches all assume that datasets are separate from the text content, and the data schema is relatively simple.</p><p>In our case, the relevant data tables are included in the documents, but the structures of the tables are more complex. We thus used approaches introduced by Chen and Cafarella <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17]</ref> to parse and extract data from data-frame tables <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>. Previous approaches of automatic visualization generation often rely on column types and names to decide encoding choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>. While these efforts enable us to work with existing data spreadsheets and tables, the question of how to extract tables from documents (in, say, PDF format) still needs to be answered for Elastic Documents. PDF-TREX <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[43]</ref>, introduced by Oro and Ruffolo, is a heuristic approach for parsing PDF documents to recognize tables. Extraction of complex hierarchical tables from PDF documents has also been achieved through such heuristic approaches (cf. pdf2table <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[64]</ref>). Now, commercial tools such as Adobe Acrobat <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> support parsing and extraction of content from PDF documents.</p><p>Visualizations can enhance text and table reading. <ref type="table">Table Lens [</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">46]</ref> represents an early approach to improve table reading through in-situ visualizations in an interactive layout. Bertin's matrices <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">44]</ref> exemplify tabular visualizations by visually encoding cell values within tables and supporting grouping operations. Word-scale visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24]</ref> enhance document reading with graphical encodings that span the size of a word embedded in the text content. However, there are open questions in the design of word-scale visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> and in generating them for data-rich documents. To connect visualizations to the text being read, Kong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref> utilized crowdsourcing to extract relations and highlighted them in a document viewer.</p><p>In contrast to Chen and Cafarella <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, we go beyond table headers and use cell values for visualization and highlighting. Also, our approach focuses on separating the visualizations and using them to connect the text and tables based on the user's focus, and hence, we have not yet considered the word-scale approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Effects of Visual Aids in Document Reading</head><p>Many studies evaluate and explain the role of visual aids in text comprehension. For instance, illustrations are found to help mentally represent procedures described in text <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. Illustrations also help with the construction of a mental model that facilitates inferences in text comprehension <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. Zellweger et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[66]</ref> evaluated fluid documents <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> through an eye-tracking based study and found no differences in eye movement patterns when glosses, previews of hypertext content, are introduced. Duke and Pearson recommend that effective practices to improve reading comprehension include providing visual representations of text <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. Recently, an evaluation of word-scale visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> has not confirmed any effect of these representations in question answering tasks, but participants may rely on them instead of textual sentences in case of ambiguity. While there is a developed understanding of the role of visualization in problem solving <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> and exploratory analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[57]</ref>, there still is a need to evaluate the affordances of visualization on comprehension and recall in document reading.  <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>: Example data-rich documents from public sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr">58]</ref>. Both documents were released in the past three years and include long tables spanning many pages along with a data-rich textual narrative.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS: DATA-RICH DOCUMENTS</head><p>Here we review the concept of data-rich documents as well as the design requirements we collected for close reading of such documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Data Model</head><p>A data-rich document is a form of document that conveys information using text as well as rich media such as tables, illustrations, and images. While text forms the primary content describing the main message of the story, it is augmented with other content types to support the narration with factual information <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>). Data-rich documents come from a variety of sources. For science, they form the means to communicate, record, and replicate scientific progress in academic journals and conferences by presenting results in text augmented by data tables, images, and illustrations of results, procedures, and outcomes. For open data, data-rich reports are issued by private and public agencies to communicate findings, establish accountability, and detail procedures. For instance, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> releases situation reports following hurricanes and tropical storms in the United States containing information from scientific sources about the timeline, the collected statistical measures, casualty and damage information, and accuracy of the forecasting models. In business, financial reports, replete with numerous data tables, are released by companies to track their profit and expenses.</p><p>While there exist many data-rich documents online, 2 we will focus on two documents-a report on Hurricane Alex from NHC <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref> and a quarterly report from Apple <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>-as the running examples to describe our Elastic Documents approach. Both documents are canonical datarich documents in that they incorporate data tables and illustrations to complement the textual content with factual data. However, reading these documents on a traditional document viewer is complicated because the tables and figures are large and sometimes span several pages, and references between the text and other content may require <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> NHC reports: https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/tcr/ 2 Sample data-rich documents: http://ter.ps/datadocs scrolling back and forth in the document. Our goal with Elastic Documents is to simplify the reading experience of data-rich documents by adapting the document content viewed to the user.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Tasks and Design Requirements</head><p>A major challenge with data-rich documents is reading the tables that tend to be long, complex, and often hard to connect to the text (shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). Therefore, we focus on the data tables as they are most amenable to automatically parse and connect to the textual content.</p><p>There are a wide range of reading tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33]</ref> including distant reading, browsing, searching, active reading, and close reading. We focus on close reading <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and quick comprehension where users read and may even reread the document to extract data in a given amount of time to understand the main insights. This is applicable to datarich documents as they are often used by journalists as an information source or by the public as a general reference. To answer these challenges, we considered the following requirements: R1 Augment documents with visual aids. Most data-rich documents present structured data in tables to augment textual content. Referring to raw data tables while reading the textual narrative is challenging in terms of understanding the data and its connection to the text. Therefore, visualizations can be used to ease comprehension of data in data-rich documents, owing to their benefits in data sensemaking <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">51]</ref> and close reading <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>. R2 Simplify complex and long table structures. Tables in datarich documents are often complex since they record the factual data related to the topics in the text. They do not always follow a relational table format, and hierarchy within columns and rows in the tables <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16]</ref> is common ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>). Moreover, they may contain sparse structures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3</ref>(c)). From a user's perspective, these complexities should be hidden to provide effective representations of the tables. R3 Connect content spread across text and tables. Data-rich documents also spread the text and data tables across pages <ref type="figure">(Figure 2)</ref>. To go beyond a linear layout that requires scrolling backand-forth, Elastic Documents should bridge the content across text and tables (cf. adaptive document layouts for fitting text and graphics to a display <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>). For this purpose, the data from the tables should be presented in context to the user while reading the text to enhance document reading. R4 Adapt to user's interest. Data-rich documents cover multiple data attributes relevant to the purpose of the document. In doing so, parts of the document have specific footprint within the data tables. For instance, the report on Hurricane Alex <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref> (Figure 2(b)) begins with outlining the timeline of the hurricane followed by description of collected statistics, causalities, and forecasts. Therefore it is important to help the reader see relevant content and data attributes from the data tables when reading particular sections of text (e.g., timeline of Hurricane Alex). Understanding user's focus and interest while reading the document can help in augmenting the content with relevant visual aids.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">CONTEXTUAL VISUALIZATION OF DATA TABLES IN ELASTIC DOCUMENTS</head><p>In this paper, we focus on connecting the text and table content by generating visualizations that can help the user better comprehend the text and the underlying data while reading the document. These visual aids should be easy to interpret so as to not deviate the reader from the primary task of comprehending the text within the documents. To meet the above design requirements, we describe our approach through a three-stage document processing pipeline. We also discuss the design rationale in building an interactive interface for Elastic Documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Document Processing</head><p>The data-rich document processing pipeline consists of three stages:</p><p>(1) parsing document tables to extract data attributes from the table headers (based on Chen and Cafarella <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>), (2) generating visualizations, and (3) extracting and matching phrases from the text, as well as the tables, to make connections between them. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Relationships within row and column header cells in the tables along with the method for identifying them. Note that these are directly based on the four relations from Chen and Cafarella <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, but split further into six for clarity. Examples of these relations are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Parsing Table Content</head><p>Data-rich documents often contain multiple tables with relevant data attributes that support the textual content. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>, these tables are structured in many ways: ranging from flat relational table formats (rows and columns) to hierarchical row and column segments (e.g., rows within rows). For instance, Apple's quarterly report contains many tables tracking the income, assets, liabilities, etc., for the current and previous quarter along with some cells capturing total values (e.g., total income) for remaining cells in the table. This forms a data table containing hierarchies in row and column headers. Similarly, hierarchies exist in the tables within the reports from NHC and UNICEF ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>). These rich information structures in the tables are first parsed to identify entities and values within the document tables. Parsing of non-relational table structures has been an active research effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16]</ref>. Tools exist for transforming the data tables into long and wide formats <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34]</ref>. Our method requires segmentation of table content to understand the relationships within the row and column headers that define a hierarchy; therefore, we rely on the above research efforts. We characterize six such relationships within the table content based on the list from Chen and Cafarella <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>  <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>.</p><p>These relationships are identified while parsing the document tables to extract hierarchical attributes (parent-child structures) within the headers. Flat relational tables are a special case where the hierarchy contains a single level of attributes. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows the input, the workings, and the output of the parsing method applied to a table from Apple's Quarterly report. This report contains (1) stylistic similarities for cells within the same level of the hierarchy, (2) layout design for parent-child relations, and (3) overview/detail design with "total" and individual rows. The algorithm works by iterating over pairs of adjacent cells to tag them with possibilities and then iterating over the entire table to add cells to a hierarchical structure. The output contains hierarchical data structures for both rows and columns. This understanding of the table structure drives the generation of visual aids to support Elastic Documents, detailed in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Generating Visualizations</head><p>Parsing of the data tables extracts structured data and relationships within the table, which can be used to adapt the document content. Following requirement R1, our primary design choice is to utilize visual aids to understand the data tables while reading the document. Visualizations can be generated from the data tables by traversing the parsed hierarchies within the table headers to find combinations of rows and columns. However, the number of combinations can be large based on the density of the table-for sparse tables, certain combinations may not contain any data in the table (e.g., <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>(c)). Furthermore, since our goal is to use the visual aids to augment the document text, the representations should be easily interpretable without significant deviation from the reading task and contain sufficient labels to read the actual data values along with the trends. For instance, hierar- chical representations such as Treemaps <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[48]</ref> or Sunburst <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[52]</ref> would not be ideal as they are hard to interpret while document reading. For this purpose, we focus on generating visual aids by traversing the hierarchies in the table headers to find combinations of rows and columns that are meaningful and quick to understand (R2). We rely on combinations that generate familiar and simple representations such as line charts and bar charts. We call them, unit combinations. A unit combination is defined as a combination of multiple rows with a single column or multiple columns with a single row (essentially, a list of values). These combinations are meaningful as they can share the same unit and they can be visualized by mapping to a scale. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows example unit combinations for the hierarchies in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>.</p><p>Unit combinations are represented as a line chart or a bar chart depending on the data content. The values in the table cells for the unit combinations as well as the headers are used to develop the data scales for visual mapping. The row/column headers are checked for timeseries attributes by identifying time-related strings-months, years, hours, etc. By doing so, combinations with time-series attributes are represented as line charts, while the rest are presented using horizontal bar charts. Both charts are augmented with labels and axes to show the values along with the visual mapping. Note that the choice of the two chart types is meant to be a starting point to prototype the Elastic Documents approach. Alternate representations, more suitable to the content, are feasible depending on the document. For instance, unit combinations can be long if the table has a flat structure, in which case packed list representations can save space <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">63]</ref> or sampling techniques can be used to show details on demand. The unit combinations are generated automatically by gathering children of each node in the hierarchy and iterating through them as shown in Algorithms 1 and 2. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3">Linking Text and Visualizations</head><p>Simple visualizations-line and bar charts-are generated by extracting unit combinations of rows and columns ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). However, the number of such combinations and thus, visualizations will quickly increase with more tables in the documents. For instance, even for the small segment of a table in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, nine charts can be generated.</p><p>Going through all many such charts is infeasible when the focus is on reading the document. Therefore, the visualizations need to be adapted to the user's interest within the document (R4). This also ensures that the visualizations enhance the data-rich documents by bridging the text and the tables (R3). In our approach, we match extracted words from the text with the attributes and values in a visualization and its parent information from the tables to develop a relevance score.</p><p>Word extraction: For a given text, the attribute names and values (typically, a few words and numbers) from the tables should be matched to the context extracted from the document text to find relevant ones to be visualized and highlighted to the reader. We utilize textual preprocessing techniques such as stop word removal, stemming, and lemmatization to extract a set of words that convey the text context. For instance, consider this sentence, "Globally, there were an estimated 287000 maternal deaths in 2010, yielding a MMR of 210 maternal deaths per 1000000 live births among the 181 countries that were covered in this study." This sentence is picked by the reader in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Our extraction algorithm identifies the terms: "globally", "maternal", "deaths", "2010", "287000", "yield", "210", "100000", "live", "births', "181","countri", "cover","study." Such base forms of words are matched to the row and column headers and cell values. Scoring: The set of words from text is matched with the data behind the visualizations including the attribute names, their parents in the hierarchy, and their values. Individual matches are weighted and summed to compute a relevance score. We identified the weights by testing the approach ourselves and in the pilot testing before the evaluation. We used a binary weighing scheme: matches where the words from the text contain both the attribute name and corresponding value for a data item in a visualization weighted as w i = 1, while partial matches between word in text and attribute name or a parent attribute in a table weighted less (w i = 0.1; for the documents in the user study). These matches are exemplified in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>(c) with the first chart in the chart panel showcasing a complete match-both value "210" and year "2010" matching words from the selected text-and partial matches based only on the year appearing down the list. We adapt the visual aids to user's focus in the text by sorting the visualizations based on these relevance scores. Finally, these matches are also highlighted in the data tables to help the reader see the context in the data tables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Interface and Interaction Design</head><p>The document processing methods promise generation of contextual visualizations that bridge the text being read and the data tables present in the data-rich document. As a proof-of-concept, we developed a simple interface for the Elastic Documents approach as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> building on aforementioned design rationale. The interface separates the content types from the document and places them in three viewsa text view, a chart panel for generated visualizations, and a table view that can be minimized. The text view occupies the majority of the screen space to support reading the document content, while the table and chart panels augment the text by presenting the structured data. The visualizations shown on the chart panel are based on the user selection within the text and the filters or search items set by the user on the top right of the interface. We define two interaction mechanisms within the interface to connect the document content. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 6</ref>). 1. Specify current focus in text implicitly based on scrolling actions or explicitly by highlighting segments of the text. 2. Specify current focus in data attributes to convey interest in specific attributes within the document tables. Through the former, the user's focus in the text is processed to connect to the data within tables. Relevant visualizations are then shown on the top of the chart panel, along with highlights within the visualizations and the tables (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 6</ref>). Through the latter, user's interest in certain data attributes is identified as filters. Filtering on a dimension or a group of dimensions sorts corresponding visualizations to be on the top. Thus, the document is adapted to the user's interest (R4).</p><p>Design alternatives. The interface is split into three views to show text, tables, and the contextual visualizations separately. Alternative designs exist including, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> showing the visualizations and data on demand through tooltips, (2) placing the charts in-situ within the tables, similar to <ref type="table">Table Lens</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[46]</ref>, or (3) exploring a word-scale approach with charts embedded in the text. While these designs are also interesting, our current interface presents all three content types to the reader and makes the connections between text and tables more explicit, at the cost of extra screen space spent on the chart panel. The alternate designs can fit better in specific scenarios-e.g, in the presence of a limited display space. In terms of interaction design, the interactions described above are focused on presenting relevant data while reading the document text. Apart from them, our prototype also supports pinning a chart to always show it on top of the chart panel and saving user's focus and filters to retrieve them later. Beyond the ones in Elastic Documents, standardized interactions are needed to fully support close reading such as for note taking and annotation of the documents. <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>: The conventional document viewer interface used in the study. This interface retains the original layout of the document with text and tables at fixed positions and without visualizations. Only "search and find" interaction is available along with the ability to highlight.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Implementation</head><p>Our implementation of Elastic Documents is a proof-of-concept that connects the text and data tables with contextual visualizations. Our tool currently works with the example data-rich documents listed in this paper and therefore, it was used for our user study. It is built with HTML/CSS/JS technologies and D3 framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> for visualization. It uses Python as a back-end to extract hierarchies from tables and find combinations and serves them using a Flask server. The text processing is performed using Python's NLTK library <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">USER STUDY</head><p>Elastic Documents has the potential to present the data context through simple charts when reading the text. Such an approach promises to help the reader comprehend the document by connecting multiple content types. To understand the effectiveness of this overall approach, we chose to compare against a baseline--a conventional PDF viewerfor standard reading tasks to maintain the ecological validity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Interface Conditions</head><p>The study comprised of two conditions: Elastic Documents and Conventional Viewer interfaces. The Elastic Documents interface <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figures 1, 6</ref>) allows participants to: (1) view visual representations of the tables within documents, (2) interact with the text by selecting sentences by click or any text content by dragging the mouse, to see relevant visualizations from tables, (3) filter visualizations based on the table attributes using a dedicated drop-down menu, and (4) save selections and pin visualizations for future reference. On the other hand, the conventional viewer <ref type="figure">(Figure 7)</ref> shows the text and tables in a flat layout, with tables presented in their original fixed locations. It allows the user to search for keywords using web browser's search option and highlight parts of the document, similar to a typical document viewer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Datasets</head><p>Targeting a within-subject design, we chose two different documents for the two interface conditions to eliminate learning effects. We picked two data-rich documents from public sources on child mortality (CMR) [58] and maternal mortality (MMR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[62]</ref>. These documents have similar topics and comparable levels of complexity. Both data-rich documents showcase trends in mortality rates in developing and developed countries in the world and outline goals for the future. As such, they capture the mortality rates and deaths for regions of the world over time within the tables. For the scope of this study, we focused on parts of these documents that outline the levels and trends in mortality data (8-9 paragraphs) along with two tables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Participants</head><p>We recruited 14 participants (age 22-45; 7 female; 7 male). Participation was voluntary and participants received $10 for their work. Participants were visualization literate with experience in charting with tools such as Excel and Tableau; 4 of them used visualizations for data analysis (for their course or general work). All but one participant (P14) frequently work with documents-reading research papers and articles, or writing reports. Participants worked with both interfaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Tasks</head><p>As described earlier, data-rich documents can act as records of factual data, which makes them an information source for journalists and policymakers. Therefore, we identified two primary tasks:</p><p>• Summarization: Participants worked on one summarization task for each condition. They are asked to summarize the document in 6 sentences. They were instructed to capture the important points and data discussed in the document. Participants were allowed to use any of the aforementioned interactions with the interfaces for this purpose. • Comprehension: Following the summary task, participants answered four questions about the data in the documents within 5 minutes. To answer these questions, participants need to be aware of content of the text and tables to give a comprehensive answer. Some example questions used for these tasks include: -Which regions or countries meet their MDG target for 2015 for under-five mortality rate? -Which regions or countries reduced their maternal mortality rates by 50% between 1990 and 2010? -Which regions or countries have a high lifetime risk of maternal death (units: 1 in)? Participants were allowed to use the interactive filtering options to find visualizations of interest and access previously-saved selections during this task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Procedure</head><p>Each user study session started with signing a consent form and completing a demographic survey. The experimenter first trained participants in the assigned interface by demonstrating the visualizations and interactions for reading the document. The participants were then allowed to train on their own, until they were comfortable with the interface. They then read the assigned document on the interface to write the 6-sentence summary. Following the summary task, they completed the four comprehension tasks. Then, they completed a survey on the perceived usability and utility of the interface. They then moved on to the second condition with the other document and repeated the procedure. The sequence of interfaces and documents was counterbalanced across participants. Sessions lasted one hour each.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6">Data Collected</head><p>For both tasks, the time was fixed: 20 min for summarization and 5 minutes for the four comprehension questions on each interface. The following data was collected:</p><p>• Accuracy in answering the comprehension questions.</p><p>• The summary of the documents.</p><p>• Interactions with the text while reading the documents.</p><p>• Think-out-loud feedback.</p><p>• Subjective feedback.</p><p>Each participant wrote down the answers in a provided document. The subjective feedback was collected through a questionnaire. Finally, the interactions performed on the interfaces were recorded, along with the audio, to understand the usage patterns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.7">Pilot Studies</head><p>The comprehension questions, as well as the time assigned for the tasks, were decided through two pilot studies conducted within our research group. After the first pilot, which lasted two hours without the time limits on the summarization task, we decided to fix it to 20 minutes. For comprehension tasks, a 5-minute time limit was chosen to ensure that the participants do not completely reread the documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.8">Data Analysis</head><p>While the accuracy of answers can be verified for comprehension, there are no established metrics to evaluate the summaries. Instead of a pure qualitative analysis, we use two derived measures from the summary that exemplify the role of data in these documents and represent document reading tasks. A summary should cover the main topics in the document. Therefore, we chose breadth of summary to observe the differences between the two conditions. The main topics were manually identified by the study investigators and verified during the pilot studies. Furthermore, the text in the two data-rich documents convey a sample of the data and the user understanding should therefore be developed from both text and tables to better understand the main insights from the document. For this reason, we used number of statements in the summary quoting data from tables, developed from visualizations or by viewing tables, as the second measure. We call these statements, data-rich statements.</p><p>Considering recent concerns with null-hypotheses testing <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20]</ref>, APA recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[60]</ref>, and an example set by the visualization community <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25]</ref>, we focused on estimation techniques to report on effect sizes and confidence intervals, instead of p-value statistics. All point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) are based on 1000 percentile bootstrap replicates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">RESULTS</head><p>Here, we report the results followed by our qualitative observations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Summary: Breadth of Topics</head><p>Our primary derived measure was the number of topics from the original document within the summaries. For both documents, these topics include "comparison of trends over time," "mortality rates of developing and developed regions," "improvements for countries," "projections for the future," "challenges for countries," and "correlation to other indicators." By tagging these topics, we compared Elastic Documents with the conventional viewer <ref type="figure">(Figure 8(left)</ref>). The effect of the interface is strong as the size of the non-overlapping region between the two interfaces is more than 80% for both documents (showcasing a large effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[55]</ref>). Overall, this indicates that Elastic Documents </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Summary: Number of Data-Rich Statements</head><p>We tag a statement in the summary as a data-rich statement if it satisfies one of the following conditions: (1) the statement contains precise numerical facts, (2) the participant pinned a chart and used it to write the statement, (3) the participant consolidated multiple charts to augment the text, or (4) used the data from the table to write it. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> (middle) showcases the effect sizes for Elastic Documents vs. conventional viewer overall as well as for each of the two documents. Overall, summaries from Elastic Documents (Mean 3.73; CI <ref type="bibr">[3.29, 4.21]</ref>) contained more data-rich statements than the conventional interface (Mean 1.29; CI [0.79, 1.86]). This effect is also strong for each individual document, but appears to be at different levels. Example data-rich statements made by participants include:</p><p>"[The] majority of the maternal deaths can be found in 3 developing regions, namely: Sub-saharan Africa, Southern Asia, and Southeastern Asia. Of these 3, Southern Asia and Eastern Asia, had the Elastic Documents Conventional Elastic Documents <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>: Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the derived measures from the user study.</p></div>

(P3)</p><p>"This acceleration [in the improvements in Under-five Mortality rates] is mostly due to developing regions, as the rates over the same two periods <ref type="bibr">[1990]</ref><ref type="bibr">[1991]</ref><ref type="bibr">[1992]</ref><ref type="bibr">[1993]</ref><ref type="bibr">[1994]</ref><ref type="bibr">[1995]</ref><ref type="bibr">[1996]</ref><ref type="bibr">[1997]</ref><ref type="bibr">[1998]</ref><ref type="bibr">[1999]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2000]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2000]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2001]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2002]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2003]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2004]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2005]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2006]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2007]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2008]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2009]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2010]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2011]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2012]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2013]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2014]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2015]</ref> in developed regions actually slowed, from 3.9% per year to 3.5% per year."(P8)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Comprehension: Accuracy of Answers</head><p>Following the summary tasks, participants answered questions regarding the data within the document. Again, there is evidence that Elastic Documents (Mean 0.93; CI [0.86, 0.98]) outperformed the alternative (Mean 0.68; CI [0.55, 0.80]) overall <ref type="figure">(Figure 8(right)</ref>); however, the evidence is slightly weaker for individual documents, and the variance in accuracy is higher for the conventional viewer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Qualitative Observations</head><p>The text within the chosen data-rich documents provides both highlevel discussions on trends and projections in mortality rates as well as details related to specific countries in the developing regions. For the high-level content, the tables provide detailed data to support the claims. For detailed discussions, the tables provide aggregate estimates at regional levels. Here we describe the reading styles in working around these aspects in the presence and absence of visualizations, and describe our observations about the role of visualization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.1">Reading Styles</head><p>Elastic Documents is meant for close reading, where the reader has the option read and reread the document to develop an understanding. This reading pattern is very conducive to visualization as the reader can perceive and interpret simple visualizations when going through the document, in contrast to speed reading or browsing a document. On the conventional interface. Majority of the participants adopted either a skimming reading style or a back-and-forth style: 8 participants read the document in a cursory style to quickly go through the entire content to extract important points, and 4 participants went back and forth between text and tables based on the references in the text to gain a holistic understanding. For the skimming style, some participants never looked at the tables (P6, P7) or missed some attributes in the table (P9). They were then compelled to read parts of the documents again when writing the summary or answering comprehension tasks. For the back-and-forth style, the participants focused on a few attributes and referred to the tables repeatedly so that they do not lose their understanding of the textual content.</p><p>The participants complained that about the layout and content of the document in the conventional viewer: "The document is not very easy to read. There's so much information and data, with only two tables far away from the paragraphs" (P8), and "It was hard to move the page up and down to see the table and going back to the point that I was reading" (P2). Based on their comments, we believe that some participants in this condition felt a missing aspect when reading these documents: when read in a skimming style, they lost track of details and found it hard to understand the statements in text, and when read closely, they felt it was too cognitively challenging.</p><p>To deal with this problem, two participants tried a third reading style (P5, P14; who began their experiment with Elastic Documents). They started reading by directly going through the two tables. Both participants found the task easier than others, but starting with tables and connecting them to text is not sensible especially when the tables become larger (cf. Hurricane Harvey report <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[42]</ref>).</p><p>On the Elastic Documents interface. All participants started by observing the visualizations while reading the document. 9 participants incorporated text highlighting into their reading style: (1) participants P1, P2, P4, and P9 selected every sentence while reading and observed the top of the chart panel, and (2) the other participants selected only sentences that have some data or insight. P2 said, "The interface automatically shows relevant information when I click a sentence, so it sometimes showed me useful information to understand the text." For a few participants, selecting sentences one after another seemed to be second nature they acquired in past digital reading experiences. The selection was carried out to track their progress with no deliberation.</p><p>During summarization, after developing a preliminary idea of the main topics of the document, five participants (P5, P8, P9, P11, P12) went beyond text selection, by filtering on the table attributes to curate the visualizations to their interests. We characterize this as a hybrid reading pattern, where the reader progressively transforms the reading into a more exploratory method. Participants used the line charts to observe trends for the attribute (e.g., maternal deaths) mentioned in the text during other years, and used the bar charts to observe extrema in the statistics, along with reading exact values. Only two participants accessed the actual tables when reading the data-rich documents to gain an overview of all the attributes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.2">Role of Visualizations in Document Reading</head><p>The visualizations played different roles based on the sentence being read and the user's intent. Participants primarily found that the charts augmented the text by showing both the corresponding data and the contextual data. For instance, when reading about Sub-Saharan Africa, the charts included not only data about that region but also information about other regions. They realized this region had the highest mortality rate, which helped them remember the sentence. Sometimes, participants would go through one or two charts before even reading the sentences to observe the data context. After all, visualizations leverage the full capabilities of the high-bandwidth sense of human vision. This complementary nature of visualizations may have helped in document reading to understand the context and develop a more comprehensive summary for the data-rich documents.</p><p>In cases when visualizations were not complementary (maybe due to the lack of good keywords for matching), some participants used filters to highlight specific visualizations to learn the information. Filters were especially useful when writing the summary as they enabled participants to quickly access the specific data values and to quote from the charts they recalled. Visualization along with interaction in this case provided a means to quickly search for information. Since filtering breaks the flow of reading in some cases, the participants wanted the interface to adapt to their interactions. P8 suggested that his previously filtered attributes can be weighed higher for better matches.</p><p>When the visualizations were indeed relevant to a selected sentence, the participants tended to pay more attention to the sentence and more likely would pin the charts to refer to them when writing the summary.  <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>: Participants felt that Elastic Documents was more efficient and useful for reading data-rich documents than the conventional viewer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5">Subjective Ratings</head><p>After each session, the participants rated the interfaces on three metrics: efficiency, ease of use, and usefulness for reading data-rich documents, on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (e.g., strongly disagree) to 5 (e.g., strongly agree). <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> shows the subjective ratings provided by the participants. Elastic Documents outperformed conventional interface in the efficiency and usefulness scale, with almost all participants agreeing that the presence of visualizations aids in reading data-rich documents. For ease of use, they felt that the familiarity of the conventional viewer made it also easy to use (P14). When asked to choose one, all participants preferred Elastic Documents. Finally, while we have not evaluated recall, participants also felt visualizations added to the memorability of the data in the document. P9 said, "Visuals created by elastic documents helped me memorize the facts, also it is easy to search for visualizations and pin the important visuals." However, this needs to be validated further.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">DISCUSSION</head><p>The positive results from the user study as well as the qualitative observations confirm the benefits of Elastic Documents. Here we discuss our results, including their implications as well as their limitations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Limitations and Future Work</head><p>Chart types and text processing. Our Elastic Documents technique for connecting the text and tables focuses on utilizing visualizations to simplify the complex data tables based on the user's focus. To showcase this approach, we chose to utilize two chart types, as well as word extraction and matching algorithms that can apply this approach to the sample documents. To extend this approach to wider use, further research is required to isolate other visual representations-geographical maps, multi-category charts (e.g., stacked bars), and set visualizations-that can aid in reading data-rich documents. Furthermore, more advanced algorithms for keyword extraction and matching-e.g., using word embedding <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>-need to be identified to make the connection between text and tables stronger. Given the benefits of the Elastic Documents approach, this will be our next step in extending the technique. Current implementation. We focused on presenting a proof-ofconcept of our approach to connect text and tables within the document using contextual visualizations. As such, it is currently applied to sample documents available online in PDF format. While doing so, we also relied on an internal tool developed at Adobe that tags elements in a PDF document and converts them to a Document Object Model, which was amenable to the table parsing and extraction methods introduced in this paper. Our approach is not limited to PDF documents, however, and can be applied to any document format. To handle other formats, customized document parsers are necessary. Parsing performance. By developing on previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, we did not evaluate the low-level performance of the table parsing methods. According to Chen and Cafarella <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, the lower bound of the precision of the parsing algorithm is around 81% and the lower bound for recall is around 73% for similar spreadsheets. Errors in table parsing can significantly impact the subsequent visualization generation and linking stages. For example, misidentification of the header structure may result in incorrect table segments and visualization; the match scores may also be inaccurate, which may produce nonsensical order of visualizations. We alleviate these problems partially by supporting search and filtering of the generated visualizations. As a next step, we are investigating techniques that increase the transparency of parsing and allow users to interactively rectify potential errors. Study design. Our evaluation compared two conditions: Elastic Documents vs. a baseline. Our goal in doing so was to compare the Elastic Documents approach to the current interface for data-rich documents. We chose this holistic evaluation method, involving an entirely new document viewer, to ensure ecological validity. It is certainly possible to evaluate intermediate versions of Elastic Documents that isolate the effects of visualization, layout manipulation, and contextual presentation of data. Another interesting idea is to improve our approach by drawing inspiration from the analog paper medium. However, these directions are outside the scope of this paper and left for future studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Implications</head><p>PDF documents could be seen as a dead end for open data, since they are not as suitable for analytics as other serialized formats such as JSON or CSV. However, many organizations-both public and private-publish data-rich documents in the PDF format as it provides a self-contained medium for data-driven storytelling or data archival. Adaptive document viewers have the potential to alleviate the challenges in reading such documents. They can view the data-rich documents in a user interface that fits the reader's specific goal and task. For instance, during cursory reading, many visualizations can be shown to increase the bandwidth, while in active reading, detailed text can be provided along with the visualizations to support annotation.</p><p>Beyond document viewers, Elastic Documents has implications to document creation. New document creation tools can be introduced to help creators add more complete metadata and contextual information to data-rich documents. This can enable better accuracy in adaptive document viewing by eliminating error-prone parsing and inference. One way to realize this idea is to support tagging connected information across content types-not just text and tables but also illustrations and even dynamic content such as animations and videos <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>-semiautomatically through user interaction. For instance, when writing a textual narrative, the creation tool can suggest references to data from tables or parts of figures and insert them based on some user input.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we introduce the Elastic Documents approach for datarich documents. These documents contain multiple content types including text, figures, and complex tables spreading many pages. As a part of this approach, we extract the tables and text from these documents and parse the tables to generate visualizations. These visualizations containing structured data are matched with the user's focus in the text to present the relevant ones. By doing so, the output format of a document is made adaptive to the user's specific interest.</p><p>We evaluated our approach against a conventional document viewer in a laboratory study. Participants covered more topics in their summaries and covered more data-rich statements when using Elastic Documents. The qualitative observations showcase unique reading patterns in the presence of visualizations. While our current implementation is just a prototype, we are currently working towards a more general viewer inspired by Elastic Documents that can connect multiple content types together-rich text, tables, illustrations, and picturesand simplify the reading of data-rich documents.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>(a) Assets of Apple: Hierarchical row headers with total &amp; individual cells.
