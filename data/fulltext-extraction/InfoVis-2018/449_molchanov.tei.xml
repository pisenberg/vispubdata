				<p>Dimensionality reduction is commonly applied to multidimensional data to reduce the complexity of their analysis. In visual analysis systems, projections embed multidimensional data into 2D or 3D spaces for graphical representation. To facilitate a robust and accurate analysis, essential characteristics of the multidimensional data shall be preserved when projecting. Orthographic star coordinates is a state-of-the-art linear projection method that avoids distortion of multidimensional clusters by restricting interactive exploration to orthographic projections. However, existing numerical methods for computing orthographic star coordinates have a number of limitations when putting them into practice. We overcome these limitations by proposing the novel concept of shapepreserving star coordinates where shape preservation is assured using a superset of orthographic projections. Our scheme is explicit, exact, simple, fast, parameter-free, and stable. To maintain a valid shape-preserving star-coordinates configuration during user interaction with one of the star-coordinates axes, we derive an algorithm that only requires us to modify the configuration of one additional compensatory axis. Different design goals can be targeted by using different strategies for selecting the compensatory axis. We propose and discuss four strategies including a strategy that approximates orthographic star coordinates very well and a data-driven strategy. We further present shape-preserving morphing strategies between two shape-preserving configurations, which can be adapted for the generation of data tours. We apply our concept to multiple data analysis scenarios to document its applicability and validate its desired properties.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Datasets typically comprise data samples, each described by a number of characteristics captured in the sample's attributes. The number of attributes defines the data dimensionality. The overall structure of the data can, in general, only be fully understood when exploring all dimensions within the whole set of data attributes. Typical analysis tasks like detecting clusters, trends, and outliers cannot be generally performed in individual attributes. However, the effectiveness of data analysis techniques typically decreases dramatically with increasing dimensionality. This observation motivates the deployment of various dimensionality reduction methods (often referred to as projections), which aim at embedding the original data into a lower-dimensional space with minimal loss of analysis-related information.</p><p>Among other projection techniques, linear projections are known to be a simple, intuitive, fast, and flexible methodology for mapping multidimensional data onto a 2D visual space, which makes them a commonly used approach for user-centric interactive analysis systems. Star coordinates <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> represent a graphical encoding of any linear projection, which supports user interaction and allows for an intuitive exploration of the whole space of linear transformations. Lehmann and Theisel <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> introduced the concept of Orthographic Star Coordinates (OSC), which restricts the traditional star coordinates to the subspace of linear projections preserving shape and multidimensional distances. In particular, multidimensional spheres of radius r are required to be mapped onto 2D discs of the same radius. Several numerical methods were proposed for imposing the formulated conditions to star coordinates.</p><p>Undoubtedly, preservation of shapes of multidimensional structures in projection is a valid and reasonable condition, which is, e.g., significant for cluster analysis tasks. However, it is well known that an increasing data dimensionality results in a rapid growth of distances between samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, cf. curse of dimensionality. Therefore, exact preservation of original distances in projection is neither practical nor really necessary. To preserve shape, it suffices to require that the scaling of distances in the mapping is done isotropically. A scaling value can be easily provided for reference, thus, allowing for a simple calculation of unscaled distances.</p><p>We propose a new numerical technique for restricting star coordinates to the subspace of shape-preserving, i.e., isotropically scaling linear projections. The proposed definition of Shape-preserving Star Coordinates (SPSC) weakens the OSC conditions provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> in a meaningful and desired manner. We demonstrate that such a marginal modification allows for developing a numerical method superior to all existing OSC algorithms. The proposed method is explicit, exact, simple, fast, parameter-free, and stable. Thus, it ideally fits the needs of modern interactive systems for visual analysis of multidimensional data. We discuss the limitations of existing solutions in Section 3.1, present the concept of SPSC in Section 3.3, and analytically derive our scheme that overcomes the listed limitations in Section 3.4. For an easy interpretation of our algorithm we introduce a dual coordinate system in Section 3.5. While preserving shape, our concept has some degree of freedom, which we can exploit by embedding different strategies for interactively updating the SPSC constellation. We present four strategies targeting solutions with different design choices in Section 3.6. In particular, one strategy is to preserve distances, which mimics the OSC idea <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, while having the desired properties listed above. Another strategy considers the properties of the projected data, which up to now has been completely omitted in existing approaches, but should be a natural goal when targeting data analysis. When transitions between two projections, a morphing procedure is necessary, cf. data tours <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. We present a strategy for morphing between SPSC constellations that maintains the SPSC condition, see Section 3.7. We demonstrate how our concept can be embedded in multiple data analysis tasks in Section 4. We test our concept with various strategies, analyze their properties, and discuss their advantages and limitations.</p><p>The main contributions of our paper can be summarized as:</p><p>• We present the concept of SPSC that preserves shape by postulating isotropic scaling. • We derive an analytical solution for the SPSC concept leading to an explicit, exact, simple, fast, parameter-free, and stable scheme. • We present various strategies for implementing the SPSC scheme, which target different design choices. • We mimic OSC behavior with an SPSC strategy.</p><p>• We propose a data-driven SPSC strategy.</p><p>• We propose an SPSC morphing strategy.</p><p>• We construct an exact and stable OSC morphing by a proper scaling of the SPSC morphing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Dimensionality reduction is a standard approach for visual embedding of multidimensional numerical data into a low-dimensional (usually 2D or 3D) space. Many linear and non-linear projection methods have been proposed. Maybe the most prominent schemes are Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multi-dimensional Scaling (MDS). PCA <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref> is a well-established eigenvector-based tool for exploratory data analysis aiming at minimal information loss of data in Euclidean space. MDS <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> is a dimensionality reduction technique that optimizes the data similarity preservation in the low-dimensional space, and can be applied to non-Euclidean data. Recently, other projection methods like the non-linear t-SNE approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> based on neighborhood preservation have become popular. However, such automatic methods try to find one optimal embedding with respect to an optimization criterion, while a full understanding of the data may require the investigation of multiple embeddings <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Multiple views can be obtained using interactive analysis systems, where the projections can be modified interactively by the user, which is what we aim at.</p><p>Various coordinate systems can be chosen for interactive visual analysis of multidimensional data in a 2D visual space. A comparative study of Cartesian and radial visualizations performed by Diehl et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> argued that the former generally outperforms the latter especially in answer times. However, radial layouts seem to be more appropriate when dealing with non-equally important dimensions and might provide a comprehensive metaphor for particular types of data. Several radial visualization methods (RadViz <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, star coordinates <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>, Gravi++ <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, Dust &amp; Magnet <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>) can all be expressed in terms of common notations, as shown by Cheng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. They enhanced the RadViz layout by a non-linear iterative optimizationand reported it to be less ambiguous and more insightful. However, star coordinates use the simplest mapping function based on linear transformations only and avoiding any normalization factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, which results in an intuitive, effective, and efficient visualization method highly suitable for interactive analysis systems. The technique was successfully applied for interactively detecting multidimensional clusters, trends, and outliers with many applications including general classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, medical image segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, visualization of high-density clusters <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, structure detection in volumetric multiattribute fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, and exploration of continuous attribute spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. We improve on the fundamental concept of star coordinates, from which all listed applications may benefit.</p><p>Star coordinates visually encode a linear transformation matrix as a system of 2D vectors corresponding to the dimensions of the multidimensional data. They allow the user to control the currently applied linear projection by changing the positions of the vectors' end-points. Star coordinates perform well for a moderate (up to 15-20) number of dimensions. For truly high-dimensional data, the star-coordinates layout becomes cluttered which hampers interactivity. This issue can be overcome by grouping the axes based on the attribute similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> or by interacting with the projected samples directly <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Improving the attribute values recovery in star-coordinates plots was achieved by appropriate axis calibration <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and a hybrid approach merging star coordinates with principal component biplots <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> was proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>Star coordinates are a very flexible exploration tool since they are able to encode any linear mapping of a multidimensional space to a 2D visual space. However, arbitrary linear projections may introduce large distortions in proximity of data samples. In order to preserve the multidimensional distances in the projection, the star-coordinates configuration should be restricted to a special subclass of linear mappings. This gave rise to developing a notion of OSC by Lehmann and Theisel <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. OSC were first applied for computing orthographic data tours <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, e.g. scatterplot, PCA, and grand tour <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and later for a datadriven approach for finding an optimal set of projections, which allows to compute short and efficient exploratory data tours <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. The various OSC algorithms introduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> suffer from a number of limitations, which we describe in Section 3.1. We show that a less restrictive sub-class of linear mappings, the SPSC, can be used instead to overcome these limitations. Our SPSC approach can then be applied in data analysis scenarios such as projection pursuits <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref> and data tours <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> in the same way as in the listed papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">SHAPE-PRESERVING STAR COORDINATES</head><p>Arbitrary linear mappings do not necessarily preserve shapes of multidimensional clusters in projected views. In particular, points on an nD sphere may be mapped to 2D ellipses of arbitrary aspect ratio and size <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Furthermore, points close to each other in nD may have distant images after projection. This hampers a reliable interpretation of projected data and has served as a motivation for developing OSC. In the following, we briefly recall the main idea of the original OSC approach, before we propose a novel shape-preserving technique, which shares the motivation of OSC but successfully overcomes the limitations of existing numerical solutions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Limitations of Existing Solutions</head><p>Let data sample m = (m 1 , . . . , m n ) T ∈ R n be projected to point p = (p x , p y ) ∈ R 2 by a linear projection p = A m, where A is a (2 × n)matrix given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A = x y ≡ x 1 x 2 . . . x n y 1 y 2 . . . y n .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The 2D-vectors</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x i = (x i , y i ), i = 1, .</formula><p>. . , n, form a star-coordinates system, which is typically graphically represented by drawing n arrows or lines from origin (0, 0) to the end-points (x i , y i ). By interactively moving the end-points of these vectors in 2D, the user changes the entries of the corresponding column of the projection matrix A, thus exploring the entire space of linear mappings from R n to R 2 . OSC proposed by Lehmann and Theisel <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> impose orthogonality by the following conditions for entries of matrix A</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">x • y = 0, (2) x 2 = 1, y 2 = 1,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where • denotes the scalar (or inner) product. Note that linear projections corresponding to bivariate scatterplots, PCA plots, and the default radial configuration of star coordinates (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1a</ref>) all satisfy conditions (2) and (3). During interaction with star coordinates, the user changes the projection matrix and possibly breaks the imposed conditions. Several techniques were presented to restore the OSC conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>: The first approach is based on the Gram-Schmidt reconditioning (GSR method). The method is simple and fast. Unfortunately, the positions of all star-coordinates axes including the one interacted by the user are changed during the reconditioning. Thus, the whole star-coordinates configuration is distorted in a manner that is not transparent or obvious for the user, which is often undesirable. This effect was confirmed in tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and a conclusion on "limited practicability" of the method was drawn. The second, more sophisticated technique utilizes the following error functional</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">e(A) = (x • y) 2 + ( x 2 − 1) 2 + ( y 2 − 1) 2 ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>which serves as a measure for the current linear projection to be orthographic in the sense of Equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. The OSC restoration process is then based on a minimization of the error functional <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. Although allowing for an analytical solution (AS method), this approach also updates the positions of all coordinate axes (again including the interacted axis). Moreover, Lehmann and Theisel reported a growing error e(A) during interactions due to "a numerical effect of instability caused by enduringly solving a linear system". Finally, it was proposed to restrict the degrees of freedom for the axes allowing, in particular, to fix the position of certain axes during the OSC restoration process. This was achieved by equipping the error functional expression (4) with a few new weighted terms. Minimization of the resulting error functional is then performed either by applying a steepest descent optimization (SDO method) or by an iterative reconditioning (IR method). Unfortunately, no explicit conclusion was drawn, which of the numerical methods is generally beneficial or preferred.</p><p>Weaknesses and disadvantages of the existing approaches can be summarized as follows:</p><p>• Unpredictable change of the star-coordinates configuration including the interacted axis and respective change in the projected samples distribution deteriorates the user experience for an intuitive and effective data exploration process (GSR, IR, and AS methods).</p><p>• Numerical instability of computations leads to an increasing error potentially breaking OSC (AS method). • Computational times are increased for iterative algorithms or when solving a linear system (AS, SDO, and IR methods).</p><p>• Orthographic conditions or axes restrictions are not satisfied exactly, especially during morphing (AS, SDO, and IR methods).</p><p>• The user needs to specify parameters for numerical methods, e.g.</p><p>the steepest descend step size, the number of iterations, or the weights of the error terms (SDO and IR methods). No study on optimal parameter choice was presented. • The user needs to individually restrict the axes displacements (fix, radial, or directional), which is neither intuitive nor efficient for larger number of dimensions (SDO and IR methods).</p><p>• Behavior of solutions for contradicting user input, e.g., when the length of an axis becomes larger than 1, is not examined. Thus, bad initial configuration of star coordinates may potentially lead to degeneration during OSC restoration (all methods). Moreover, the presented methods (except GSR) are not easy to implement. Finally, all OSC restoration techniques are completely decoupled from the data analyzed, although accurate and effective analysis of data is the overall motivation. In Section 3.4, we present our explicit method for restoring the SPSC condition (introduced in Section 3.3), which overcomes the listed limitations.</p><p>An orthography-preserving morphing between two different OSC with orthographic projection matrices A and B (such as in data tours) is constructed by restoring OSC from intermediate steps of a linear blending over time t ∈ [0, 1] with P(t) = (1 − t) A + t B, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. However, P(t) can degenerate, which leads to any OSC-restoration method failing. A trivial example is B = −A, for which P(0.5) has all elements vanishing. Moreover, it was never shown that the energy minimization methods necessarily result in a continuous morphing between A and B when applied to P(t). We address the problem of existence and continuity of the shape-preserving morphing in Section 3.7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Visual Representation</head><p>We would like to start with some observations and notes on the scaling of attribute values in star-coordinates layouts. In multidimensional data analysis, different dimensions are typically considered to be comparable with each other. Along with this strong assumption, the values of each attribute are usually normalized to belong to a fixed interval, e.g., <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1]</ref> or [−1, 1], although many methods like PCA and MDS are extremely sensitive to such normalizations. It is easy to see, that the image of a data sample m ∈ [0, 1] n ⊂ R n when applying an orthographic projection satisfying Equations (2) and (3) belongs to a 2D disk of radius √ n centered at the origin. E.g.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">for x = (n −1/2 , . . . , n −1/2 ), y = (n −1/2 , . . . , n −1/2 n/2 times , −n −1/2 , . . . , −n −1/2 n/2 times ),</formula><p>and When rotating the proposed star-coordinates system (x, y) T around the origin, the image (p x , p y ) of point m with maximal value in all attributes moves on the 2D circle of radius √ n. In other words, assuming a scaling of the data attributes to a fixed interval, the projected samples' range grows depending on the dimensionality n of the original data. Therefore, when showing the star-coordinates axes and projected data as a scatterplot in the same view, either one displays all data including possibly interesting outliers having extreme attribute values, which makes the rendering of the star-coordinates axes small and cluttered and interaction with the axes difficult, or one zooms in on the starcoordinates axes, which may lead to the outliers leaving the rendering domain and not being shown anymore. Scaling the original data attribute values to [−n 1/2 , n 1/2 ] n eliminates this problem. However, the view remains cluttered especially for bigger dimensionality n and larger datasets. Therefore, we prefer to show star coordinates and projected data in two separate linked views. The linked views support interactivity and simplify the exploration process, since, e.g., a zooming can be applied to the projected scatterplot view for investigating details while keeping the star-coordinates axes at their desired zoom level and, thus, fully accessible for interactions. As a positive side effect, the linked views allow us to enhance the visual representation of the star-coordinates axes view without polluting the projected scatterplot view with additional clutter. We propose to show the circle of unit length, which serves as a reference for the axes' lengths. In addition, we incorporate a stylized dial of a clock, see left column of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. The intersection points of the (virtually extended) star-coordinates axes with the unit circle are shown as small squares using the same color as for the respective axis. This helps the user in estimating the angles between axes, especially when the axes are short. For example, if the user wants to set two axes orthogonal to each other, the user can use the dial as a hint for more precise placement of the axes' end-points.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">m = (1, 1, . . . , 1) T ∈ [0, 1] n , we obtain x = 1, y = 1, (x, y) = 0, (i.e.,<label>(2)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Shape Preservation</head><p>Following up on the discussion of the global scaling of the views, we have observed that the original data attributes are normalized before processing and positions of the projected samples may be isotropically scaled in order to use the screen space efficiently. Hence, the constant 1 in condition (3) of the OSC loses its meaning and can be replaced by any positive constant C ∈ R such that condition (3) becomes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">x 2 = C 2 , y 2 = C 2 .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Since C is arbitrary and its value is not of importance, we can rewrite the Equations (5) as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">x 2 = y 2 .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>With this derivation, we can define SPSC as star coordinates with linear projections that satisfy conditions (2) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. Here, we especially emphasize that the performed slight modification of Equation (3) still fully satisfies the initial requirement to preserve high-dimensional geometry shapes in the projection plane, as the scaling is still isotropic. Obviously, the OSC conditions are stronger than the SPSC conditions and the valid OSC configurations are a subset of the valid SPSC configurations. However, every SPSC configuration (x, y) T with length scaling C &gt; 0 given by Equations (5) can be transformed into (C −1 x, C −1 y) T , which satisfies conditions (2) and (3) and, therefore, is a valid OSC configuration. We use this property for constructing an orthographic morphing between two OSC configurations in Section 3.7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Explicit Analytical Solution</head><p>Without loss of generality, we assume that the user interacts with the first axis x 1 (to which we refer as the interacted axis) changing its end-point's position by (x 1 , y 1 ) → (x 1 , y 1 ). Obviously, at least one of SPSC conditions (2) and (6) is violated by this modification, if all other axes remain unchanged. To compensate for the interaction effect and to restore the SPSC conditions, we have to adjust the configuration of the other axes. Since we want to leave the configurations of other axes apart from the interacted one unchanged as much as possible, we propose to adjust the configuration of one single axis (with index k = 1), which we refer to as the compensatory axis. The choice of the compensatory axis leaves us with a degree of freedom, which we can use for various strategies to fulfill different design goals, cf. Section 3.6. In order to determine the new position x k for the end-point of the compensatory axis, we rewrite the SPSC conditions (2) and (6) for the updated star coordinates as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">x 1 y 1 + x k y k + ∑ i =1,i =k x i y i = 0, (x 1 ) 2 + (x k ) 2 + ∑ i =1,i =k x 2 i = (y 1 ) 2 + (y k ) 2 + ∑ i =1,i =k y 2 i ,</formula><p>or equivalently</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">x k y k = x 1 y 1 − x 1 y 1 + x k y k − n ∑ i=1 x i y i =: C 1,k ,<label>(7)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">(x k ) 2 − (y k ) 2 = x 2 1 − y 2 1 − (x 1 ) 2 − (y 1 ) 2 + x 2 k − y 2 k − n ∑ i=1 x 2 i − y 2 i =: C 2,k .<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Note that the sums in both equations vanish if the system had satisfied the SPSC conditions before the user interaction. Since we assumed that we started with a valid SPSC configuration, the computations of parameters C 1,k and C 2,k simplify to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">C 1,k = x 1 y 1 − x 1 y 1 + x k y k , C 2,k = x 2 1 − y 2 1 − (x 1 ) 2 − (y 1 ) 2 + x 2 k − y 2 k .</formula><p>An explicit solution of system (7)-(8) is provided by</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">(x k ) 2 = C 2,k + C 2 2,k + 4C 2 1,k 2, (y k ) 2 = −C 2,k + C 2 2,k + 4C 2 1,k 2.<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Note that the right-hand sides of Equations (9) are non-negative for any values C 1,k ,C 2,k ∈ R, thus the existence of a solution is guaranteed. Of course, if x k is a valid solution, −x k obeys the equations, as well. Randomly choosing one of the two solutions may lead to discontinuity during the evolution of the star-coordinates interactions due to axes that may suddenly flip their orientation. The simplest, yet robust approach to avoid suddenly flipping axes of SPSC is to choose the sign such that the new position x k is closest to the old position x k . The proposed restoration of the SPSC conditions based on solution (9) is explicit and therefore extremely fast, stable, and exact. It is parameter-free (when assuming a well-defined strategy for choosing the compensatory axis, see Section 3.6) and affects only the configuration of the compensatory axis. Finally, its implementation is trivial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Dual Coordinate System</head><p>In this section, we first give a geometrical interpretation for Equations (2) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. For illustration, we use an artificial dataset with 20, 000 random samples uniformly distributed on the surface of the unit sphere in R 5 . Under projection defined by the default radial configuration of star coordinates, which is orthographic and consequently also shape-preserving, the multidimensional data points are projected onto a disk of radius 1, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 1a and 1b</ref>. Each of the Equations (2) and (6) defines a hyperbolic curve in R 2 for each pair of coordinates (x j , y j ). Where the hyperbolae intersect, both conditions are satisfied, i.e., the constellation is shape-preserving. Two symmetric intersection points of the hyperbolae exist, which define the valid constellations of an axis to form an SPSC configuration assuming that other axes are fixed. The curves for axis attr1 are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1(a)</ref>. When moving the respective axis along one of these curves, the respective condition still holds, while the other condition is broken, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 1c and 1e</ref>. Accordingly, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 1d and 1f</ref>, we observe how the shape of the 5D sphere is projected to 2D ellipses instead of 2D disks. To compensate for the movement of the interacted axis, a second compensating axis needs to be moved to restore the SPSC conditions. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1(g)</ref>, axis attr2 is moved to the closer intersection point of the respective hyperbolae shown in green. The change of the compensatory axis attr2 affects the hyperbolae of the interacted axis attr1 shown in purple. Once the position of the end-point of the compensatory axis attr2 is set to the intersection of the green hyperbolae, one of the intersection points of the purple hyperbolae coincides with the end-point of the interacted axis attr1. Hence, the star-coordinates constellation is, again, shape-preserving, cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>(h) (but not orthographic, as the radius of the disk is 0.898).</p><p>Second, we propose a transformation into a dual coordinate system, which allows for a more intuitive geometric interpretation of the compensatory movement. Following Equations (2) and (6), we perform a change of 2D coordinates (x, y) → (u, v) according to formulae u = x y and v = x 2 − y 2 . In this dual coordinate system, the hyperbolic curves become axis-aligned straight lines and the unit circle is mapped to itself. Let the end-points of the star-coordinate axes {x i } be mapped to a set of locations {u i }. Then, fulfilling conditions (2) and (6) is equivalent to the barycenter of {u i } coinciding with the origin of the dual coordinate system. Therefore, in order to preserve the SPSC conditions when interacting with the axis with index 1, the compensatory axis with index k should be moved such that the midpoint (u 1 + u k )/2 remains at its original position. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> illustrates the changes in constellations of the interacted axis shown in light blue and the compensatory axis shown in pink in original and dual coordinates. We can observe that the two pairs of hyperbolae become two pairs of orthogonal lines in the dual coordinate system and how the midpoint of the modified axes' end-point is staying fixed. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Strategies for Interactive Changes</head><p>When interacting with axis x 1 , the choice of a compensatory axis x k , k = 1, depends on the user's intention, the analysis task, and the properties of data. We propose four meaningful strategies that reflect different design choices. Fixed setup. The user is free to fix any k = 1. This may be useful when the interplay of axis x k with other attributes is to be explored. It is worth mentioning again that the locations of the axes' end-points are not restricted to lie within the unit circle. Thus, when the user pulls the end-point of axis x 1 outside the unit circle to make the axis longer and longer, the compensatory axis x k needs to counteract by also increasing its length and tends to be extended in a direction orthogonal to the interacted axis. Therefore, for increasing lengths of the two axes, the resulting data layout in the projection space converges to a bivariate scatterplot for dominant attributes 1 and k, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>. Best length scaling. Generally, solution (9) results in SPSC with some length scaling parameter C ≥ 0, see Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">5</ref>. The second strategy we present tries to mimic the OSC behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. We want to document that this is possible, despite our argumentation that orthographic behavior is not necessary for shape preservation, becomes meaningless when working with separate linked views, and is not guaranteed to hold exactly in existing iterative OSC methods. To implement this strategy, k can be dynamically determined by the system in order to keep the value of C close to unity. Thus, the choice of the compensatory axis is not fixed anymore, but changes during interaction. Results in Section 4 demonstrate that |1 −C| &lt; 0.01 is achieved for all presented examples when applying this strategy. Varying C smoothly during interaction is similar to a continuous zooming without distortion. The best length scaling strategy minimizes this zooming effect. Least distortion of star coordinates. Our third strategy is motivated by the observation that the user would typically prefer to exactly preserve the positions of all axes except for the interacted one like in classical (not shape-preserving) star coordinates. This would allow for investigating the role of each attribute individually and independently. Aiming at a similar user experience for SPSC, k may be chosen automatically to secure the least distortion of the current SPSC configuration, i.e., minimizing x k − x k . Again, k is not fixed during interaction, but we always pick the k that minimizes the distortion of the constellation. This strategy provides a slower movement of compensatory axes and, consequently, makes it easier for the user to track all changes. Least distortion of projected data. All existing methods for restoring OSC are solely based on the configuration of the axes and, thus, neglect the distribution and properties of the analyzed multidimensional data. We believe that visual analysis tools should be designed to obey data characteristics and should adapt to the given data where possible. Thus, in our fourth strategy we propose to choose k such that the movement of x k (when considered separate from the movement of x 1 caused by the user interaction) would lead to the least possible changes in the positions of the projected data samples. We aim at minimizing</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">1 N ∑ j A new m j − A old m j = 1 N ∑ j (x k − x k ) m jk = (x k − x k ) 1 N ∑ j m jk ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where m j denotes the data samples and N their total number. Alternatively, one could penalize large displacements of individual samples by using squared distances, i.e, we would minimize</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">1 N ∑ j A new m j − A old m j 2 = (x k − x k ) 2 1 N ∑ j m 2 jk .<label>(11)</label></formula><p>Here, the last sum is the second moment of the k-th attribute values, which like the sum in (10) can be pre-computed in a preprocessing step.</p><p>The list of the strategies above is not complete. Other approaches are well possible depending on the application and may, for example, consider similarity of data attributes, cluster separation, or positions of control points in the projection domain. In fact, the strategies can be freely combined and changed on-the-fly. For example, the least distortion of projected data strategy can be replaced by the best length scaling one as soon as the length scaling factor exceeds a certain critical value. It is also possible to use several compensatory axes, see Section 3.7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7">Shape-preserving Morphing</head><p>Star coordinates provide a very flexible tool for controlling the current projection matrix. The user can interactively explore the interplay of dimensions by changing the constellation of the axes corresponding to data attributes. On the other hand, when the projection matrix is evolved algorithmically, the star coordinates intuitively encode the current projection operator. The user can track the changes of the projection during run-time, which supports interpreting the transformations of projected data. Data tours are a well-known example of such projection-steering algorithms. In data tours, a sequence of most interesting projections is generated according to some criteria. A continuous path in the space of projective operators through elements of the sequence is computed yielding a continuous transformation of the projected data in the form of an animation, which requires a continuous morphing between two projections.</p><p>For a robust and accurate data exploration, all of the identified interesting projections should belong to the class of SPSC. When morphing between two of these projections, we require that all intermediate projections also satisfy conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. Note that morphing between two OSC is usually achieved by iteratively solving a minimization problem for all intermediate projections, which leads to an increased computational burden, may lead to numerical instabilities, and delivers an approximation to the exact solution only. Below, we propose a morphing strategy for a pair of SPSC, which inherits simplicity and stability of solution (9).</p><p>Given two shape-preserving projections A and B, we wish to continuously transform one to another without breaking the imposed conditions by constructing a sequence of shape-preserving linear projections {A s } r s=0 for some r, such that subsequent projections A s and A s+1 are close to each other, A 0 = A, and A r = B. A simple and stable solution is to smoothly move every axis x j to its target position x j,r one by one. We propose to proceed first with the axes, which are most distant from their target positions, and move them with constant speed according to the formula</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">x j,s+1 = x j,s + δ x j,r − x j,s x j,r − x j,s .<label>(12)</label></formula><p>Here, parameter δ determines how fast x j,s+1 approaches x j,r . In each step, the index of a compensatory axis k is chosen so that the compensatory axis also approaches its target, i.e.,</p><p>x k,s+1 − x k,r − x k,s − x k,r → min. Then, the morphing converges for arbitrary A and B.</p><p>When the data dimensionality increases, the proposed morphing strategy requires proportionally more iterations to complete, since only a single axis moves directly towards its target in each step. For larger numbers of axes, it is beneficial to move several axes at each iteration simultaneously. Such active axes change their positions according to Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. In the same iteration, we need to restore conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. To maintain a gradual evolution of the star-coordinates configuration, it is beneficial to have the compensatory movement distributed among several axes. Then, we move all the axes according to Equations (9) with slightly modified expressions for C 1,k and C 2,k :</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">C 1,k = x k y k − ω k n ∑ i=1 x i y i ,<label>(13)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">C 2,k = x 2 k − y 2 k − ω k n ∑ i=1 x 2 i − y 2 i ,<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where n ∑ k=1 ω k = 1. In our tests, ω k = 0 for all of q active axes and ω k = (n − q) −1 for others. Thus, we move the active axes strictly towards their target positions and distribute the compensation movement among others.</p><p>The number of active axes is arbitrary. As this number increases, one may expect a faster convergence of the morphing. In an extreme case, a single axis can compensate a movement of n − 1 active axes. However, such a morphing may exhibit jagged trajectories of the compensatory axis due to strong compensatory adjustments. Such distortions may also occur when frequently changing the active set. In our tests, we leave the set of active axes unchanged until all active axes reach their target positions.</p><p>Finally, we can compute the length scaling C s for all shapepreserving operators A s from the morphing sequence. Thus, when given two OSC with C 0 = C r = 1, the sequence</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">C −1 s A s r s=0</formula><p>is an orthographic morphing sequence, i.e., every matrix C −1 s A s satisfies conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. Existence and continuity of the SPSC morphing follows from the analytical solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. The SPSC configuration may degenerate if the scaling length C vanishes, but this may happen only when all star-coordinates axes approach the origin (0, 0) simultaneously. This situation can be easily avoided during interaction or morphing by temporarily freezing one non-degenerate axis. We refer to the accompanying video for a morphing between A and −A. As long as C s &gt; 0, the scaled SPSC sequence C −1 s A s is a valid continuous OSC morphing between any orthographic mappings A and B. Thus, we have developed an exact, computationally fast, and algorithmically simple method for constructing an OSC morphing sequence satisfying conditions from <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> by multiplying the shape-preserving matrices with proper scalars.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.8">Complexity and Scalability</head><p>When comparing to existing methods in terms of computational efficiency, the proposed method is comparable with the reconditioning method and is definitely much faster than any iterative optimization approaches. This comes directly from the fact that computing Equations (9) requires just a few arithmetic and algebraic operations. When assuming a fixed compensatory axis, no further computations are required. When using a strategy that finds the optimal compensatory axis according to some strategy, we need to find and compare solutions for all axes, which results in a linear time complexity in the number of axes. Note that it does not depend on the data size. In summary, we can operate on arbitrarily large data, which can be projected and rendered on the screen at interactive frame rates, see accompanying video.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">EXPERIMENTS</head><p>We applied our technique to the following well-known datasets from the UCI machine learning repository <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>:</p><p>• "Ecoli" dataset, 336 samples, 5 non-binary scalar attributes;</p><p>• "Auto MPG" dataset, 392 samples, 5 non-binary scalar attributes;</p><p>• "Parkinsons" dataset, 197 samples, 22 real-valued attributes;</p><p>• "Wine" dataset, 178 samples, 13 scalar attributes; We also used the "Stanford Bunny" dataset, courtesy of the Stanford University Computer Graphics Laboratory, in the accompanying video to illustrate the basic idea of SPSC. We down-sampled the data by taking every tenth sample from the dataset and interpreted the samples' spatial coordinates as 3 scalar attributes. All other datasets are preprocessed prior to applying any projection method by normalizing each attribute such that the resulting values have 0 mean and belong to [−1, 1]. In case of labeled data, membership information is visually encoded as colors of projected samples using a categorical color map.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Experiment 1: Selecting a Compensatory Axis</head><p>First, we compare SPSC with different strategies for selecting a compensatory axis with traditional star coordinates. We start with the configuration of star coordinates corresponding to the 2D PCA plot for the "Ecoli" dataset. Then, we incrementally extend axis gvh by half of its length in 50 steps of equal size. The orientation of the axis remains the same. When using traditional star coordinates, the projected samples would change their positions parallel to the direction of axis gvh proportionally to their values of attribute gvh. In particular, no displacements of the projected samples in the direction orthogonal to the direction of axis gvh take place in traditional star coordinates. In SPSC, samples are additionally moved due to an adjustment of the compensatory axis in each step. We compute such compensatory displacements of the projected samples in Euclidean metric and encode their magnitudes d i in color in the resulting projected views for the different strategies. We compute l ∞ -, l 1 -, and l 2 -norms of <ref type="figure">vector (d 0 , . . . , d N )</ref>. The best length scaling strategy led to a compensatory movement of the end-point of the single axis mcg and largest compensatory displacements in all norms <ref type="figure">(Figures 4c and 4d)</ref>. However, the deviation of the scaling length value from 1 was minimal. The least distortion of star coordinates strategy resulted in approximately equal adjustments of all non-interacted axes, see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>(e). The compensatory displacements of the projected samples were moderate <ref type="figure">(Figure 4(f)</ref>). The least deviation from traditional star coordinates in all norms was achieved when selecting the least distortion of projected data strategy <ref type="figure">(Figure 4(h)</ref>) minimizing <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, which confirms that this strategy is indeed reducing projected data distortion when compared to other strategies. Two compensatory axes (mcg and alm2) were adjusted to keep the star-coordinates configuration shape preserving, see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>(g). Thus, the least distortion of projected data strategy may be of use when performing a sensitivity analysis of the projection layout for a particular star-coordinate axis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Experiment 2: Comparison with OSC</head><p>Next, we investigate the evolution of scaling length and error functional (4) for different strategies for selecting a compensatory axis using the "Wine" dataset. The initial configuration of the star coordinates corresponds again to the 2D PCA projection, see <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>(b). The interacted axis alc is moved along a closed curve, the Gerono lemniscate given by x = a cost and y = a sint cost for t ∈ [0, 2π], which is scaled and rotated such that the initial axis' end-point corresponds to t = 0, see <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>(a). In case of the fixed setup, axis acid serves as a compensatory axis. Trajectories of the axes' end-points and resulting configurations of SPSC after interaction when using our four strategies are presented in <ref type="figure">Figures 5(c)</ref>-5(f). The fixed setup strategy brings the configuration exactly to its initial state, since the interaction path is closed. This is exact by design, as the compensatory axis is always the same. When the compensatory axis is not fixed, there is no guarantee that the end configuration is equivalent to the start configuration. The least distortion of star coordinates leaves all axes close to their initial positions over all iteration steps. When choosing the least distortion of projected data strategy, only two axes (prol and hue) change their positions noticeably. These compensatory axes result in minimal possible changes in the projected view, thus the movement of the interacted axis alc mostly determines the transformation of the projected data. Finally, the best length scaling strategy leads to SPSC with C ≈ 1, thus providing a very good approximation to the OSC. <ref type="figure">Figure 6(a)</ref> shows an evolution of the length scaling. Points, at which the curves are not smooth, correspond to steps, at which the selection of the compensatory axis was changed. The fixed setup strategy assumes a constant index k, thus, the corresponding curves (orange) are globally smooth.</p><p>For better comparison with original OSC, we also track the evolution of error functional (4) from <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>(b). The best length scaling strategy results in maximal values of e(A) of order 10 −5 . Lehmann and Theisel <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> reported values of order 10 −3 -10 −4 for existing energy minimization methods. Thus, we achieve similar or better behavior of e(A) with significantly less computational efforts. Here, we explicitly emphasize, that strategies that produce length scalings close to 1 or values for e(A) close to 0 are not considered as being better strategies. They are only better when we aim for OSC, which is only one possible aim (corresponding to the best length scaling strategy).</p></div>

Thus, we are able to compute an orthographic morphing between two OSC configurations avoiding iterative methods and numerical instabilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Experiment 4: Data Tour</head><p>We performed a partial PCA data tour using SPSC and scaled SPSC morphing procedures for the "Auto MPG" dataset. A PCA data tour computes an n-dimensional PCA and then provides an iterative morphing between different 2D views that are obtained by using two of the principal components and exchanging the used principal components after each morphing procedure. Let v 1 , ..., v n be the principal components sorted according to the magnitudes of the associated eigenvalues (decreasing order).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Experiment 5: Active Axes During Morphing</head><p>Finally, we tested how the number of active axes affects the speed of morphing. When morphing between the default radial star-coordinates layout and a star-coordinates configuration corresponding to the 2D PCA, we count the number of steps required for different number of active axes. All active axes moved towards their target positions with δ = 0.015. The results for the "Parkinsons" dataset are presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 8</ref>(b). We found that the optimal fraction of active axes is one-quarter to one-third of the total number of dimensions. For lower numbers the morphing is slower, while for larger numbers one may observe artifacts due to large compensatory adjustments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION</head><p>In this paper, we presented a novel technique for restricting traditional star coordinates to a set of shape-preserving linear projections.

Linear-blending trajectories between a default radial star-coordinates system and a PCA configuration are shown in (a).

The blue curve corresponding to the scaled SPSC morphing is bounded by 7.22 • 10 −31 from above, which demonstrates that the scaled SPSC coincides with the OSC.</p><p>patterns, e.g., shapes of multidimensional clusters, in the projection view. Since any orthographic mapping is shape-preserving, SPSC extend the set of OSC configurations <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> by meaningfully weakening the OSC conditions. We introduced a dual system of coordinates for a simple geometrical interpretation of the imposed algebraic conditions. Restoring the SPSC conditions is performed using explicit, exact, simple, and parameter-free formulae, thus a number of limitations of existing numerical methods for restoration of OSC are overcome. In particular, the proposed method is fast and stable and the end-points of the star-coordinates axes are not restricted to lie inside the unit circle. To maintain the shape-preserving property of the star-coordinates configuration, we adjust the configuration of a single compensatory axis. The selection of compensatory axis can be achieved targeting  Depending on the number of active axes, the morphing takes different number of steps to complete, see (b). Choosing the number of axes between 5 and 9 provides a reasonable balance between the morphing speed and its gradual behavior. different design goals. We proposed and tested several strategies for selecting a compensatory axis. The fixed setup strategy allows for the user to fix the compensatory axis and to keep the configuration of other axes unchanged during the interactions. We showed how bivariate scatterplots can be recovered using this strategy. The best length scaling strategy allows for effective approximation of OSC at significantly less computational costs. Two strategies -least distortion of star coordinates and least distortion of projected data -serve to minimize the side effect of the restoration process, when compensatory displacements of the star-coordinates axes and the projected samples take place. Thus, the behavior of the traditional star coordinates during the user interaction is approximated. The latter strategy adapts the SPSC restoration mechanism to the properties of the multidimentional data. To our knowledge, this is the first data-driven strategy. On demand, different strategies of selecting a compensatory axis can be combined or new strategies can be developed. Therefore, flexible adaptivity to application and analysis tasks is a build-in property of the proposed approach. Finally, we presented strategies for morphing between two SPSC configurations. We addressed the problem of existence and continuity of such a morphing. We showed that a proper isotropic scaling of the star-coordinates configuration transforms the shape-preserving morphing to accurate orthographic morphing provided the start-and end-configurations are OSC. The techniques are extended for computing data tours. We showed that several axes can serve as active and compensatory axes in a single morphing step for high dimensionality n.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>SPSC on synthetic dataset of uniformly sampled 20, 000 random points at surface of 5D sphere.
