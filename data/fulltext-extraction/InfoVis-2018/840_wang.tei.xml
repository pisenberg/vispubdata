<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Visual attributes like size, shape, and slope greatly influence the expressiveness and effectiveness of a visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. In particular, the aspect ratio (defined as the fraction, height/width, throughout the paper) has a dramatic effect on the perception of data patterns in a visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. A well-chosen aspect ratio may reveal trends and relevant clusters that are hidden by a bad aspect ratio. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 1</ref> demonstrates the influence of the aspect ratio. An improper aspect ratio obscures the oscillations over the cycles <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 1 (a, b)</ref>) and leads to a poor visual cluster separation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 1 (d)</ref>). In contrast, an appropriate aspect ratio attempts to reveal major patterns as much as possible <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 1</ref> (c, e)). Therefore, methods for automatically choosing a proper aspect ratio for a given visualization are of high interest for a broad range of visualizations and applications.</p><p>Selecting appropriate aspect ratios for 2D line charts has been well studied. Cleveland et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> pioneered the principle of banking to 45 • and proposed two methods: average absolute orientation (AO) and arc length weighted average absolute orientation (AWO). Both methods select aspect ratios by banking the orientation of a line chart's line segments at around 45 degrees. AWO generally produces reasonable aspect ratios for most data. Guha and Cleveland <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and Talbot et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> suggested two alternative approaches: the resultant vector (RV) and arc length based (AL) methods, based on geometric measures such as the resultant vector and the curve's arc length, respectively. Recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> showed that both methods tend to satisfy the banking to 45 • principle and select almost the same aspect ratio as AWO, while RV is usually faster and more robust.</p><p>However, all aforementioned methods are specifically designed for line charts and cannot handle other common 2D visualizations such as scatter plots. To facilitate scatter plots, Fink et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> selected aspect ratios based on a Delaunay triangulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Various geometric criteria were employed, e.g., large minimum angle and total edge length. However, due to the lack of a perceptual foundation, aspect ratios selected by this method might not be favoured by users for certain datasets. Moreover, it is relatively slow; as reported in the paper, it requires several minutes to compute the aspect ratio for a scatter plot with 1,000 points. Talbot et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> proposed an isoline-based approach to selecting aspect ratios by applying existing methods to 2D isolines extracted from the density field derived from a scatter plot. This method can find proper aspect ratios for most data; however, it depends on (i) the number of isolines extracted from the density field and (ii) the quality of the density field constructed from the data. Insufficient isolines or an improper kernel for estimating the density field <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> might result in undesirable aspect ratios that obscure patterns in the data.</p><p>In this paper, we present a generalized image-based approach for finding aspect ratios for 2D diagrams such as scatter plots, density function plots, and line charts. If the input data is not given in the form of a density field but as discrete geometric points, we construct such a field by kernel density estimation (KDE) with Gaussian kernels. In contrast to previous methods, our approach works directly with density fields defined over 2D visualizations without the need to generate intermediate data such as the isolines; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>. We formulate our approach based on Federer's co-area formula <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> in geometric measure theory to transform line integrals over sets of isolines of the density field to area integrals over the density field itself. Using our formulation, previous methods that can be rewritten as line integrals can be extended to work directly with density fields. In addition, to faithfully characterize data patterns, we introduce anisotropic KDE to construct the density fields, where the kernel associated with each data point adapts to the local structure around the point.</p><p>Compared to conventional isoline-based approaches, our method also follows the principle of banking to 45 • , but it avoids discrete isolines as intermediate data and works directly with the density fields. Hence, it achieves an accurate and fast computation. Since density fields are often continuous and even smooth, directly computing the aspect ratios from them avoids the limitations of existing methods, e.g., they cannot handle data with spike noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 1</ref> (b)). Moreover, our approach is not limited to using a density field of a discrete visualization but can be applied to any non-negative and unnormalized field. Hence, we refer to our approach as an image-based approach, and thus, it not only encompasses cases that can be handled by the previous methods, but can also be applied more broadly to continuous scatter plots and even to 2D images in general.</p><p>As shown by Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, AWO, AL, and RV can be formulated using line integrals; hence, they can be extended to work directly with density fields. Comparing our image-based versions of these methods with previous isoline-based versions with a large number of isolines, we recommend our method, image-based RV (imgRV), as the default aspect ratio selection method, since it produces results similar to most of the other methods but is the fastest and the most robust. We revisit examples and the user study by Fink et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and show that choices made by our method are mostly consistent with user preferences.</p><p>Last, we show three extensions of our method including region-ofinterest (ROI) banking, multi-scale banking, and using images as an input. We summarize the main contributions of our paper below.</p><p>• We present a new aspect ratio selection approach that works directly with density fields constructed from a broad range of 2D visualizations. Three image-based aspect ratio selection methods are formulated by extending the line integral forms of existing methods AWO, AL, and RV.</p><p>• We introduce anisotropic kernels to better characterize the local structures in the data visualizations.</p><p>• We provide a comprehensive evaluation of a variety of methods, showing that the results of our image-based methods and isolinebased methods converge, but our methods are about an order of magnitude faster than existing methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Bertin, in his seminal work on the semiotics of graphics <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, already pointed out the importance of a proper aspect ratio for the perception and readability of diagrams. Hereafter, this influence was studied for decades, especially for widely-used visualization techniques such as line charts and scatter plots. A number of approaches for the automatic selection of aspect ratios were developed for these techniques.</p><p>Banking methods for line charts. Cleveland et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> were the first to systematically study how the aspect ratio influences the perception of line charts. Their user studies show that judging the slope ratio between two adjacent line segments is most accurate when the orientation resolution (range of orientations of the two involved line segments) is maximized. They also showed that maximizing the orientation resolution is equivalent to centering the absolute value of the mid-angle (average orientation) at 45 • . This is known as the banking to 45 • principle, which is the foundation of most aspect ratio selection methods. More recent work by Talbot et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> found that the ability to estimate slopes is sub-optimal when the mid-angle is 45 • . Nevertheless, most existing methods still focus on optimizing for an aspect ratio that banks lines in the visualization to 45 • . Based on the 45 • principle, Cleveland et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and various other researchers developed a number of aspect ratio selection methods, including median absolute slope (MS), average absolute slope (AS), average absolute orientation (AO), and arc length weighted average absolute orientation (AWO). All these methods attempt to center the slopes (or orientations) of line segments around a value of one (or 45 • ). MS and AS bank the median and average absolute slope of line segments to one, whereas AO and AWO bank the average absolute orientations to 45 • . AWO weights the average absolute orientation by the lengths of the line segments; doing so it produces more satisfactory results for most cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Heer and Agrawala <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> developed two methods to directly compute the orientation resolution: global orientation resolution (GOR) and local orientation resolution (LOR). Since GOR considers all pairs of line segments in a plot, it is usually slow, whereas LOR considers only successive pairs of line segments, so it is much faster, but it tends to select aspect ratios that are excessively large or small. By using an L 1 norm in LOR, L 1 -LOR <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> was found to produce more reasonable aspect ratios for most data.</p><p>Rather than following the 45 • principle, Guha and Cleveland <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> suggested the resultant vector (RV) method, which banks the RV of a line plot to one. RV is the ratio of the total variation of line segments in y and x direction. Though its perceptual foundation is not clear, the method produces good results. Similar to RV, the arc length based (AL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> method is also not based on the 45 • principle; it selects the aspect ratio by minimizing the arc length of a line chart. Talbot et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> showed that RV can be interpreted as AL using the Manhattan distance metric, and thus, both methods share several empirical advantages such as parameterization invariance, robustness, and low computational costs. Recently, Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> showed parameterization invariance of AL, RV, and AWO using line integrals, and proved that RV and AL tend to satisfy the 45 • principle. Through a systematic evaluation of most aspect ratio selection methods, they showed that RV and L 1 -LOR have complementary properties for revealing different data patterns of interest, and thus, they proposed a dual-scale banking method that takes advantages of RV and L 1 -LOR.</p><p>Banking methods for scatter plots. The aspect ratio selection methods above can only handle 1D functions presented as line charts. However, the 2D data may not be represented as a 1D function in general, e.g., 2D distributions of data samples, 2D scatter plots, as well as many other common forms of 2D visualizations.</p><p>For such visualizations, a number of banking methods have been proposed. From a perceptual point of view, banking ellipse-shaped clusters to circles seems to be a preferable solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, since ellipses have an orientation, which may interfere with the perception of the clusters <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. Cleveland et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> fitted continuous LOESS curves (local polynomial regression) to the data of a scatter plot and banked the curves to find the aspect ratio. A drawback of these methods is that if the data does not have a clear correlation (or trend) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, the LOESS curve will not be able to characterize the data, e.g., by separating clusters appropriately. Talbot et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> converted a scatter plot into a density field by kernel density estimation, computed the isolines, and used the line segments as input to existing aspect ratio selection methods. They showed that AL and MS produce good aspect ratios for most data by banking ellipses to circles. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> evaluated a variety of aspect ratio selection methods on 2D scatter plots and showed that AWO, RV, and AL usually select similar aspect ratios. Although their approach works well for most data, it may not produce reasonable results if there are insufficient isolines or the density field Step 1 is obsolete, if the input data is already given as a density field.</p><p>does not well characterize the data. In this work, we avoid isolines in the computation, and formulate our method to work directly with the 2D density functions. Thus, we can bypass the isoline extraction, which is typically time-consuming and error-prone.</p><p>Fink et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> proposed an alternative approach that works directly with data points in the scatter plot based on a Delaunay triangulation. Although the approach is able to produce reasonable aspect ratios for some datasets, it does not have any perceptual foundation, and thus, its results might not be consistent with the user preference. Moreover, computing and processing a Delaunay triangulation to determine the aspect ratio is an expensive process that takes several minutes for a scatter plot with only a thousand points <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. As shown by the evaluation, our results are more favored by the users. Furthermore, our extended image-based RV can be solved in a closed form, which is faster than all previous methods, and the result is also close to the isoline-based approach with a large amount of isolines; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>.</p><p>The co-area formula. An important inspiration for our work is the co-area formula <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> from geometric measure theory. This formula expresses the integral over the level sets of a function as the integral of the function itself, where we use the term "level set" as interchangeable with isolines in 2D or isosurfaces in 3D. We are not the first to use this formula for data visualization. It has been successfully employed in other visualization contexts to generalize discrete methods by including density representations over a continuous domain. One example is the computation of histograms (frequency plots) for isovalue statistics of 3D scalar fields visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. Other examples include the continuous variants of scatter plots <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, parallel coordinates <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, function plots <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and projected multidimensional attribute spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. One of our use cases is the aspect ratio optimization for continuous scatter plots. Here, the density representation for continuous scatter plots <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> can be used as the direct input, thus improving the perception of these 2D diagrams. This is complementary to, and can be combined with, other methods, such as feature highlighting in continuous scatter plots <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and automatic selection between line charts and scatter plots for displaying time series <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">IMAGE-BASED ASPECT RATIO SELECTION MODEL</head><p>In this section, we first review isoline-based aspect ratio selection approaches and identify their drawbacks. Then, we derive our imagebased approach using the co-area formula <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> to enable us to work directly with the density fields, and finally show how AWO, RV, and AL can be extended through our image-based approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Isoline-Based Aspect Ratio Selection Approaches</head><p>The core assumption of existing isoline-based approaches is that the input data plot can be represented by finite isolines extracted from the density field of the plot. Then, we can apply conventional methods to select aspect ratio (denoted as α) based on the extracted isolines. Considering that the input data plot is scaled to a square domain denoted as Ω without loss of generality, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">X = { x 1 , • • • ,</formula><p>x n } is a set of n sample points in the given data plot, the isoline-based approaches have the following three major steps for computing the aspect ratios (see also the running example shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>):</p><p>(i) Density field construction. This step is obsolete if the input is already given as a density field (e.g., from continuous scatter plots <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> or from an image). In the case of scatter plots, a density field is constructed from the sample points:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Φ : x i −→ ρ( x i ) , where x i ∈ Ω ⊂ R 2 and ρ ∈ R .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Since the solution of α is unknown at the moment, the density field is simply constructed in Ω with a default aspect ratio α = 1. The approach constructs the density field based on the prominence of x i in Ω using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE):</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ρ( x) = 1 n n ∑ i=1 K H ( x − x i ) , for x ∈ Ω ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where K H ( x) is a kernel function with bandwidth matrix H. Typical choices for the kernel function are Gaussian and Epanechnikov functions, and we use the Gaussian function here. Typically, the density field is sampled on a uniform grid (image) over the domain of Ω. (iii) Aspect ratio computation. In the last step, the approach gathers the line segments of the isolines, and applies an existing aspect ratio selection method (e.g., AL or RV) to determine the aspect ratio.</p><p>If AL is used, we denote the overall approach as isoAL; if RV is used, we denote it as isoRV for the rest of the text. Since some of the methods for selecting the aspect ratio are parametrization-dependent, we need a dense coverage by the isolines to obtain an accurate α. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> presents results with a simple data set to illustrate the effect of m (or the number of isolines) on aspect ratio selection. We extract different numbers of isolines (a)-(c) from the same density field (d) using varying m, and then compute the aspect ratios from the extracted isolines using isoRV. The results shown in (a)-(c) show that a coarse sampling (m = 5) might not sufficiently characterize all structures in the density field, whereas a finer sampling (m = 16) would produce many isolines, even for such simple data. Our image-based approach (e) bypasses the isoline extraction and finds the aspect ratio directly from the density field. It is equivalent to considering isolines of all isovalues in the density field domain, thus our aspect ratio result (e) is close to isoRV's result when m is large (c).</p><p>Therefore, we can see that the isoline-based approach heavily relies on two factors: (i) a sufficient number of isolines (usually densely sampled) and (ii) a density field that faithfully represents the data. In contrast, our approach bypasses the first aspect and introduces an anisotropic kernel to address the second aspect; by these means, it is able to generalize the aspect ratio selection for general 2D diagrams.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">2D Integral Representation</head><p>To characterize all patterns in a 2D visualization, we may increase m to sample more isovalues and extract more isolines (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>). In theory, when m tends to infinity, we would have considered isolines of all isovalues in the density range. However, this would produce a large amount of isolines, so having a large m will be too costly for the computation. As suggested by Marsden and Tromba <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, an infinite sum of all isolines is equivalent to the integral over the associated density field. Their work motivated us to derive a new formulation that works directly with the density field instead of the isolines.</p><p>In the following, we denote Ω α as the domain with aspect ratio α, where Ω α is obtained by stretching or compressing the square domain Ω (or Ω 1.0 ) in y direction. Moreover, we denote ρ α and L α (t i ) as an α-stretched density field and isoline set L(t i ), respectively, in Ω α . Now, let us consider a single isoline set L α (t i ) that corresponds to isovalue t i . As suggested by Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, several existing aspect ratio selection methods can be formulated as an optimization of a line integral, say f , which depends on the input data X and aspect ratio α. Hence, we can integrate over the line segments (or arc length elements ds) along L α (t i ), and formulate the following objective:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">min α∈(0,∞) L α (t i ) f ( X, α) ds .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Next, since an infinite sum of all isolines is equivalent to integrating the density field, we can consider all possible isolines sampled over all isovalues in the density range through the following integration:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">min α∈(0,∞) 1 0 L α (t) f ( X, α) ds dt .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where we use t instead of t i due to the integration; note that the density range has been normalized to [0,1], therefore we have t ∈ [0, 1]. Since a numerical integration over a large amount of curves is computationally very expensive, we apply the co-area formula <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> to the problem and convert the integrals over the range of isovalues to integrals over the domain in which the isolines are defined. In this way, Eq. (4) can be re-formulated as </p><formula xml:id="formula_5">0 L α (t) f (X, α)ds dt = Ω α f (X, α)||∇ρ α ( x)|| d 2 x ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where f (X, α) is required to be Lipschitz continuous (i.e., f should have bounded gradient) and ∇ρ α ( x) is the gradient field of the density field ρ α . In practice, we work with a sampled version of the density field where the gradient always exists and is bounded. Note also that the infinitesimal distance element d x is in Ω α , while dx and dy are in Ω 1.0 ; since we scale Ω 1.0 in y direction (by α) to obtain Ω α , we thus have the following relationship between the two domains:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Ω α d 2 x = α Ω 1.0 dx dy .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Furthermore, the gradient magnitude term ||∇ρ α ( x)|| in Eq. (5) accounts for the uneven sampling of isolines over domain Ω α . By applying the chain rule, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">∇ρ α ( x) = ∂ ρ ∂ x , 1 α ∂ ρ ∂ y ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where ∂ ρ/∂ x and ∂ ρ/∂ y refer to the gradient of the density field ρ in x and y direction, defined over the domain Ω 1.0 . Substituting Eqs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">7</ref>into Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">5</ref>, we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">1 0    L α (t) f (X, α) ds    dt = Ω 1.0 f (X, α) α ∂ ρ ∂ x , ∂ ρ ∂ y dx dy,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>which provides the foundation for extending the existing aspect ratio selection methods to directly process density fields while avoiding isolines. Note that this 2D integral form does not require ρ to be a probability density function; it can be any non-negative and unnormalized field. Hence, we refer our approach as an image-based approach, since it can be applied to any non-negative 2D field. It should be noted that this co-area representation can be combined with feature detection approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref> so that the selected aspect ratio can highlight features of interest, which is left for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Image-Based Extensions</head><p>Using the formulation we derived in Eq. (8) and the line integral forms from Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, we are now ready to create our image-based versions of several aspect ratio selection methods:</p><p>ImgAL. The arc length based (AL) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> selects α by minimizing the total arc length of line segments in the plot, while preserving the area under the plot. Since the arc length is inherently a variable of the line integral, the objective of AL can be reformulated (from <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>) as the following line integral:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">min α∈(0,∞) n ∑ i=1 1 √ α ||∆x i , α∆y i || = min α∈(0,∞) C 1 √ α ds ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where C is the set of line segments in the plot. Comparing Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">9</ref>with Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">3</ref>, we can see that f (X, α) of AL is simply 1/ √ α. Hence, by substituting f = 1/ √ α into Eq. (8), we obtain the objective of the image-based version of AL (denoted as imgAL):</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">min α∈(0,∞) Ω 1.0 √ α ∂ ρ ∂ x , 1 √ α ∂ ρ ∂ y dx dy ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where the gradient (∇ρ) at each point in Ω 1.0 is multiplied with the following area-preserving squeeze mapping:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">S α := √ α 0 0 1/ √ α .</formula><p>ImgAWO. AWO <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> selects an aspect ratio that banks the weighted average absolute orientations to 45 • :</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">min α∈(0,∞) ∑ i |θ i (α)|l i (α) ∑ i l i (α) − π 4 ,</formula><p>where θ i (α) is the absolute orientation and l i (α) the length of each line segment. Hence, AWO aims at finding a proper α, such that the mean density of the plotted curve is close to π/4. Like AL, AWO can be formulated using line integral terms:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">min α∈(0,∞) C |θ (α)|ds C ds − π 4 .<label>(11)</label></formula><p>However, since Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">11</ref>is not a single line integral as AL, we cannot directly apply Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">8</ref>to Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. Hence, we consider C in each line integral term as sets of isolines over all isovalues and apply Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">8</ref>to transform each line integral term in Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. By further expressing θ in the formulation using gradients ∂ ρ ∂ x and ∂ ρ ∂ y in Ω 1.0 , we can obtain the following objective of imgAWO:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">min α∈(0,∞) Ω 1.0 tan −1 α ∂ ρ ∂ x / ∂ ρ ∂ y α ∂ ρ ∂ x , ∂ ρ ∂ y dx dy Ω 1.0 α ∂ ρ ∂ x , ∂ ρ ∂ y dx dy − π 4 ,<label>(12)</label></formula><p>which is subject to the same optimization process as AL. For the derivation details, please refer to the supplemental materials.</p><p>ImgRV. The resultant vector (RV) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> takes the ratio of the total variation of line segments in x and y direction as the aspect ratio. Hence, we can write it in the following line integral form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">α = ∑ i |∆x i | ∑ i |∆y i | = C | cos θ | ds C | sin θ | ds .<label>(13)</label></formula><p>Similar to the derivation for imgAWO, we consider C as sets of isolines over all isovalues and apply Eq. (8) to each line integral term. Then, we replace cos θ and sin θ by using the gradients ∂ ρ ∂ x and ∂ ρ ∂ y of the density field in Ω 1.0 and obtain the following objective of imgRV:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">α = Ω 1.0 || ∂ ρ ∂ y || dx dy Ω 1.0 || ∂ ρ ∂ x || dx dy ,<label>(14)</label></formula><p>which can be regarded as the ratio between the total variations in x and y direction over the whole density field. Again, please refer to Appendix A for the derivation details. Since imgRV has a closed form, it is faster to compute than imgAWO and imgAL, for which we have to solve a minimization problem; see Section 5 for more details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">ANISOTROPIC KERNEL DENSITY ESTIMATION</head><p>A particularly interesting aspect of our method is that the kernels for constructing the density field are selected in relation to the data. The KDE associated with such kernels is referred to as anisotropic KDE.</p><p>Isotropic KDE. Before introducing anisotropic KDE, we first briefly review isotropic KDE. Given a 2D domain, a Gaussian kernel function models the density in a local region defined by where position x is expressed as a column vector. The bandwidth matrix H scales and rotates the region. Thus, the choice of H affects the precision of the density field in characterizing the data patterns. Typically, KDE adopts Silverman's rule of thumb <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> to determine a diagonal matrix for the bandwidth matrix H with two elements</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">K( x) = 1 2π | H| exp − 1 2 x T H −1 x ,<label>(15)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_18">H = h x 0 0 h y .</formula><p>For example, h x can be computed by</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">h x = 1.06 × min{s x , R 1.34 }n −1/5 ,<label>(16)</label></formula><p>where s x is the standard deviation of the input data points X in x direction and R = x [0.75n] − x [0.25n] is the difference between the 25% and 75% quantiles of {x i }. The value of h y is computed similarly. Such Gaussian kernels result in isotropic, axis-aligned elliptical density regions of the same size around each point, so the resulting density field may not represent the data patterns well (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4 (a)</ref>).</p><p>Anisotropic KDE. To better characterize the data patterns by the density fields, we introduce anisotropic Gaussian kernels. These kernels are selected in a data-aware manner, such that each kernel creates an elliptical density region aligned to the main orientation of the data around each data point. For each data point x i , we perform a principal component analysis (PCA) on its k nearest neighbors and obtain the corresponding eigenvectors {ν 1 i , ν 2 i } and the associated principal directions. Since the principal directions maximize data variance, we use them to adjust the shape of the Gaussian function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">H i = H [ν 1 i ; ν 2 i ] ,<label>(17)</label></formula><p>where H i is the bandwidth matrix of the i-th point. Thus, each point has its own H i and its associated elliptical region with an orientation that adapts to the local data pattern. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4(a)</ref> shows the density fields generated by isotropic KDE and anisotropic KDE, where we can see that the local orientation is clearly characterized. Accordingly, the plot shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4(d)</ref> with the aspect ratio selected by using the anisotropic density field clearly reveal the sin function, while the one in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4(c)</ref> is not able to reveal the pattern.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">NUMERICAL IMPLEMENTATION</head><p>Compared to isoline-based approaches, our image-based approach consists of only two steps: (i) density field construction and (ii) aspect ratio computation. To accelerate the k nearest neighbor search for constructing the anisotropic kernel function, we build a k-d tree over the input data points. In addition, since imgAL, imgAWO, and imgRV all need the gradient information, we sample a 2D uniform grid at a resolution of w g × h g over the density field ρ and perform the Sobel operator to compute the gradient field ∇ρ, where w g and h g are empirically set as 1000. Doing so, we are able to accelerate the computation of the integrals in Eqs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>, which are implemented as a Riemann sum over all grid points in the domain.</p><p>To calculate the optimal aspect ratio for imgAL and imgAWO, we numerically find the value that minimizes the objective functions from Eqs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> by using the conjugate gradient method <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Like Talbot et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, we parametrize the 1D search problem with log(α), this lets the optimization converge in less than 30 iterations. The optimal aspect ratio for imgRV can also be easily obtained by directly using Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref> presents an exemplary result in which all three methods find very similar optimal aspect ratios; a more comprehensive evaluation will be presented in Section 6.1.</p><p>We implemented our approach in R (see code in supplemental materials) and ran it on a machine with an Intel ® Core™ i5-4200H with 2.8 GHz dual-core CPU in double precision. Our experiments on 100 datasets showed that imgRV mostly took around 50 to 300 ms, thus allowing for interactive manipulation; see Section 6.1 for details. The performance could be further boosted up by exploiting parallel computation on the GPU.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">EVALUATION</head><p>We performed four experiments to evaluate our image-based methods. First, we quantitatively compared our methods with isoline-based methods (Section 6.1) for two purposes: (i) learn to see if our methods produce similar aspect ratios as isoline-based methods but in less time, and (ii) find out, which one of our three methods is fastest and most robust. Second, we studied the convergence of our image-based methods with isoline-based methods and the corresponding methods designed for line charts (Section 6.2). Next, we presented a parameter analysis to find proper parameters for the best method recommended by the first experiment (Section 6.3). Lastly, we configured the best method with proper parameters, and revisited the user study by Fink et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> to show that choices made by our method are mostly consistent with the user preferences (Section 6.4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Quantitative Comparison with Isoline-based Methods</head><p>Comparing extensively with various methods, Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> showed that the RV method not only produces similar results to classical methods such as AWO and AL, but also is the fastest and most robust. On the other side, Talbot et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> extended various aspect ratio selection methods designed for line charts (including RV) into isoline-based methods to work for scatter plots. Therefore, we selected the isolinebased RV method (isoRV) as a representative of isoline-based methods, but extracted a large number of isolines for isoRV to capture most of the structures in the data. To be specific, we computed a 1000×1000 density field for each dataset. In addition, we took out the effect of anisotropic KDE, and used isotropic KDE for both isoRV and our image-based methods. We only summarize the comparison results with isoRV in the following, detailed comparison results with most methods are presented in the supplementary material.</p><p>Datasets. For a comprehensive comparison, we gathered 100 scatter plots with substantial variations in terms of the number of data points, ranging from 200 to 5000. Among them, 71 datasets show the dimensionality reduction results provided by Sedlmair et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and the rest are real bivariate datasets collected from the UCI repository <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Measure. To find out if our methods produce similar aspect ratios as isoRV, we measured the relative deviation of the aspect ratios selected by our methods from the ones selected by isoRV:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">deviation = α imgX − α isoRV α isoRV * 100% ,<label>(18)</label></formula><p>where α imgX refers to α selected by imgRV, imgAL, or imgAWO.</p><p>Results. To summarize the deviation results for the 100 datasets, we created the boxplots shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6 (a)</ref>. These boxplots show that the deviations of aspect ratios selected by our methods are very small,  On top left, we show the convergence plots for two typical datasets, Page Blocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and Cars <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, indicating that when m reaches over 500, imgRV and isoRV select very similar aspect ratios, i.e., very low deviations. (b) Resulting dataset plots for the aspect ratios chosen by imgRV and isoRV. In (a) the result for 100 isovalues is out of the plot range, we indicated it by a dark transparent shadow.</p><p>ranging only from −2% to 1.5%; particularly, the range for imgRV is typically very small, revealing that the method typically selects the same aspect ratio as isoRV. Note also that we aim for precision in this part of the experiment, so we considered a large amount of isolines for isoRV with m = 1000. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref> (b) summarizes and compares the time performance of all four methods. In this part of the experiment, we used m = 500 to extract isolines for isoRV, since this is sufficient for isoRV to handle most datasets (see Section 6.2), and isoRV can perform faster. As seen from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6 (b)</ref>, imgRV is the fastest, it took less than 0.37 seconds consistently for all datasets; imgAL is the second, but it still took around 0.7 seconds, which is roughly two times slower than img-RV. In contrast, the other two methods, isoRV and imgAWO, required around 3.2 and 5.2 seconds. Therefore, we consider imgRV to be able to support interactive aspect ratio selection for typical datasets, which is about an order of magnitude faster than isoline-based methods.</p><p>Recommendation. After carefully inspecting the comparison results, we come up with the following two observations: (i) all three imagebased methods select similar aspect ratios as isoRV, where the maximal absolute deviations of the three methods are less than 2% ; and (ii) imgRV produces most similar results to isoRV, while it is the fastest among the four methods being compared. Therefore, we recommend imgRV as the representative method for our image-based approach.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Convergence Study</head><p>We refer the isoline-based methods and the original methods designed for line charts as geometric methods, since both work with line segments. In the second experiment, we compare their convergence with our image-based methods. Since the previous experiment showed that imgRV produces almost the same results as isoRV, we take imgRV as the representative of image-based methods. Furthermore, we take isoRV as the representative of isoline-based methods, and RV as the representative of the original methods designed for line charts.</p><p>imgRV vs. isoRV. Unlike our imgRV, the quality of aspect ratio selected by isoRV strongly depends on the amount of isolines. Hence, we tried different m over the 100 datasets in the previous experiment when using isoRV to select aspect ratios, and computed the deviations in aspect ratios using Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7</ref> (a) summarizes the results. From the boxplots, we can see that when isoRV has a sufficiently large amount of isolines (i.e., large m) as inputs, the aspect ratios selected by imgRV and isoRV converge. However, isoRV typically requires at least m=500 for most datasets. Thanks to the image-based formulation, our approach (imgRV) can bypass the isoline construction and directly compute the aspect ratios from the density fields.</p><p>imgRV vs. RV. By converting line charts to density fields, our methods can also be used to find aspect ratios for line charts. Since density fields are smooth representations of the original line charts, our imgRV may not produce similar aspect ratios as RV, which works on the unsmoothed polygonal data. Hence, if we properly smooth the data, imgRV and RV might produce similar aspect ratios. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figures 8 (a, b, c)</ref> show results produced with RV, smoothed RV, and imgRV using the CO 2 dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, where a similar upward trend is clearly observable in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figures 8 (b, c)</ref>.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figures 8 (d, e, f)</ref> show the Computer dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, which further confirms our observation that applying RV to smoothed data produces aspect ratios similar to the ones selected by imgRV.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Parameter Analysis</head><p>In the third experiment, we studied how to select the resolution of density fields and number of nearest neighbors for our image-based methods (typically, imgRV):</p><p>(i) Resolution of density fields. Patterns in data are generally better characterized by density fields of higher resolution, but this increases the required computing time. Hence, we performed an experiment to find the proper resolution for revealing all necessary aspects of the data while consuming less computing time. We considered four different resolutions: 100×100, 200×200, 500×500, and 1000×1000, and applied imgRV to compute the aspect ratio for each of the 100 datasets described in Section 6.1. To study the influence of the resolution, we again used the deviation measure defined in Section 6.1 and took the aspect ratios computed with the highest resolution as the references. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 9</ref> (a) summarizes the results for the 100 datasets. It shows that the deviations for a resolution of 500×500 are in a small range of [−0.2%, 0.15%], thus the aspect ratios selected with domain resolutions 500×500 are similar to those selected with 1000×1000. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 9</ref> (b) summarizes the time performance of imgRV for different resolutions; it shows that the computational time increases non-linearly with the domain resolution. Considering these two results, we recommend 500×500 as the default resolution for our density fields.</p><p>(ii) Number of nearest neighbors (k). Next, we attempted to empirically find a proper value of k for constructing the anisotropic density fields; see Figures 4 and 10 for results on two typical datasets. From the analysis, we found that similar k tends to produce similar aspect ratios, but if k is too large, it might lead to obscuration of interesting patterns; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 10</ref> (d). Therefore, we set the default k as five and use this value to produce all the results shown in the paper.</p><p>Initially, we attempted to perform an analysis with the deviation measure to explore imgRV and isoRV for different k, similar to the previous experiments. However, k affects the density fields and so are imgRV and isoRV, so both methods produce similar aspect ratios for varying k. However, since imgRV allows interactive exploration, users may adjust k to explore the plot like multi-scale banking. Indeed, k is datadependent; in the future, we plan to investigate ways to automatically decide proper values of k in terms of the data characteristics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Revisiting the Study of Fink's Method</head><p>In the last experiment, we revisited the study in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> to show that our method yields results that are quite close to the ones produced by the best two criteria in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, but also consistent with the user preferences. Fink et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> studied various geometric criteria to select aspect ratios, and found that the criteria of minimizing the total length and minimizing the mean uncompactness yielded the best results, so we compared our method mainly with these two criteria. Since neither the implementation nor the user study result of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> is available, we applied our method only to the available data shown in the paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Five test datasets from <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The effectiveness of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> was demonstrated using five synthesized datasets, among which three had varying number of clusters and two had different data trends. Note that we obtained the datasets from the authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. By applying imgRV to the datasets, we obtained the results shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 11</ref>, showing that our results are quite close to the ones generated by the "minimizing the mean uncompactness" criteria, where all clusters and trends are clearly visible. In this sense, the results from our method and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> are comparable. We compared the performance by running our method on the similar machine. For the set with four mixed clusters, their method required around 5 sec. while our method only took 0.2 sec. User selection. Next, we further revisited the user study in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> to learn how well our selected aspect ratios match the user preferences. However, the user study result in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> is unavailable, so we took only the user study result in the paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> for comparison; see the top row in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref>, which has clearly shown that our result is closer to the user preferred one.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, a data plot shown in a Nature article <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> was taken as an input to see whether the method <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> produced a similar aspect ratio. Assuming that the authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> have carefully adjusted the aspect ratio for producing the plot, we took the same plot as input and applied our method to select an aspect ratio, which was also found to be closer to the original aspect ratio; see the bottom row in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref>. In the future, we plan to perform a large-scale user study to confirm the findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">EXTENSIONS</head><p>In this section, we present three extensions that utilize the capability of our image-based methods for a proper aspect ratio selection.</p><p>Region-of-interest (ROI) banking. Our image-based approach operates directly on the density field, so it inherently allows the user to select an ROI and then banks the diagram for the data patterns in the ROI. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 13</ref> shows an example dataset that has two major patterns: an upward trend with sparse data points on top and a dense cluster at the bottom. By specifying an ROI (red and blue boxes shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 13</ref> (a)), a user is able to highlight patterns in the ROI, since our method adapts the aspect ratio accordingly (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 13 (b, c)</ref>).</p><p>Multi-scale banking. For line charts, a single aspect ratio might not show all patterns of interest. Therefore, Heer and Agrawala <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> proposed the idea of multi-scale banking, which combines spectral analysis with the banking to 45 • principle to automatically select multiple aspect  ratios and to show patterns of interest at different scales.</p><p>Our image-based approach can also be extended to support multiscale banking. For this, we build a Gaussian pyramid on the input density field and apply our imgRV method to compute the optimal aspect ratio for each image in the Gaussian pyramid. Once we obtain the aspect ratios, we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> to ignore similar aspect ratios, i.e., aspect ratios that are less than 1.25 times of the previous (larger scale) ratio. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 14</ref> shows a result with three selected aspect ratios for highlighting patterns of interests at different scales.</p><p>General image data. Our image-based approach can also handle general image data, simply by converting input images into scalar density fields, e.g., by using color2gray <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> (for color images) to obtain grey scale images, and then applying a Gaussian filter to smooth them. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 15</ref> shows an example image collected from the Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. After cropping the relevant part of the image in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 15 (a)</ref>, we converted it to a density field (b) and then applied our approach to finding a better aspect ratio. The image scaled by applying our selected aspect ratio in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 15</ref> clearly shows the Gaussian envelope of the weather variation, which is obscured in the original input. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 16</ref> shows another example for a density function plot (or continuous scatterplot), which is from a CT facial deformity dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Our image-based method enables us to directly compute a good aspect ratio from the density field for showing the arch structure more prominently in the density-based image data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In this paper, we introduced a generic image-based approach for selecting a good aspect ratio for 2D diagrams, which allows to find similarly good aspect ratios as existing methods in less time. Derived from Federer's co-area formula, we are able to generalize any previous aspect ratio selection method based on a line integral representation to an image-based method. To more faithfully characterize the data patterns, we adopted anisotropic kernel density estimation to construct the necessary density fields. A comprehensive quantitative comparison to previous isoline-based methods shows that our image-based resultant vector (imgRV) method is faster and more robust than existing methods. In addition, we revisited the evaluation of Fink et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, and showed that our approach is able to perform similarly to the best method of Fink et al. for the tested data, while our selected aspect ratios better match the user preferences. Finally, we presented three extensions for our approach: region-of-interest banking, multi-scale banking, and selecting aspect ratios for general image data.</p><p>For future work, we plan to conduct a large-scale user study to find out to what extent the aspect ratio selected by our approach is able to reveal different patterns in the visualizations. Furthermore, we want to spotlight some fundamental topics that have so far been neglected. For example, we see a need to better examine the perceptual foundations of aspect ratio optimization, i.e., there is a need for more refined models that might go beyond banking to 45 • . As recognized by Talbot et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, the assumption that a line with a 45 • angle is optimal for perception is disputable, since in our opinion it cannot differentiate between ±45 • . It would also be interesting to study the perceptual implications of dealing with data clusters in scatter plots, i.e., whether circles are in fact optimal in this scenario. Lastly, it would also be interesting to explore the selection of k for anisotropic KDE by using the scagnostic approach from <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> in order to characterize the data more accurately.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Comparative overview of the isoline-based (blue arrows) and our image-based approach (red arrows).
